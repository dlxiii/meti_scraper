Govt drafts framework for offshore wind in EEZ, will set up stakeholder councils

(Government statement, Jan 26)
•  METI and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism wrote a draft framework for
managing stakeholder interests in EEZ offshore wind projects.
•  They suggested setting up a stakeholder council for each project to ensure maritime safety and
protect the ocean environment.
•  The council will comprise the national govt, project operator, fishing community, academia, and
the municipalities and relevant organizations.

•  The national govt will centralize negotiations with the fishing community.
•  The project operators are required to monitor and report environmental impact analysis to the
council after they obtain licenses. The govt plans two types of license – 1) provisional, and 2)
formal.




Japan’s hydrogen market to reach ¥5 trillion by 2050 - PWC
(Company report and Denki Shimbun, Jan 24)
•  PricewaterhouseCoopers issued a report on Japan's hydrogen market. The report focuses on the
domestic hydrogen market, including hydrogen production, conversion to ammonia or liquefied

hydrogen, transportation, reconversion to hydrogen, and storage. The market size for these
processes is projected to expand to ¥520 billion by 2030 and ¥5.12 trillion by 2050.
•  Production accounts for the largest share, reaching ¥350 billion in 2030 and ¥3.35 trillion in 2050.
Profit margins by 2050 are expected to be 19% for production, 29% for transportation, and 36%
for conversion/storage, increasing downstream.
•  By 2050, the share of gray hydrogen derived from fossil fuels with CO2 emissions during

production is expected to drop 42 percentage points to 5%. Blue hydrogen that removes CO2
during production is expected to rise 4 points to 30%. Green hydrogen derived from renewable
energy is anticipated to increase 39 points to 65%.




Iwate Pref to designate ‘red zones’ as off-limits for wind power generation
(Iwate Nippo, Jan 20)
•  Iwate Pref plans to designate “red zones”, or areas unsuitable for wind power projects, to protect
rare species of animals.
•  Such areas will cover up to 40% of local woodlands as the rule will apply to areas within 1 km from

the habitat of rare animals like the Japanese golden eagle.
•  CONTEXT: The plan was unveiled after an Iwate govt meeting on Jan 18 to discuss the proposal
for a 168 MW project by Renova in Morioka City. The decision stems from concerns over
4



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

communities’ dissatisfaction with results of environmental studies for wind projects. Given the
favorable wind conditions, Iwate is popular among firms seeking to build wind farms.
• TAKEAWAY: Renova’s proposal has apparently contributed to the decision to tighten rules on zoning for wind
power generation. In Feb 2023, Renova’s proposal, which included several area options, was harshly criticized
by Iwate’s governor on the grounds that the firm failed to include several areas specified in laws on protection

of natural resources in its initial report, and failed to assess the environmental impact on the area for the
project.




Sapporo City and Hokkaido propose deregulated GX business zones
(Government statement, Jan 23)
•  Sapporo City and Hokkaido Pref govts have made a joint proposal to the Financial Services Agency

(FSA) to set special business zones in the city and elsewhere in Hokkaido to attract energy
transition businesses and investors from overseas.
•  Sapporo’s proposal includes creating special zones to promote SAF, hydrogen, offshore wind,
storage batteries, next gen semiconductors, power and hydrogen transport, subsea power cable
installations and data centers.
•  Sapporo and Hokkaido proposed to relax some regulations in the zones, Hokkaido governor
Suzuki said in a news conference on Jan 24.

•  CONTEXT: On Jan 16, the FSA has called on municipalities to write proposals to attract domestic
and overseas businesses to their jurisdictions. The agency plans to create “special zones for
financial and asset management businesses” to implement the municipality initiatives. The special
zone proposal deadline is Feb 16.




MoE to calculate seaweed CO2 absorption in GHG emissions
(Nikkei, Jan 22)
•  The MoE decided to include absorption of CO2 by seaweed and seagrass in calculating GHG
emissions and absorption. This is a world-first initiative, and around 360,000 tons of absorption

from seaweed and seagrass is estimated for FY2022.
•  CONTEXT: This falls under the framework of Japan's reporting obligations under the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change. In April 2023, Japan reported 2,300 tons of blue
carbon from mangroves in FY2021, but did not measure seaweed and seagrass impact.




MoE, METI in talks on subsea CCS regulations
(Japan NRG, Jan 26)
•  The MoE and METI are in talks on the subsea CCS regulatory framework, whether to write a

separate law for the subsea CCS, or incorporate it into the CCS law proposal to be drafted by
METI.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The ministries will make a decision in the next few weeks, before the Cabinet approves the
submission of the proposed laws to the Diet possibly in Feb.
•  CONTEXT: On Jan 19, a MoE panel made a proposal to the MoE Minister on the subsea CCS
regulation, reflecting public feedback. The panel suggested a longer licensing period for subsea
CCS businesses, instead of the proposed five years. It also said public feedback in the areas

affected by the carbon storage should be required before issuing the licenses, and that clear
guidelines on monitoring the impacts of subsea CCS are needed. The CCS operators need to
watch the overall carbon impacts in the sea, not just leakage.




Thai-Japan CCS project could hold 40 mln tons of CO2 per year: PTTEP
(Japan NRG, Jan 25)
•  A group of Thai and Japanese companies are forging ahead in developing a carbon capture and
storage (CCS) project in Thailand that early indicators could store as much as 40 mln tons of CO2 a
year by 2050, said CEO of Thai energy company PTTEP, Montri Rawanchaikul, in an interview

during a Rystad Energy webinar.
•  A seismic survey that involves, from the Japan side INPEX and state-run JOGMEC, is due to start in
2025, the CEO said. The Thai side hopes that Japan passes a law on carbon storage this year and
will utilize the legal framework to develop the project.
•  Montri also appealed for a common global MMV (measuring, monitoring, and verification)
framework to help CCS projects move towards commercial reality.
•  CONTEXT: At the start of January, PTTEP announced the start of a study together with INPEX and

JOGMEC, as well as the Thai Department of Mineral Fuels, to realize the Northern Gulf of Thailand
CCS Exploration project. The study reviews the subsurface conditions in the Gulf of Thailand and
uses experience gained from the PTTEP’s separate CCS initiative at the Arthit gas field.




Sumitomo Corp invests in Norwegian CO2 capture company
(Company statement, Jan 22)
•  Sumitomo Corp has invested in Inherit Carbon Solutions, a Norwegian startup that specializes in
removing CO2 through biomethane production. The company didn’t state the amount of the
investment.

•  Starting in 2025, with an estimated volume of 2 mln tons per year, Inherit plans to use CO2
geological storage in the Nordic region to create CDR-derived carbon credits.
•  The partnership will focus on securing storage providers in Europe, North America, and Asia; and
to accelerate the development of the CCUS value chain.
•  CONTEXT: Inherit has already signed sales contracts with companies such as Microsoft. In
addition to investing in Inherit, Sumitomo will procure the CDR-derived credits and sell them to

other enterprises. Sumitomo has also invested in the U.S.-based startup, Global Thermostat.
According to a report in Denki Shimbun, the market for carbon credits issued by utilizing negative
emission technologies such as CO2 capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy-generated CO2
capture and storage (BECCS) is expected to grow from $2.1 billion to $80 billion in 2030.

ENEOS's field study for DAC expected to retrieve 75 kg of CO2 daily
(Denki Shimbun, Jan 24)
•  ENEOS unveiled its Direct Air Capture device designed to retrieve CO2 directly from the
atmosphere. The company is the first in the Asia-Pacific region to install a DAC device

manufactured by Swiss startup Climeworks.
•  Since December, ENEOS has done experimental verification of the device, examining the amount
and concentration of CO2 retrieved.
•  The anticipated daily CO2 retrieval is about 75 kg. The field test is expected to last for more than a
year. The company intends to eventually manufacture synthetic fuels using CO2 and hydrogen
recovered by the device.
•  CONTEXT: Climeworks’ DAC system works by adsorbing CO2 from the atmosphere using filters,

then heating it to about 100°C to recover the CO2. Heating begins automatically when CO2
accumulates in the filter, and the absorbed CO2 is recovered in a gaseous state at atmospheric
pressure. Since the device operates on electricity, using carbon-free power means no CO2 is
emitted.




Opinion: Japan should lead the way on disclosure of climate risk
(Nikkei Asia, Jan 19)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by Suzuki Sachiko, who serves as the climate and energy

analyst for Market Forces in Melbourne.
•  Many Asian companies are providing climate-related information. Yet, disclosures often lack crucial
details on financial risks associated with climate change. Diverse international and national
reporting standards contribute to the problem.
•  The International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation has introduced new sustainability
disclosure guidelines, with a global baseline for comprehensive climate-related risk and
opportunity disclosures.

•  Japan can lead Asia by making this standard mandatory for listed companies, addressing the
undisclosed financial impact of climate stress tests.
•  Investors can help ensure that companies adhere to the new standard, demanding adequate
disclosure.




Mitsubishi HC Capital invests €700 mln in Danish renewables firm
(Company statement, Jan 19)
•  Mitsubishi HC Capital invested €700 mln (¥110 billion) in Danish renewables producer, European

Energy, aiming to expand in Europe.
•  The Mitsubishi group firm is set to acquire a 20% stake.
•  CONTEXT: European Energy operates in 28 countries around the world, but mainly in Europe; and
has a cumulative development track record of more than 3 GW of renewables and a development
and construction pipeline of over 60 GW.

GE Hitachi advances its SMR project but economical viability is in question
(Nikkei, Jan 22)
•  GE Hitachi is developing the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) BWRX-300, and will build the first unit in
Canada by 2028, with potential orders from the U.S. and Poland.

•  Yet, there are concerns about economic viability. A similar project was canceled by NuScale Power
in the U.S.
•  CONTEXT: In 2022, PM Kishida mentioned the potential adoption of SMR into Japan’s energy mix.
Since they’re much smaller than large reactors, SMRs reduce construction costs and timeframe
thanks to factory manufacturing and on-site assembly. SMRs have a capacity of up to 300 MW per
unit, allowing them to be situated in places unsuitable for larger NPPs.
• TAKEAWAY: Critics of SMRs point out that some designs use chemically exotic fuels and coolants that may

generate toxic waste. Thus, while SMR construction may present advantages in costs, there are still waste
disposal and environmental issues. Japan’s nuclear roadmap includes SMRs as one of the technologies to
pursue, but it is only one of several reactor options in the national strategy.




Shipping, technology companies close contracts on ammonia-fueled ship construction

(Company statement, Jan 25)
•  Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK), Japan Engine Corp, IHI Power Systems and Nihon Shipyard
signed contracts to construct the world’s first ammonia-fueled medium gas carrier. Construction is
slated for completion in Nov 2026.
•  The vessel – 40,000 cubic meters in size – will be built by Japan Marine United Corp; Japan Engine
Corp will make the main engine that will run on fuel with up to 95% ammonia; and IHI Power
Systems will make the auxiliary engine that runs the power generator. The fuel ammonia ratio is

80%.
•  CONTEXT: The cost is ¥12.3 billion, with the govt financing ¥8.4 billion from the Green Innovation
Fund. Last year, based on the findings of this project, the Japanese govt filed an ammonia-fueled
ship safety standard proposal to the International Maritime Organization (IMO).




Yamanashi Pref to build 14.8 MW green hydrogen plant
(Japan NRG, Jan 25)
•  Yamanashi Pref, industrial gas supplier Tomoe Shokai and glass manufacturer Himeji Rika will build
a 14.8 MW green hydrogen plant in the company’s quartz glass factory in Tamura City (Fukushima

Pref). The plant begins operations in FY2025.
•  The plant will have a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer with a capacity to produce
600 metric tons / year of vehicle-grade 99.97% hydrogen. It will source certified green power from
third parties for the electrolysis.
•  Yamanashi Pref will float a tender for the PEM electrolyzer by the end of March.
•  The hydrogen will be supplied to Himeji Rika and to other local consumers by truck.

• TAKEAWAY: This will be Japan’s second largest green hydrogen plant after the 16 MW PEM Suntory plant in
Yamanashi Pref that will come on-stream in early 2025.




Masdar, INPEX, Tokyo Gas, etc to collaborate on e-methane study in UAE

(Company statement, Jan 23)
•  Masdar, INPEX, Tokyo Gas, and Osaka Gas will collaborate in a study on e-methane production in
Abu Dhabi. Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas recently joined the initiative, aiming to off-take e-methane
equal to 1% of their annual city gas demand.
•  They’ll study feedstock production, including green hydrogen and CO2 and e-methane production
and transportation. The goal is to establish an e-methane supply chain from the UAE.




Iwatani, Soma Gas to test delivering hydrogen-liquefied propane gas to homes

(Company statement, Jan 22)
•  In Jan 2025, Iwatani Corp and Soma Gas group will launch a field test to supply a mix of hydrogen
and LP gas via pipelines to 80 homes in Minamisoma City (Fukushima Pref); the first attempt using
legacy gas pipelines.
•  The hydrogen-LP gas mix ratio has not been decided. They’ll determine the maximum hydrogen
ratio without overhauling the pipeline or home systems.
•  CONTEXT: In Aug 2023, NEDO solicited proposals for hydrogen for regional economic
development. The Iwatani-Soma Gas proposal was one of the four chosen.

• TAKEAWAY: Each project will receive a NEDO grant of ¥30 million. In return, the project owners are required
to commercialize their field tests and present to NEDO a business plan. The other three were building a blue
hydrogen supply chain in Mikasa City (Hokkaido), pipeline supply of carbon-free hydrogen in Susono City, and
carbon neutral hydrogen production and consumption in the Tohoku region.




PXP unveils solar car test drive data

(Japan NRG, Jan 24)
•  PXP Corp disclosed data from test drives of a Mitsubishi Motors EV model “i-miev” mounted with
its proprietary bendable chalcopyrite solar modules. From a 1 sq/m-sized PV unit, 4.1 kWh/day of
power was generated. The modules, placed on the vehicle rooftop, occupied an area of 2 sq/m.
•  With a power output capacity of 360 watts, the vehicle drove 16 km in one day. Power efficiency
was 18%. Lithium ion batteries were used for power storage.
•  CONTEXT: PXP is developing a tandem-structured perovskite-chalcopyrite (copper-indium-

gallium-selenium). In this first test, the car was mounted with 332 pieces of small chalcopyrite
modules. The company plans to test modules with perovskite and chalcopyrite layers, which in
theory will have a 40% efficiency, in the next phase. Sharp’s bendable silicon module holds the
outside lab efficiency world record of 33.7%.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: The chalcopyrite modules also recorded 90°C when the car was parked in an area with almost no
wind. EVs have a motor that reaches 200°C, as well as power semiconductor and other devices releasing heat.
Since a lithium-ion-battery starts to degrade at 80°C, temperature control tech is important.





Nippon Paper commercializes fertilizer made of biomass ash
(Company statement, Jan 23)
•  Nippon Paper Industries will begin sales of fertilizer made from biomass ash to fertilizer
manufacturers and retailers this month.
•  The biomass plants use imported wood chips and palm kernel shells, and local wooden biomass as
feedstock.

•  The company has built a 5,000 metric tons / year fertilizer production capacity at the Yufutsu
biomass plant (Hokkaido) and a 300 tons / year capacity in Yatsushiro plant (Kumamoto Pref), and
obtained fertilizer supply permits last year.
• TAKEAWAY: Biomass is widely recognized as carbon neutral fuel, but there is no general approach on
positioning biomass ash in carbon accounting. Like many other biomass power plants in Japan, Nippon Paper
previously was disposing of the ash as industrial waste before using it for fertilizer production. The company,

however, does not attribute carbon credit to the ash and sells the fertilizer as regular fertilizer.

Japan launches first long-term decarbonization capacity auction, 4 GW to be offered

(Japan NRG, Jan 26)
•  On Jan 23, METI launched Japan’s first long-term power decarbonization auction; it is a subsection
of the capacity market aimed at promoting new non-fossil fuel projects and securing power supply
stability and predictability.
•  The main part of the bidding process is held from Jan 23 until Jan 30. The total capacity to be
offered is 4 GW. The scheme uses the pay-as-bid pricing system.
•  Unlike the main auction in the capacity market, successful bidders in the long-term decarbonization

auction will receive fixed capacity revenue for a period of 20 years. The auction is overseen by
OCCTO.
•  Contract results with the names of bidders and information on allocated capacity will be
announced in about three months from Feb 7.
•  CONTEXT: The new scheme was introduced due to an increase in use of renewables and with the
goal to support the construction of new or replacement power plants. It also aims to establish
energy safety nets for anticipated power supply shortages.

• TAKEAWAY: With the 20-year income guarantee, the scheme offers a structured avenue for new clean energy
businesses that couldn’t be introduced under 1-year contracts granted in the main capacity market auction due
to high investment costs. The mechanism has the potential to contribute to investment in power resources like
storage batteries and ammonia-firing.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Capacity auction payments to maintain power plants to reach ¥1.3 trillion this year
(Government statement, Jan 24)
o  OCCTO said the total amount raised this fiscal year to maintain 167 GW of power
capacity in FY2027 is set to reach ¥1.3 trillion. The amount is based on the main capacity
auctions held during FY2023.
o  The biggest payment was for capacity in the TEPCO catchment area, followed by Kansai

and Chubu. About 43% of payment will cover LNG/gas-fired generation. Coal will
account for 23.5%, pumped hydro for 13.3%, regular hydropower for 7.9% and nuclear
for 4.7% of the payments.
o  The total for FY2027 capacity is about 50% higher than for the same in FY2026,
indicating that the burden on operators of new plants will rise.
o  CONTEXT: These payments are made most by electricity retailers but also general

transmission and distribution companies. The money goes to power providers via an
auction system run by OCCTO. The capacity market was established in 2020 due to full
deregulation of the retail market and increasing use of renewables. The system is aimed
at reducing maintenance costs for electric power firms and preventing thermal power
resources from being kicked out of the market. Necessary supply capacity is secured four
years ahead.

ANRE steps up efforts for electricity markets reform, to ensure a balanced power supply
(Japan NRG/ Denki Shimbun, Jan 23)
•  To ensure a balanced power supply in the electricity market, ANRE’s committee on the power
markets reform that met on Jan 22 called on refocusing on six areas:
o  Full liberalization of retailing
o  Utilization of market functions
o  Wide-area expansion and neutralization of power transmission and distribution

o  Measures to ensure supply capacity
o  Improvement of business environment
o  Overseas trends in electric power system reforms
•  The members were briefed on the progress of the power system reforms to date and discussed
changes in the composition of power sources, energy prices, progress in reducing CO2 emissions
and the current status of the six priority areas.
•  Here are some of the comments from experts:

o  Commissioner Yotsumoto Hiroko called to quickly set up a venue to discuss elimination
of transitional tariffs, echoing METI on the importance of "consumer awareness of
electricity deregulation”.
o  Akimoto Keigo, chief researcher at RITE, pointed out that "with the cost of the electric
power business increasing, failure to pass on the cost of electricity to consumers will
distort the entire electric power system.”

o  Kanemoto Yoshitsugu, JEPX Chairman, voiced concerns over whether the capacity
market, supply-demand adjustment market and the wholesale electricity market, all set
up in conjunction with the power system reform, are aligned and operating consistently.
•  CONTEXT: The planned revision was initially envisioned as a means to ensure supply stability and
to cut the cost of energy, but it has received calls to address other challenges, such as steering the
market towards decarbonization. ANRE will hold sessions on the six topics with stakeholders in the
power industry until Feb 21.




NEC and Summit Energy collaborate in power supply and demand adjustment business

(Company statement, Jan 22)
•  Summit Energy, an electric power retailer, and NEC will collaborate and enter the electricity supply
and demand adjustment market.
•  Summit, which is a Sumitomo group company, will provide power generation resources and
develop bidding strategies and operation plans. NEC will manage the generation resources with
its aggregation cloud service. TEPCO will be the aggregation coordinator.

New power market entrants see share of sales drop for 13th month in a row
(EGC statement, Jan 19)
•  The volume of electricity sold in October was 63,150 GWh, up 1.9% YoY (but down 15.9% MoM),
according to the latest data published by the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission

(EGC).
•  The market share of new entrants (shin denryoku) fell to 16% of the total in October. This reflects
the decline in the volume of electricity sold by new players: down 11% YoY to 10,089 GWh (and
down 21.9% MoM). It was the 13th consecutive month of YoY declines.
•  Meanwhile, the volumes sold by retailers that are aligned with major utilities (EPCOs) increased
4.8% YoY to 53,061 GWh, (but down 14.7% MoM).




Tohoku Electric should scrap thermal plant upgrade if climate goal fails: MoE minister

(Government statement, Jan 26)
•  The MoE minister told Tohoku Electric to scrap upgrade plans for its thermal power plant in
Higashi Niigata if the utility fails to hit its 2030 GHG reduction goal.

Nikkiso develops pumps for ammonia-coal co-firing
(Japan NRG, Jan 23)
•  Nikkiso has developed pumps for ammonia-coal co-firing that can move fuel liquid ammonia out of
100-meter tall tanks to pipelines and to power generation units. It plans to deliver the equipment
to domestic power utilities by 2026, and subsequently to ammonia terminal operators overseas.
•  The pump’s main safety feature is “the submerged motor” protected in a container and closely

integrated with the pipes, and immersed into the liquid ammonia.
•  This technology has been used for small pumps but not for large energy facilities.
•  CONTEXT: Power generation requires tanks, pipelines, pumps and other facilities to operate at
scale. Nikkiso is the world’s largest producer of cryogenic pumps, used in LNG terminals, and their
experience made it possible to develop fuel ammonia pumps. The pump delivery in 2026 is good
timing as commercial scale ammonia-coal co-firing is expected to begin in 2027-2028.

• TAKEAWAY: Ammonia causes corrosion of steel and other materials, and although the equipment comes with
safety mechanisms, it might not be effective if corrosion causes the parts to break. Nikkiso declined to
elaborate on the steel material used for the parts that come directly in contact with ammonia. Their other
pumps use nickel alloys.

NEWS:     OIL,  GAS   &  MINING







PAJ’s chairman discusses recent increase in crude prices amid tensions in the Red Sea
(Japan NRG, Jan 25)
•  Petroleum Association of Japan’s Chairman Kito said at a news conference that the Dubai crude oil
price reached $80 per barrel. The rise is due to Middle East tensions and a partial halt in crude
production in North Dakota due to the cold wave.
•  The missile-drone attacks in the Red Sea have led to a 30% reduction in navigation through the

Suez Canal, increasing freight rates as journeys are now longer.
•  The chairman anticipates that the Dubai crude oil price will remain in the range of $75 to $90 over
the next month.
• TAKEAWAY: The Red Sea crisis led Japanese shipping companies NYK, Kawasaki Kisen and Mitsui O.S.K. to
halt transit in the area. Japan’s oil purchases, however, are mostly from the Persian Gulf; so, the impact is
minimal for now. That could change if tensions spill over.

ANALYSIS

BY TAKEHIRO MASUTOMO

TOP INTERVIEW: METI Director in charge of Aerospace and Defense

Japan NRG sat down with KUREMURA Masuo, Director of Aerospace and Defense
Industry Division at the Manufacturing Industries Bureau, METI, to discuss the latest
energy issues and outlook. Mr. Kuremura explained Japan’s strategy on clean fuels for
transport, the leading tech in next-gen aviation, and which countries and companies
the government is working with.


CLEAN TRANSPORT
Q: Are there any common solutions to decarbonize transport in general, or will each
sector (aviation, shipping, road) need its own solutions?

A: My feeling is, at this moment there is no single innovation or solution that can solve
all transport decarbonization needs. Whether it's for airplanes, sustainable aviation
fuel (SAF), electrification, fuel cells, direct combustion of hydrogen, lightweighting,
efficiency improvements, or operational enhancements, solutions differ significantly.
Therefore, it’s crucial to plant the seeds for various innovations.

Another thing to keep in mind is how the efficiency of a solution changes based on
market developments. In this sense, progress in innovation and market realities are
interconnected. So, we need to track progress gradually while pursuing various
options and improvements.

However, there are fundamental ideas that can apply to various sectors, such as SAF,
hydrogen, and electrification. So, rather than developing solutions exclusively for, say,
aviation, it is crucial to work on common technological foundations that can be
applied in the auto and energy space, among others.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF)
Q: To decarbonize aviation fuel, Japan seems to primarily focus on SAF. But there are
many ways to make SAF. Which technology / route does METI support as the most
suitable for the Japanese market?

A: The initial focus is on promoting a widespread adoption of established
technologies, such as HEFA using waste cooking oil. Then there’s high expectations
for the adoption of ATJ, a type of bioethanol-derived SAF. However, as waste cooking
oil is a finite resource, and bioethanol is derived from edible raw materials, relying
solely on these sources would be risky. There are already moves in Europe to regulate
biofuels derived from edible raw materials such as ATJ bioethanol on concern that its
proliferation could cause a food crisis.

In addition, to meet future increases in demand, we need to look at ways to produce a
certain volume of clean fuels synthetically. This could be through the synthesis of
hydrogen and CO2 to create eSAF. So, in a sense, while we’re relying initially on
HEFA and ATJ to lay the foundations, we must plan for the future with synthetic fuels
like eSAF.

20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

In Japan, this is how the combination looks like:
•  Cosmo Oil, JGC Holdings Corp, and Revo International – to recover waste
cooking oil and produce 30,000 kL of SAF by 2024-25
•  Idemitsu Kosan – to establish ATJ technology using bioethanol, targeting
100,000 kL of SAF by 2026
•  ENEOS Corporation – to research eSAF production, aiming for
commercialization by 2040.

Regardless of international efforts, it's crucial for us to increase domestic SAF supply.

Q: METI set an ambitious goal for the aviation industry: SAF use for 10% of fuel by
2030. How will you monitor whether airlines comply with the regulations? Are there
penalties?


A: Japan's projected supply of SAF in 2030 is expected to be approximately based on
the estimate that domestic SAF manufacturers can supply 1.92 million liters. This is
more than the expected demand from airlines. Therefore, we believe that the 10%
target is quite feasible. Additionally, together with the Agency for Natural Resources
and Energy and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), we
are conducting public-private discussions. There are ways to increase SAF volumes
further, and we are looking at various forms of support, including for large-scale
facility investments and tax breaks.

Specific conditions are being worked out by the MLIT, but the 10% target will be
applied within the Civil Aeronautics Law, which all airlines are expected to comply
with. As METI, we’ll enforce the regulation under the Energy Supply Structure
Enhancement Act and also actively support the supply side.

Q: By 2030, how much of Japan’s SAF will come from domestic/overseas sources?

A: The 1.92 million liters demand number for 2030 is essentially based on the
assumption that it is all or largely domestically produced SAF.

Initially, the focus is on boosting domestic SAF production. But our industrial policy is
not limited to providing SAF for Japan only. We believe there will be significant
opportunities for Japan to supply SAF in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Thus, our
goal is to promote the enhancement of Japanese refinery tech and other related
facilities, via large capital investments and tax incentives, to meet demand in the
broader Asian market.

We consider it crucial to expand the refining industry beyond domestic oil refineries,
to engage in overseas ventures and get evolved in the green chemicals industry. In
this sense, we believe it’s essential to think globally. While some products will be
manufactured in Japan, others may be produced overseas.

Additionally, with hydrogen-derived products like eSAF, we anticipate exploring
various approaches, such as importing green hydrogen to produce SAF domestically.
We also support the development, demonstration, and certification of technologies


21

related to SAF from non-edible sources, such as next-generation ethanol, algae, and
waste.

HYDROGEN, BATTERIES IN AVIATION
Q: The GX strategy mentions a potential development of next-generation aircraft
using hydrogen, batteries, and lightweight materials. What’s the status of these
developments?

A: There are various support initiatives funded from the budget and the GI (Green
Innovation) project. These include R&D into motors, batteries, power generators, new
composite materials, such as carbon fiber composites, and more. Additionally, for
hydrogen aircraft, there’s support for the manufacture of combustion systems for
direct combustion, pumps, and storage tanks. Depending on the project, we’ve
already succeeded in prototyping and testing these at the component level.

So, with each component tested, the next step is to integrate them into sub-systems
in which the parts seamlessly work together. We plan to demonstrate the functionality
of these sub-systems and progress toward integrating them into a complete aircraft.

In November 2023, the METI initiated a program to develop hybrid electric systems
and hydrogen fuel cell systems for aircraft. This program is currently open for
applications; we expect to work with those companies that show interest starting
about July 2024.


Q: In the U.S., startups like Universal Hydrogen, ZeroAvia, and H2FLY have completed
test flights using liquid hydrogen fuel. Some have formed partnerships with Japanese
airlines. How does the Japanese government view the development of this
technological cooperation? Will Japan try to design and manufacture hydrogen-fueled
aircraft also?

A: Japan already has expertise in handling hydrogen, not only for aircraft but also as
fuel cells in autos and for space-related applications. Components for such
technologies were successfully tested at the component level. The challenge now is to
move beyond waiting for someone to buy these components and actively create an
entire aircraft. Although there was a setback in February 2023 with the MSJ project,
our goal to create a complete aircraft remains unchanged. However, the lesson
learned is that it is a difficult challenge for a single entity that’s solely Japanese. We
recognize the need to integrate global resources, and in this sense, we aim to
collaborate with various OEMs on both aircraft and engine fronts.

While remaining an essential parts supplier, we also want to be an integration partner.
This perspective has been communicated to our existing OEM partners, emphasizing
that Japan, through METI, is supporting companies that are not just individual
components suppliers.

Q: For example, integration partners with Airbus or Boeing?

A: There are plenty of possibilities. Although we cannot disclose the exact nature of
various discussions, naturally, they are based on finding ways to develop next-


22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

generation carbon-neutral aircraft. There are expectations that Japan will be an
integration partner in these developments.

Q: What about battery-powered aircraft, what role does Japan plan to play in that
market?

A: We have several projects for decarbonization. Two are related to hydrogen: direct
combustion and fuel cells. Two more are based on combining SAF and electrification.
One program is about finding lighter materials that will improve the fuel efficiency and
handling of aircraft.

We don’t have any projects that look at electric motor aircraft powered exclusively by
batteries. With the current state of battery tech development, including solid-state
batteries, making planes that fly only on battery power is tricky – the aircraft tends to
be too heavy. So, we are looking at hybrid solutions. However, we actively support
R&D in batteries for other applications, like drones and electric vehicles (EVs).

Q: When should the general public expect to travel on next-generation clean aircraft?


A: Airbus has already announced plans to bring to market a hydrogen-powered
commercial aircraft by 2035 and set 2026 as the timeline for demonstration flights.
This serves as a benchmark for how Boeing will develop its aircrafts. Additionally,
projects in hybrid electric propulsion are underway. I believe these are feasible
timelines and we’re actively working as integration partners to make them a reality.

Q: Japan among the world’s first buyers of the Dreamliner aircraft. Will it also be the
first to embrace hydrogen-powered planes?

A: Being a launch customer definitely has its merits and, as METI, we want to support
the demand side, too. As I mentioned earlier, relying solely on SAF is not an option if
we are to achieve carbon neutrality. It's essential to explore aircraft-side development,
such as integrating SAF with hybrid electric propulsion, to look at systems that
combine hydrogen and other options. Thus, the recent partnership between hydrogen
powered aircrafts startups and JAL, where airlines are involved in new airplane
technologies aside from SAF, is indeed a welcome development.

CARBON EMISSIONS & CREDITS
Q: Airlines worldwide have strict goals for decarbonization. Can Japan achieve them?

A: This is an international agreement, so it's not just a matter of Japan achieving it or
not. We must work towards it. If, for some reason, we cannot hit these goals, CORSIA
may require some form of payment. That’s why we must speed up R&D into SAF, light
weight, hydrogen flight, fuel cells, and hybridization. Japan should leverage its
expertise in these areas and collaborate internationally.

Q: Is there potential for Japanese carbon credits (J-Credits) to be used by the airlines?

A: At this moment, even if it’s accepted on the J-Credit side, the credit won't be
accepted under CORSIA certification. So, in a way, if CORSIA acknowledges [the
validity of J-Credits], that should be acceptable.

INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
Q: Which countries or companies are potential partners or collaborators for Japanese
aviation?

A: Japan's aviation industry has a historical connection with Boeing in aircraft
development. Therefore, it is natural for us to consider how to grow together with
Boeing in the future. We are already engaged in discussions with them about
incorporating new carbon-neutral technologies into the next generation of aircrafts.
But collaboration with Airbus is also crucial. They launched the ZEROe project for
2035, and we would like to engage in discussions with them.

While we value our partnership with Boeing, we are open to collaboration with various
countries and companies. We want to ensure that our involvement is not limited to
Japan but extends to partnerships on an international level.

Q: One option often touted as a way for Japan to lower its transport emissions quickly
is to import more bioethanol and mix it with petroleum fuels. In many countries, the
bioethanol blend ratio is 10%, but in Japan the ratio is much lower. Will this change?

A: Brazil and the U.S. have a surplus of corn and would like to sell some of this excess
to Japan. If Japan can obtain it at a reasonable cost, going with this approach is
entirely feasible.


However, relying solely on imported bioethanol poses significant risks. Especially in
Europe, there is a heightened concern about edible fuels, specifically around biofuels
created from sources that can also be used for food. This could lead to regulation that
restricts the use of food-derived fuels in Europe’s aviation infrastructure. That would
make it challenging for us if aircraft that use such fuels cannot fly to European
countries.

We have no intention to decline the use of Brazilian or American [biofuel] products.
The emphasis from our side, however, is on a diversified portfolio. There is no
practical one-stop solution. From this perspective, international cooperation is highly
encouraged.

METI Begins Work on the Seventh Strategic Energy Plan

Japan needs more practical steps to revive nuclear power. Energy mix planning
should not be only about supply, but also demand. And, METI’s view that electricity
consumption in Japan will decline is wrong.

Those are some initial points raised by experts that were selected by METI to help
draft the country’s next Basic (Strategic) Energy Plan. The document is revised every
three years and serves as the basis for both state and private efforts. It will enter its
7th edition this year once a draft is released in late spring to early summer. Work on
this draft has officially begun.

Final approval of the new Basic Energy Plan will be on the agenda before the Diet
elections that are scheduled before September 2024. It will be followed by Cabinet
approval.

National strategies for the energy sector often serve as idealized projections that set a
course rather than precise roadmaps. Still, Japan's current Basic Energy Plan
foreshadowed a greater government emphasis on renewable energy and the
emergence of a new electricity source: the co-firing of hydrogen / ammonia. It also
served as the framework on which the government based its United Nation’s
commitment to reducing emissions 46% by FY2030.


The new edition of the Plan will cover a period that ends just three years shy of the
end of this decade, but METI will likely extend the horizon of the 7th edition to at
least 2035. The main trajectory, however, will survive drastic changes with the
country’s 2030 and 2050 commitments due to remain in place.

As government officials struggle to marry climate commitments with energy realities,
Japan NRG looks at the status of the current discussions hosted by METI.

First meeting
Official discussions on revisions to the Plan first aired in public on December 18, when
the Strategic Policy Committee – under the auspices of the Advisory Committee for
ANRE – held its first meeting on the matter.

From METI’s perspective, the important context for a revision of the Plan was the
change in international circumstances since 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
triggered a range of economic sanctions against Moscow that disrupted energy
markets, and the recent spike in tensions in the Middle East. The events confirmed the
government resolve to focus on energy security as the primus inter pares of Japan’s
four energy priorities.

Among the options available to the country to bolster its energy security, the Strategic
Policy Committee noted the importance of nuclear energy and the greater global
endorsement that the tech is receiving lately. At COP28 last year, for example, 22
nations including Japan pledged to triple nuclear power capacity by 2050.

25



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The meeting also noted that the government gained approval in 2023 for its two
headline decarbonization bills, namely the GX Promotion Bill and GX Decarbonization
Power Supply Bill. The Cabinet also endorsed the Strategy for promoting transition to
a decarbonized growth-oriented economic structure (July 2023).

However, there’s now a sense of urgency around creating practical guidelines for new
decarbonization technologies and sectors that are vital for projects to move from
paper into reality. At the top of METI’s agenda is streamlining the legal frameworks for
hydrogen, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and energy conservation.

Expert opinions: new ideas
During the December meeting, Strategic Policy Committee members were given the
chance to comment on the next Plan. They pointed out that the energy landscape is
changing faster than forecasted, in part to due to AI and other technology-driven
innovations, and that these changes will lead to increased power demand.

Takeda Yoko (Executive Officer at Mitsubishi Research Institute) shared a preliminary
calculation that, due to the popularization of information technology, the power
consumption of the communications industry could increase nine-fold from 2020 to
2040. Thus, METI needs to secure sufficient power supply, especially for the
semiconductor industry.

One of the underlying tenets of the current 6th Basic (Strategic) Energy Plan was that
Japan’s electricity demand will decline by 10% during this decade.


Another structural change to the Plan proposed by experts was a rethinking of the
approach that an “energy mix” is inherently a supply side issue. METI should consider
a demand-side energy mix that takes into account the increasing role in the power
systems played by solar and wind (i.e. intermittent energy sources).

Some experts warned that variable renewable energy sources are not the only ones
that face supply disruptions. Committee members Endo Noriko (Keio University
Global Research Institute) and Professor Yamaguchi Akira (School of Engineering,
University of Tokyo) pointed out that Japan has so far met its energy mix goals, but its
thermal power facilities are becoming less reliable and stable. For example, they’ve
been vulnerable to the vicissitudes of geopolitical tensions in the past two years and
this trend has to be addressed, the experts said.

Nuclear comeback
The role of nuclear energy was the topic that drew the most comments. Committee
members said that the role played by nuclear power facilities was underemphasized in
Japan. In early 2023, when eastern Japan was facing rising electricity bills due to high
fossil fuel prices, Kansai Electric in western Japan was the only utility to keep costs
relatively stable thanks to nuclear plants making up a significant part of its portfolio.

Experts worry what will happen to Japan’s nuclear assets as they age and license
terms expire over the next 15-20 years. Japan should revise the nuclear policy to
ensure continued growth of the industry as this ensures energy self-sufficiency, said
Kudo Teiko (board director of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp). Experts criticized the

government for speaking a lot about promoting nuclear energy but taking little action,
which has made it difficult for nuclear operators to make decisions.

Experts were almost unanimous in asking METI to speed up the restarts of nuclear
plants, in writing strategies to build new nuclear facilities and not waiting for new
reactor technologies to fully develop. They also asked officials to step up measures to
resolve intermediate nuclear waste storage and fuel recycling issues.

Committee member Sumi Shuzo (executive adviser of Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire
Insurance) noted that the restart of reactors to date has been exclusively in the west of
Japan. If a significant natural disaster were to occur, the nuclear gap between east
and west of the country would be exacerbated, Shuzo said.

METI responded by saying that too many thermal power stations are situated in the
Tokyo Bay area. If a severe earthquake were to hit the capital, many thermal power
plants would close. With no nuclear reactor capacity online in eastern Japan, the
region would surely face a major blackout. The volume of electricity that can be
transferred between regions, especially between eastern and western Japan where
grids run at different frequencies, is limited.

Hydrogen expectations
The panelists also presented policy ideas not directly related to the energy strategy.
Regarding hydrogen, METI officials noted that there was a limit as to what fiscal
budgets could do to spur the growth of hydrogen consumption.


Committee member Terasawa Tatsuya (Chairman and CEO of The Institute of Energy
Economics, Japan (IEEJ)) said more regulatory schemes are needed to encourage the
consumer adoption of hydrogen solutions. Government policy should focus on
promoting local hydrogen production and subsidize it to improve self sufficiency, said
Kudo.

To counter earthquake risk, Sugimoto Tatsuji (governor of Fukui Prefecture) said that
hydrogen supply bases should be built along both the Sea of Japan coast and the
Pacific coast, and be connected by pipelines.

Conclusions
The discussion by committee members is structured as a dialog, but oftentimes the
comments made by experts are a reflection of the thinking and intentions inside METI.
In this sense, it’s no surprise that nuclear power was given such detailed attention,
especially since the ministry sees it as a core tool of energy security.

However, certain aspects of nuclear operations are outside of METI’s control,
including the restart of the reactors, which depends on regulatory approval and local
and prefectural government support.

So, the routes available to the ministry include publicizing more ambitious and
detailed nuclear sector roadmaps that would seek to persuade the public and
businesses of the need to build new reactors. But how effective this approach will be
is unclear.

An area that received relatively little discussion so far was the current target to have
renewables make up 36-38% of the electricity mix by 2030. It seems that this target
remains unchanged, so METI must offer more ideas on how it will rapidly boost
renewables, which accounted for only 22% of the mix last year.

History of the Energy Plans
The Basic (Strategic) Energy Plan has a 20 year history; the first was released
in October 2003 following the enactment of the Basic Act on Energy Policy in
June 2002 that stipulated the primacy of energy security. The second
Strategic Energy Plan was issued in March 2007 and focused on promotion of
nuclear energy and the nuclear fuel cycle.

The 3rd edition of the Plan in June 2010 announced the “3Es” – Energy
Security, Environment and Economic Efficiency. After the Fukushima accident
in September 2011, the 4th edition in April 2014 called for a lower
dependance of nuclear energy. In July 2018, the 5th Plan focused on a 26%
GHG reduction by 2030 from 2016 levels, and 80% by 2050. The current
policy stipulates “2050 Carbon Neutral”.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

APAC / Renewables
Renewables capacity in Asia Pacific will grow by about 430 GW from 2023 to 2028,
which would be 73% over 2022. India will contribute about half of this growth. The
IEA expects India to install 205 GW from 2023 to 2028, doubling its 2022 installed
capacity, and becoming the third-largest market for renewables globally.

Electricity demand
Global growth in electricity demand eased to 2.2% in 2023 due to declines in
advanced economies, but it’s expected to grow henceforth. About 85% of the
increase in the world’s electricity demand is expected from China, India and Southeast
Asia. China’s power demand reached 8,000 TWh in 2022 and is expected to reach
16,800 TWh by 2050, driven by industrial growth. India’s power demand was 1,400
TWh in 2022, and will grow to 6,900 TWh by 2050, also driven by industrial growth.

India / Coal power
India reported a “remarkable growth” in coal power generation from April to
December 2023, increasing by 10.13% YoY to help meet the county’s rising energy
demand

LNG supply
By 2030, the world will have 646 mln tons of LNG supply capacity, an increase of 188
mln tons compared with 2023, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Asia
Pacific will be the destination for an estimated half of that supply as demand rises in
the region.

LNG
The U.S. paused its decision on approval for what would be the country’s largest
natural gas export terminal. The delay could stretch past the presidential election and
complicate 16 other proposed terminals. The $10 billion Calcasieu Pass 2 project
would export up to 20 mln tons of natural gas per year, increasing total U.S. gas
exports by about 20%.

Malaysia / Power grid
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) partnered with Chinese state-owned power utilities to
boost the ASEAN Power Grid with high-voltage direct current technology (HVDC),
which is crucial in enabling efficient power trading and integration of renewable
energy sources amongst the markets in the region.

Philippines / Energy conservation
An order was issued to reduce the government’s monthly consumption of electricity
and petroleum products through conservation measures. Energy audits will be
conducted to ensure compliance, alongside random energy spot-checks

Singapore / Renewables
The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) gave approval to Green Infra Wind
Energy, a subsidiary of Singaporean renewables developer Sembcorp, to build a 450
MW hybrid solar-plus-wind project in India. The power will be sold to SECI under a
25-year PPA.

Southeast Asia / Floating solar
Floating solar photovoltaics (FPV) is crucial in boosting renewables capacity in the
region, with the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand poised to lead growth. Rystad
Energy said there are around 500 MW of operational FPV projects in the region, with
around 300 MW to come online in 2023.

Southeast Asia / Russian coal
Russian coal exports to Southeast Asia surged in 2023, said analytics firm Kpler. Sri
Lanka boosted purchases by 4.5 times to 1.6 mln tons. Vietnam nearly doubled
imports to 3.9 mln tons, Malaysia, by 18% to 3.8 mln tons, and Indonesia, by 1.7 times
to 3.4 mln tons.
