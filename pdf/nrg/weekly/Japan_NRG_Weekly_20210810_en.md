NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Cost of renewables pushed up when transmission connection included: study

(Japan NRG, Aug. 3)
•  Electricity transmission connection costs could bump up solar’s total cost by 69% and wind by
26%, according to Energy Research Council working group estimates.
•  Power grid costs affect solar power more because output varies greatly depending on hours of the
day and weather conditions; but wind output is more stable.
•  The group re-assessed costs of building new power generation facilities in 2030 to take into
account the recent draft Basic Energy Plan, which calls for a drop in reliance on coal and an

expansion of renewables.
•  The latest study shows the final cost of using renewable power jumps after pricing in the expense
of modifying and operating the nation’s power transmission network. Taken into account were the
intermittency of renewables and estimates what the grid would need to do to adapt, including
reducing the run rates of thermal power plants.
•  Depending on supply and demand, renewable energy operators may still be asked to curb output,
affecting their operational efficiency, the study says.
•  The authors note actual grid costs may be higher as their calculations didn’t take into account

interconnection fees, demand response system costs, and some other factors.

Costs without transmission Total costs
network cost (Yen/kWh)  (Yen/kWh)

Solar (utility scale)        11.2                18.9

On-shore wind                14.7                18.5
Nuclear                      11.7                11.7

Gas                          10.7                10.7

Coal                         13.6                13.9

•  Without grid and systems costs, utility scale solar is forecasted to be the second cheapest energy

source after gas. With those costs, solar was expected to be the most expensive power source.
•  Japan will need to spend an additional ¥847 billion to upgrade its power transmission system if
renewables output rises by 15% or 145 tWh, the study said.
•  Also, the country needs a policy on sharing network connections and system costs.
•  Other costs factored into the study calculations were taxes, carbon associated social costs, fuel,
facility operating costs, and capital expenditure.

•  METI’s Industry Structure Council and Environment Ministry’s Central Environmental Council jointly
compiled an overview of the government’s 2030 carbon reduction programs, including those
under the oversight of other ministries.
•  The overview included all the decarbonization programs of 150 industry associations and the 68
various govt. initiatives, as well as the benchmark 2013 or 2015 carbon output levels and energy

efficiency figures, as well as the 2030 goal figures.
•  Among govt. programs, local forest ecosystems were expected to absorb 38 million tons of carbon
by 2030.
•  Joint Credit Mechanism with overseas partners was seen as a way to reduce CO2 emissions by 100
million tons by 2030.
•  The ministries also noted that a renewables and nuclear power combination would cut emissions

considerably more than if the country only employed renewables “at their maximum involvement”.
•  Various govt. programs also called for lifestyle changes such as car sharing, cutting food waste,
and replacing cars with bicycles for short-distance commutes.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI releases breakdown of renewables goals
(Nikkei, Aug. 4)
o  METI released a breakdown how it plans to achieve a 46% reduction in greenhouse gas

emissions by 2030.
o  Under the plan:
o  up to 8% of the reduction will come from the increased use of renewably-generated
electricity
o  2% will come from automobiles (with up to 70% of new vehicles being hybrids, electric
vehicles or fuel cell vehicles)
o  the rest will come from a range of policies such as those to reduce waste and

encouraging households to buy energy-efficient appliances.



Japan to launch a carbon exchange in 2022
(Japan NRG, Aug. 4)
•  In 2022 Japan plans to launch a new exchange to trade carbon credits that will be open to

participants from overseas, said METI. The exchange will trade J-Credit, Joint Credit Mechanism
(JCM) credits and high-standard voluntary credits overseas, and it will post trading levels to be
used as references for carbon pricing.
•  Separately, METI will reform the current J-Credit and JCM frameworks in a bid to expand their
usage.
•  Also, the ministry plans to set up a carbon footprint measurement framework that will employ the

latest IT tech. Design of the framework will start this year.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Proposed J-Credit reforms finalized, subject to public feedback later this year
(Japan NRG, Aug. 4)
o  METI said proposed reforms for the J-Credit carbon offset system were finalized and are
now subject to public feedback later this year before implementation.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  The proposed reforms include a renewed push to promote residential solar,
diversification of power supply sources, and the consolidation of methodologies to
assess carbon impact from various manufacturing processes. Die-casting will be added to
the manufacturing processes subject to carbon impact review.
o  To drive more interest in projects to plant forests to absorb and remove carbon, new

measuring tools on drones and helicopters will be introduced. A new mechanism to
calculate carbon on the basis of logging rates, and clarifications on certification
timeframe for bio charcoal will also be provided, METI said.



METI committee approves Basic Energy Plan, moves it to public comments

(NHK, Aug. 4)
•  METI’s deliberation committee approved the Basic Energy Plan draft, and it moves to the stage of
collecting public comments.
•  Mid-October, the final version will go before the Cabinet for approval
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Concerns over the Basic Energy Plan

(Smart Japan, Aug. 2)
o  CONTEXT: This is a commentary piece in an energy focused publication.
o  While pledging to rapidly grow solar capacity by 2030, the govt’s draft basic energy plan
fails to implement the policies necessary to make this possible. Tougher compliance
requirements on solar operators mean the cost reductions claimed by the govt. may be
difficult to achieve.
o  The existing feed-in tariff (FIT) and feed-in premium (FIP) schemes were not designed for

the kind of rapid growth that the govt. proposes. It should reform such schemes to
encourage faster uptake of solar technology.
o  While the FIT scheme created a boom in solar farms when introduced, the govt’s failure
to implement appropriate policies to support the industry has since caused many players
to leave the market. The ensuing decrease in competition caused installation costs to
rise, not fall.
o  The draft plan also focuses entirely on electricity generation. However, only around 30%

of the energy used in heating applications will be electric in 2030. The govt. should aim
to increase the use of renewable energy in non-electric heating applications.
o  Finally, the draft plan explicitly calls for a doubling of solar capacity, although considering
that the ambiguously defined “additional projected growth” target will probably also
have to come from solar, we should assume that a trebling of current capacity is required,
meaning the installation of nearly 100 GW. However, many major operators have already
left the market, and the plan doesn’t say who is going to do this work.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Govt’s unpreparedness will come back to bite it
(President Online, Aug. 4)
o  After delegates from other nations piled criticism on Japan at the COP25 conference in
2019 for failure to rein in coal-fired power plants, the MoE wanted to avoid Japan being

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

singled out for criticism at the July 23 G20 ministerial meeting on environment, climate
and energy.
o  While Japan escaped criticism at that conference, questions remain surrounding its new
draft Basic Energy Plan announced at the recent G7 summit. Many say the pledged
targets are arbitrary and unrealistic.

o  This criticism stems from the fact that the govt. arbitrated the 46% figure for total
reductions before working out how to achieve it. Indeed, the 38% figure renewables by
2030 was calculated on the basis of the 46% total, rather than from by a bottom-up
analysis of what’s possible.
o  While there’s considerable optimism over the potential of offshore wind power, wind
farm construction comes with an eight year lead time.
o  Solar farms can be built more quickly, but the solar industry is currently plagued by issues

of cowboy operators and environmental destruction.
o  The govt’s emissions pledge also failed to indicate whether aging nuclear power plants
would be replaced.
o  Even under the 2030 plan, 41% of electricity will still be generated by thermal power
stations, 19% of that from coal-fired stations. By comparison, France, the UK and
Germany have pledged to shut down all coal-fired power stations by 2022, 2024 and

2038, respectively.
o  One utility executive expressed dissatisfaction with the govt’s decision to continue to
explicitly include coal in the energy plan, and that he fears reprisals from investors and
environmental groups.



Environment Ministry allocates $6.8 billion for green commercial vehicle subsidies

(Japan NRG, July 26)
•  The MoE opened the second track of applications for low-carbon commercial vehicle subsidies for
the current fiscal year. The grants will cover up to two-thirds of electric bus or truck purchase costs,
up to half for hybrid and natural gas commercial vehicles, and up to half for charging systems.
•  Approved vehicle brands are Toyota, Hino, Mitsubishi, BYD, Alpha Bus Japan, and Asia Motor
Coach. Bus and trucking services operators and companies leasing the vehicles are eligible to

apply.
•  Subsidies are available before applicants make the purchases. The ministry is running another
program that started earlier, on April 1, to subsidize companies that have already purchased
vehicles. The total budget for the two programs allotted for this fiscal year is ¥750 billion (about
$6.8 billion).
•  Applications for both programs close on Jan. 31 2022.




First non-fossil fuel power certificate auction slated for November 19-26
(Japan NRG, Aug. 5)
•  The first non-fossil fuel power certificate auction will be held on Nov. 19-26 following a public
comment period in October, METI said.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The auction, to be held four times a year, is open to end-users for the first time, in addition to
power suppliers and brokers.
•  A recent govt. survey showed that 70% of companies are open to using the certificates to cut their
fossil-fuel power use.
•  The auction will be in a multi-price format, with a framework in place to prevent players buying

certificates beyond their actual need.



Japan to lose as many as 84,000 jobs in shift from gasoline engine to EVs
(Asia Nikkei, Aug. 7)
•  EVs have a simple construction that doesn’t require more than half of the 30,000 components that

go into a gasoline powered vehicle. This will lead to elimination of auto industry jobs.
•  Japan alone could see as many as 84,000 people lose their jobs by 2050, according to consulting
group Arthur D. Little Japan.
•  Honda Motor will close a powertrain factory north of Tokyo in 2025 as part of a pivot to EVs.
Honda offered an early retired package to staff of 55 years and older and over 2,000 people have
accepted – roughly 5% of Honda’s full-time employees.




Itochu to set up blue ammonia supply from Canada to Japan from 2026
(Nikkei, Aug. 2)
•  Itochu Corporation, the trading house, plans to begin commercial production of ammonia in
Canada in 2026 to be exported to Japan.
•  The Canadian facility, operated by the local subsidiary of Malaysian state energy firm Petronas,

could become one of the world’s largest ammonia production hubs, focused on the “blue” version
of the gas. This refers to emissions of gas captured, preventing escape into the atmosphere.
•  The $1.3 billion plant will make ammonia from natural gas extracted from a field owned by
Petronas’ subsidiary. Annual output will be 1 mln tons.
•  After a feasibility study, Itochu hopes construction could start in an Alberta industrial zone in 2023.
Itochu will set up a JV for the facility and will handle most of sales and transportation.




Land Ministry criticized over lack of support for residential solar
(EnergyShift, July, 28)
•  Administrative Reform Minister Kono Taro criticized the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport
and Tourism for not making itself accountable for the achievement of the govt’s goal of installing
an additional 7 GW of residential solar capacity by 2030.
•  At a meeting to review regulations governing renewable energy, Kono said the Ministry was not

doing enough to achieve the target of carbon neutrality by 2050, and demanded the Ministry
assume accountability for the target.

o  combat plastics issues
o  combat food waste
o  reduce CFC emissions
o  help citizens and businesses adapt to global warming.




Government to audit airports’ ‘green’ credentials
(Kankyo Business, July 30)
•  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport designated 21 airports to have their emissions
reduction initiatives audited.
•  The audits focus on CO2 emissions of airport facilities and vehicles, and will examine the viability
and economics of measures to reduce emissions.

•  The list includes major hubs: Shin-Chitose, Narita, Haneda, Chubu and Kansai.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENTS:
Keikyu airport line to be zero emission
(Kanagawa Shimbun, Aug. 2)
o  Keikyu Corporation says trains running on its airport line will be powered by renewable
electricity.

o  This will enable Keikyu to reduce annual CO2 emissions by over 4%.
o  Around 400 trains traverse the 6.5 km line joining Haneda airport to Keikyu-Kamata
station every day.

Chiyoda and Mitsubishi consider using a Netherlands port for hydrogen supply chain
(New Energy Business News, Aug 6)
•  Chiyoda Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation are conducting a feasibility study with the
Rotterdam Port Authority of the Netherlands and Tale Terminal for the potential to use the sea hub

as part of a hydrogen supply chain.
•  The partners see potential to build a hydrogen storage and transportation facility at the port, to
handle the gas in its MCH form (methylcyclohexane, which is produced from toluene and
hydrogen). Chiyoda uses the trade name, SPERA, for this technology.
•  The study, which will take a year, considers the potential for the port to handle 100,000 tons of
hydrogen in 2025, a volume that could at least triple by 2030.
•  CONTEXT: MCH is a liquid at normal temperature and pressure, making it easier to transport.

Chiyoya is also working with Brunei to test MCH in hydrogen delivery.



Liquid synthetic fuel perfect way to achieve carbon neutrality goals
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Aug. 6)
•  The govt. wants to commercialize synthetic fuel by 2040.

•  Environmentally friendly synthetic fuel has the advantage of being able to be used by the existing
vehicle fleet.
•  Future synthetic fuels will likely combine existing processes with new ones.
•  Regarding the former, ENEOS is planning to build a production scale synthetic fuel plant that will
be operational by 2030. The plant will convert CO2 into carbon monoxide via the reverse water
gas shift process to create syngas, which is then converted to liquid fuel using the Fisher Tropsch

process. Currently, the reverse water gas shift process requires temperatures of 700° and
expensive catalysts, so innovation will be required to make it more cost efficient.
•  Efforts to develop new technologies will be led by state-backed NEDO.
•  ENEOS has also partnered with Seikei University in a project to create synthetic fuel by directly
reacting CO2 and hydrogen.

Tohoku Electric to halve emissions by 2030 with ammonia and biomass
(Kankyo Business, Aug. 3)
•  Tohoku Electric said it’s committed to reducing CO2 emissions 50% by the end of the decade
versus 2013 levels.
•  To this end, the utility is trialing the co-firing of LNG at Unit 5 of its Niigata plant with hydrogen

and ammonia.
•  Tohoku is also trialing blending biomass pellets and ammonia with the coal used to fire its Noshiro
power plant, as well as conducting research into the methanation of waste CO2.
• TAKEAWAY: Tohoku and JERA are the only major Japanese power utilities so far to discuss in detail their plans
to test co-firing of ammonia or hydrogen, although this looks like a solution that most major electricity firms in
Japan will pursue. Tohoku’s schedule also looks more aggressive than that of JERA, though it is a smaller

company in terms of capacity.



Govt. to survey additional offshore wind project areas
(Yomiuri, Various, Aug. 1)
•  METI will survey three areas off the coasts of Hokkaido, Yamagata and Iwate to determine
suitability for wind farm development.
•  The 1-year survey will assess windspeed, seabed firmness, and weather conditions.

•  At present, the govt. sees fixed-bottom wind turbines as suitable for Hokkaido and Yamagata,
while floating turbines as appropriate for Iwate.
•  The assessment will also consider impact on local fisheries.
• TAKEAWAY: While the results of the tenders in the first four offshore wind areas are yet to be announced,
industry participants say many of the big players from Japan and overseas won’t win the first allocations.
However, interest in offshore wind is very high and the govt. is trying to move forward in preparing new areas

July baseload power auction price jumps by ¥3/ kWh from a year ago

(Japan NRG, Aug. 5)
•  The July 20-30 baseload power auction price settlements were up ¥3/ kWh from a year ago, METI
said. Hokkaido settled at ¥11.53/ kWh, east Japan at ¥10.92/ kWh, and west Japan at ¥9.47/kWh.
•  While the Hokkaido price was lower than its 2019 level, east and west Japan settlements were up
on previous years.
•  The settlements for all regions remained below the June average in the respective areas. Total

auction volume was 38.7 MW, down 65% YoY.
•  The next auction closes on Sept. 30.



Pacifico Energy plans to build 121 MW solar plant in Hyogo area
(New Energy Business News, Aug 5)
•  Pacifico Energy will build a 121 MW solar power plant in Sanda City, Hyogo prefecture. The plant

will be built mainly on the site of a golf course.
•  Commercial operation is scheduled to begin at the end of 2023.
•  Juwi Shizen Energy is in charge of construction.
•  Electricity sales period under the FIT system will be about 18 years.
•  Lenders for the project include Mitsubishi UFJ Bank and Mitsubishi HC Capital
•  CONTEXT: Pacifico Energy has operating capacity of 930 MW, one of Japan’s largest solar /
renewables portfolios.

• TAKEAWAY: As stated in last week’s report, the solar industry is changing and will develop larger solar power
companies than seen before. This plant’s completion will push Pacifico Energy over the 1 GW mark. It’s
interesting to note that the FIT period is 18 years, less than the 20-year duration most FIT projects have, which
suggests the operator knows it can generate a profit in less time than usual.




Osaka Gas, Mitsui and others plan to develop 400 MW offshore wind project in Akita
(New Energy Business News, Aug 6)
•  Osaka Gas, Mitsui & Co., United Project, and Northland Power Development Services Japan plan
to develop an offshore wind farm near Katagami City, Akita prefecture. The maximum capacity

would be 400 MW.

Japan Continues to Expand Coal Capacity
Despite International Pressures to Reduce Coal Reliance

A year ago, Japan’s government vowed to close three-quarters of the country’s coal-
fired power plants by 2030. Today’s situation, however, looks drastically different.
New coal capacity is being added, with more scheduled to come online in the first
half of this decade.

The new coal units are bigger than their predecessors and promise to hook up the
equivalent of almost seven nuclear reactors to Japan’s grid. Meanwhile, recent METI
edicts are asking power utilities to pause plans to scrap older thermal units due to fear
of capacity shortages.

With Japan’s coal-fired capacity set to balloon to 55.4 GW by the middle of the
decade, the country needs to make a drastic turnaround no later than 2025 if it’s to
meet 2030 decarbonization goals.

We look at the main players in coal power in Japan and what they have at risk in the
energy transition.

The big declaration
Japan had 150 coal-fired power units in July 2020 when Kajiyama Hiroshi, the Minister
of Economy, Trade and Industry, pledged to phase out all inefficient coal power
plants by 2030. Media reports at the time suggested METI wanted 114 units to retire.

A year later, the government set another numerical goal for coal in the draft of the
Sixth Basic Energy Plan. Coal-fired power is supposed to deliver 19% of Japan’s
electricity in 2030, down from the current 32%.


Since Minister Kajiyama’s big announcement, no coal station has yet to retire, or
announce firm plans to do so. On the contrary, in the past year four new coal-fired
units were brought online and two more were commissioned (and started running on
a trial basis). The operators claim these facilities showcase the best-available
technology to reduce carbon, sulfur and dust. These new units increased Japan’s coal-

fired capacity to 50.6 GW from 48 GW.

Seven more units are due to start operation in 2022-2024, which will boost capacity
further to 55.4 GW.

The new units are increasing in size, too. The six launched in the past year average a
capacity of 0.43 GW. The seven to follow average 0.69 GW.

Currently, Japan’s biggest coal-fired facilities are the two 1.05 GW units at the
Tachibana-wan thermal power station owned by J-Power in Tokushima prefecture on
Shikoku Island. Next May, however, JERA plans to bring online the 1.07 GW Taketoyo
station in Aichi prefecture.

All this runs counter to the country’s energy policy. According to the latest energy
strategy, in 2030 coal should supply 180 TWh of electricity, a sharp decline from the
326.2 TWh it provided in the fiscal year that ended March 2020.

JERA and J-Power dominate Japan’s coal power

Over half of the 150 coal-fired units are small facilities meant for in-house use by
manufacturing and trading firms, according to METI data. Some units are as tiny as 2.6
MW. In contrast, the 70 coal units operated by the 10 big power utilities, the former
regional monopolies, account for 81% of all coal-fired capacity or 39 GW.

J-Power, along with JERA, which is a JV of Tokyo Electric and Chubu Electric, are the
two biggest coal operators. They account for over half of Japan’s coal-fired capacity.

JERA ranks first with 10.3 GW. Established in 2015, the company focuses on large-
scale generation. All of its plants exceed 500 MW in capacity: It runs four 1-GW plants
and five 600-700 MW plants. Its oldest coal-fired facility is the first unit of the Hekinan
thermal station in Aichi prefecture, which went into service in 1991. Aichi is an
important center of Japan’s automobile industry, home to Toyota’s headquarters and
a significant part of domestic manufacturing capacity. Toyota has also committed to
carbon neutrality by 2050.

J-Power has 8.4 GW of capacity, and it runs 14 units at seven power stations. The
facilities are more diverse compared to JERA. Power station sizes range from two 156

J-Power has the highest coal dependency of Japanese power firms, at 47%, followed
by Okinawa Electric and Hokuriku Electric, both at 35%. The three utilities share
another unfortunate circumstance: reliance on older coal technologies such as the
sub-critical (SUB-C) and supercritical (SC) pressure systems. METI has suggested these
are categorized as “inefficient” systems, because they typically deliver less than 41%
energy efficiency. That said, efficiency levels can vary based on a power plant’s usage
(its run rate) and other conditions.

Of J-Power’s 14 coal units, 8 are SUB-C and SC systems. Their combined output is
3,512 MW, accounting for 20% of the company’s entire generation portfolio (17,725
MW). Note: these figures are for the plants wholly owned by J-Power and do not
include joint ventures.

Okinawa Electric is in an even worse predicament. All four of its coal-fired units use
SUB-C systems. The utility is also heavily dependent on coal as these stations account
for 35% of Okinawa Electric’s total output – almost twice the level of J-Power.

Hokuriku Electric has six coal units, of which two are SUB-C and one SC. The older
facilities account for 12% of its total power generation capacity.

Sustaining coal power
J-Power said its inefficient SC and SUB-C facilities will be replaced with USC or
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technologies by 2025. The company is
also active in carbon separation and capture (CCUS) space, locally and internationally.

Climate activists argue, however, that these initiatives are misguided, questioning the
rationale of putting additional resources into more coal units and CCUS, which critics
claim is unproven and many years away from even potentially making a contribution
to cutting Japanese emissions.

Since CCUS tech has yet to be fully developed, it also requires further funds to
research, build and install. That is not an option for smaller utilities like Okinawa
Electric, the revenues of which are the lowest of the regional majors in Japan. The
Okinawa company has sales that are just a quarter of J-Power’s.

The circumstances of the smaller utilities may be the reason behind the recent

| (its run rate) and other conditions. |
| Of J-Power’s 14 coal units, 8 are SUB-C and SC systems. Their combined output is |
| 3,512 MW, accounting for 20% of the company’s entire generation portfolio (17,725 |
| MW). Note: these figures are for the plants wholly owned by J-Power and do not |
| include joint ventures. |
| Okinawa Electric is in an even worse predicament. All four of its coal-fired units use |
| SUB-C systems. The utility is also heavily dependent on coal as these stations account |
| for 35% of Okinawa Electric’s total output – almost twice the level of J-Power. |
| Hokuriku Electric has six coal units, of which two are SUB-C and one SC. The older |
| facilities account for 12% of its total power generation capacity. |

| Sustaining coal power |
| J-Power said its inefficient SC and SUB-C facilities will be replaced with USC or |
| integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technologies by 2025. The company is |
| also active in carbon separation and capture (CCUS) space, locally and internationally. |
| Climate activists argue, however, that these initiatives are misguided, questioning the |
| rationale of putting additional resources into more coal units and CCUS, which critics |
| claim is unproven and many years away from even potentially making a contribution |
| to cutting Japanese emissions. |
| Since CCUS tech has yet to be fully developed, it also requires further funds to |
| research, build and install. That is not an option for smaller utilities like Okinawa |
| Electric, the revenues of which are the lowest of the regional majors in Japan. The |
| Okinawa company has sales that are just a quarter of J-Power’s. |
|  |
| The circumstances of the smaller utilities may be the reason behind the recent |

announcement by METI’s power and gas basic policy panel, which advised the
government to revisit plans to scrap old thermal generation plants, warning of
looming power shortages in the country this summer and upcoming winter.

METI said it plans to conduct a stress test / impact analysis of power plant closures on
regional electricity supplies. The ministry wants to look into the background of
closures tabled through 2024, notably the impact on power costs. In the meantime, if
some localities face challenges in securing financial resources to sustain plant
operations (due to banks being averse to lend to coal-fired power plants, for
example), the government may offer support, the METI panel said.

What this all suggests is that a small, isolated player like Okinawa Electric, whose grid
is not connected to Japan’s main island, could be given a pass and continue with
running its coal plants irrespective of the national standards. Already, METI has
allowed Okinawa Electric a waiver on the unbundling of generation, transmission and
retail that legally applies to the rest of the country, claiming the region’s small market
size made it impractical.

Should Okinawa get to keep its coal plants, the number of units that can survive in the
rest of Japan by 2030 will drop further.

Other regional power generators could appeal to METI on similar grounds, claiming
financial hardship, the need to preserve social and energy stability, and with promises
of future transformation.

All of this leaves Japan’s plans to slash coal’s share of the electricity mix by 50% within
this decade rather ambiguous and unconvincing. For sure, part of the current coal
plants will follow JERA’s lead and mix in ammonia as a fuel in the hope of switching
over entirely to the CO2-free gas in the future. That “future”, however, is currently
penciled in for 2040 or later.

Which firms will be forced to close their coal plants by 2030 is also unclear.

Japan to Open Up Power Distribution Industry to Competition

With the Introduction of a New Distribution License System

From next April, Japan will introduce a licensing system for companies that wish to run
power lines. A revision to the Electricity Business Act will allow new operators to
distribute electricity in a move that the government hopes will increase grid efficiency,
speed up a shift to a more open power market and help to decarbonize the sector.

To date, all the electricity in Japan was transmitted by subsidiaries of the country’s 10
regional power companies. From April 2022, that will change, opening up the grid to
new companies and business models.

The energy transition in power generation will now extend to power distribution.

The rationale
There are three reasons for the change, which was passed into law in June 2020. The
first is to increase the grid’s resilience to natural disaster and emergency situations.
Local grids need to become physically independent from the national transmission
network so that they can function in case of emergency and in order to prioritize
supply to local consumers.

The second goal is to encourage competition in power distribution. Aside from the 10
regional power utilities, only a few large industrial players have built and managed
power lines between their own generation assets and load centers.

The last goal is to encourage local consumption of locally produced energy, which in
turn could increase integration of renewables assets into the grid and reduce upgrade
costs.


Details of the new distribution license
There are just 34 companies in Japan currently licensed to run power from their own
generation to factories via a so-called !specific transmission and distribution license”.
Such a license requires the firms to install power lines and register all their supply
points with METI. The task is also capital-intensive, which is why only companies in the
biggest industries (such as JR East, JFE Steel, and Oji Paper) have taken the trouble to
do so.

For the rest, all distribution runs through 10 regional transmission and distribution
(T&D) firms, that once were an integral part of utilities like TEPCO, Kansai Electric, and
others. The utilities, also known as EPCos, have unbundled the T&D business in line
with the 2016 law on market deregulation. However, most of the units continue to
have a close relationship with their parent holdings.

In theory, a new distribution license is due to break up such a dynamic. It will allow
companies with less capital to enter the power distribution business. New entrants will
be able to lease existing power distribution systems from the 10 regional T&D firms.
They will also have the option to purchase or build grid systems.

New entrants will sign consignment and power balancing contracts with power
generators and retailers that were historically clients of the 10 big T&Ds. That will
make them responsible for the power distribution and balance in their service areas,
maintaining and operating infrastructure of 7,000V or less as well.

Distribution license owners will have three main tasks: 1) ensure stable and high-
quality power distribution by managing current and frequency (including in times of
disaster); 2) billing-related tasks such as meter reading and the purchase of Feed-in-
Tariff renewable power; and 3) maintain the infrastructure.

Interestingly, new power distribution companies can subcontract these services to the
10 large T&D firms, if there’s no risk of impeding fair competition. METI expects the
balancing related services and metering tasks to be subcontracted. However, all new
power distributors are required to have these technical capabilities at an early stage
and METI’s goal is for the newbies to manage these services in the long term.

As per the 2016 deregulation, distributors will be prohibited from engaging in power
generation or retail in in areas where they provide grid services. The exception to this
rule is if the number of customers in the distribution area is lower than 50,000. This
allows for more efficient management of the power needs of remote islands, for
example.

METI’s evaluation of applications for the new license will focus on the company’s long
term financial and technical capabilities, as well as its business plan and adequate
communication of its business to consumers and local governments. METI also wants
to avoid applicants that would focus only on high-profit areas.


A way to build resilience
In October 2019 a typhoon hit the Kanto region, damaging 2,000 powerline poles and
leaving 930,000 households in the dark. It took TEPCO 12 days to resolve 99% of the
blackout. In 2018, a similar event damaged 1,300 poles in the Kansai region and left
1.68 million households in the dark. It took 5 days to resolve 99% of the blackouts.

METI"s stance is that because the big T&D firms manage the grid at a macro-level,
when there’s an issue with the main transmission line, the distribution systems are
impacted. Under the new system, the ministry expects that in times of emergency the
transmission grid could be disconnected from selected distribution networks and
operate independently. In effect, it would become a microgrid. Local distribution
companies are better positioned to identify and prioritize consumers with needs for
immediate power.

In preparing for emergency situations, distributors are also more likely to consider
local generation assets. METI believes this will lead to better care for distributed
generation, which is generally smaller in capacity than the big thermal or nuclear
stations around which the EPCOs have built their business. Favoring local energy in
times of need, and in general, is also a way to lower the cost of grid upgrades to

move large volumes across big distances at a snap.

In terms, the introduction of competition and a focus on profitability in power grids
could unlock options like the value of investing in underground power lines. With new
companies entering the distribution business, METI expects T&Ds to partner with IT
companies to offer new services such as platforms for P2P trading, dynamic pricing,
and demand response. It also expects that municipalities might join the market with
technical partners to ensure the robustness of business continuity plans for
emergencies and to improve public services such as the development of EV stations.

Final Remarks
A license is unlikely to throw the sector open to hundreds of players, as we have seen
in retail. Electricity distribution is still a regulated industry that requires specialized
technical capabilities. The barrier to entry will be higher than for retail, and with
regulated wheeling charges the business case might not even be obvious for new
entrants.

Still, this new system is a step forward in developing local networks in which
decentralized generation and demand can meet around a microgrid model. It is,
however, unclear at this stage as to why this license system would promote a more
efficient distribution network than one managed by the 10 big T&Ds, especially when
considering the resources and technical knowledge necessary for its operation and
maintenance.

Perhaps one part of METI"s agenda is to further define the unbundling of the big
regional power utilities, which have on occasion leaned on their T&D units to prop up
other parts of the holding, thus casting doubt on the business separation. Any
competition, no matter how small, could foster a different dynamic in the distribution
sector and make it more likely to act independently.

It would be curious to see if new business models and investments in local grids also
follow. For now, there seems to be a gap between METI’s aspirations for the new
system and actual moves by new companies to enter the business. The next eight
months will show us if the grid system too is ready for an energy transition.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Tidal Power:
A tidal-powered turbine, one of the world’s most powerful, has started to generate
electricity on the grid in Scotland. The 680-tonne Orbital O2 turbine can power 2,000
homes for 15 years; it was assembled over 18 months and is now anchored off the
Orkney Islands in North East Scotland where a subsea cable connects the 2MW unit to
the local onshore electricity network. This is Orbital Marine Power’s first commercial
turbine and the company hopes to develop it globally. The turbine also provides
power to an onshore electrolyzer to generate green hydrogen.

Coal:
1). According to the EIA, U.S. reliance on coal powered electricity is now expected to
be 26% of the electricity mix in 2021, up 4 percentage points vs. 2020. Germany’s
emissions from coal- power plants also increased 36% YoY in H1 2021, due partly to
falling output from wind energy.
2). A plan by the Asian Development Bank will enable governments and coal power
investors to put coal assets in public-private partnerships that would be wound down
over a 15-year period. The final plan will be unveiled at COP26. The president of
COP26 has stated that he would like to “consign coal to history” during the event in
November. Japanese and South Korean lenders are also reducing coal commitments.
3). Meanwhile, coal prices in South Africa, Europe, and Australia are hitting record
highs as demand in China and other geographies surges.

Oil & Gas:
1). BP announced a $1.4 billion share buyback after better-than-expected Q2 results
due to higher oil prices, and will also raise its dividend by 4%.
2). U.S. natural gas prices continue to hit record highs with Henry Hub at $4.10 mmbtu
on Friday, up 40% since April, and up 100% YoY.
3). Oil prices, however, declined sharply, with Brent and WTI down $5 a barrel due to
concerns over the global pandemic. Brent closed Friday @ $71 and WTI @ $68.

EVs:
The U.S. EV truck maker, Nikola, is scaling back sales forecasts for 2021 due to supply
chain issues for semi-conductors.

Nuclear Power:
1). Romania and Canada agreed to strengthen cooperation in nuclear energy enabling
the completion, refurbishment and possible expansion of the Cernavoda nuclear
power plant, east of Bucharest, which produces 20% of Romania’s electricity. The
signing of a MoY in Bucharest follows similar agreements with the U.S. and France.
The Cernavoda plant uses Canada’s Candu heavy water nuclear technology.
2). In the U.S., Talen Energy Corporation announced a JV with U.S.-based bitcoin
mining company, TeraWulf, to develop 300 MW of zero-carbon bitcoin mining
capacity. Talen's Susquehanna nuclear plant will power the Nautilus Cryptomine.
3). Struggling nuclear power reactors in the U.S. are slated to receive $6 billion of
support under the infrastructure bill currently in the U.S. Senate. A program to
25

evaluate nuclear reactors at risk of shutdown will be created within the Department of
Energy under terms of the $550 billion infrastructure package.
4). Several U.S. utilities, such as Energy Northwest, Utah Associated Municipal Power
Systems, and PacifiCorp, are entering partnerships to build small modular reactors as
demand for carbon-free, 24-hour power grows.

Shipping:
A record 10 tankers crossed the Northern Sea Route in July to deliver Yamal LNG to
Asian buyers vs. seven vessels in July 2020, by-passing the longer Suez route.

Aviation:
Boeing recently estimated that a single aircraft emits more than one million tons of
CO2 over 20 years of use, which is equivalent to having 10,000 cars on the road.

COP26:
China and India are among several countries that missed the U.N. deadline for
submitting proposed national cuts to greenhouse gas emissions for a COP26 report
for governments attending the Glasgow conference. The IPCC is expected to issue a
ground-breaking report on global temperature increases this week.

Wildfires:
The Kemerkoy coal power plant in the south-west province of Mugla, Turkey was
spared as 55,000 hectares burned and 36,000 people were evacuated in one of the
worst wildfires in Turkish history. The plant close to the Mediterranean is a 630 MW
facility owned by Limak Holdings, the Turkish infrastructure conglomerate. Other
recent wildfires that pose risk to power infrastructure include Yakutsk, Russia; Bootleg,
Oregon; California; British Colombia, Canada; Athens, Greece (81 wildfires); Albania;
and Sardinia, Italy. Forest destruction also reduces the potential for carbon offsets.

Energy/Climate Data:
1). News Corp. (owner of the Wall Street Journal) will buy IHS Markit’s oil, coal, metals
and mining, and petrochemicals price information services for $1 billion following
S&P’s acquisition of IHS Markit last year. Regulatory approval for the S&P/IHS $40+
billion merger was contingent on the sale of certain assets.
2). Moody’s will acquire RMS, a UK-based catastrophe and risk management firm, for
$2 billion as it acquires climate-change data to better service insurance clients.

Rail:
France’s Thales Group will sell its railway signaling business to Hitachi for $2 billion.

Hydrogen:
France’s EDF is looking to produce hydrogen (‘pink hydrogen’) at the $28 billion
Sizewell C nuclear power plant currently under construction on the UK’s southeast
coast. The plant could produce 14% of the UK’s hydrogen requirements.

China:
China could face larger crude-steel output cuts as it attempts to reduce emissions in
key sectors, according to China’s Iron & Steel Association.

Australia:
1). Oil Search has recommended a buyout offer from Santos worth $6.2 billion in a
deal that will create a top-20 global oil and gas company based in Oceania. Santos is

Australia’s second largest gas producer, and Oil Search is the largest oil and gas
exploration company in Papua New Guinea. The combined company will have assets
in Australia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and North America with a market
capitalization of $16 billion, placing the merged entity in the top-20 ASX-listed
companies and the 20 largest global oil and gas companies. The new company will
have a combined 2021 production of 116 million barrels of oil equivalent, and will
have a combined resource base of 4,983 million barrels of oil equivalent.
2). A fire last week at the 450 MW Victorian Big (lithium ion) Battery Project, which
uses the Tesla Megapack, took three days to extinguish. The project is managed by
Neoen, the French renewable energy developer.

India:
1). According to a recent IEA report, India is set to see the largest increase in energy
demand of any country over next 20 years. India’s energy future will depend on
buildings and factories yet to be built, and vehicles and appliances yet to be bought.
Based on India’s current policy, nearly 60% of its CO2 emissions in the late 2030s will
come from infrastructure and machines that don’t exist today. India’s energy
transformations – on a scale no country has achieved in history – will require huge
advances, strong partnerships and vast capital. The additional funding for clean
energy tech required to put India on a sustainable path over the next 20 years may be
$1.4 trillion.
India faces a range of evolving energy security challenges. India’s combined import
bill for fossil fuels is projected to triple over the next two decades, with oil by far the
largest component. Domestic production of oil and gas continues to fall behind
consumption trends and net dependence on imported oil rises above 90% by 2040,
up from 75% today. This continued reliance on imported fuels creates vulnerabilities
to price cycles and volatility, as well as possible disruptions to supply. Energy security
hazards could arise in India’s domestic market as well, notably in the electricity sector
in the absence of significant increases in system flexibility, improvements to the
financial health of many electricity distribution companies, and other reform efforts.
2). India may have a reached a $1 billion tax refund settlement with the UK’s Cairn
Energy after India’s lower house of parliament approved a draft law that cancels
retrospective tax on foreign investments. Cairn had threatened to appropriate
offshore Indian state assets unless a refund was received.

Russia:
Russia is planning to subsidize the purchase of domestically manufactured EVs up to
$8,500 per vehicle and plans to produce 220,00 EVs annually by 2030. Russia is
planning to cut emissions 70% vs. 1990 levels by 2030.

Spain:
Spain is calling on the EU to implement a price ceiling for electricity prices as
consumer tariffs hit record highs with Spanish retail power charges at E10 cents/kWh.
Higher power prices have become a big domestic political issue in Spain. Spain relies
heavily on imported LNG, the prices of which are currently soaring.

U.S.:
1). President Biden signed an executive order on Friday that calls for 50% of all U.S.
automobile sales to be EVs by 2030. GM, Ford, and Stellantis are thought to have
signed up to this commitment. The required electrification investment for the U.S.
auto industry is thought to be $330 billion over the next five years.
2). Exxon is considering a net-zero CO2 scope 1 and scope 2 commitment by 2050.
