NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


Idemitsu Kosan appoints new president

(Nikkei, Feb 12)
•  Idemitsu Kosan said that executive Vice President Sakai Noriaki will replace Kito Shunichi as
president on April 1, the first leadership change since 2018.
•  The decision follows the merger of Idemitsu Kosan with Showa Shell. The new leadership will
formulate the mid-term plan for FY2025.
•  Sakai held roles in petroleum product sales, and finance, becoming CFO in 2020.
•  CONTEXT: Kito became President in 2018 and led the merger with Showa Shell, and also brought the
company into the SAF market and restructured its business portfolio. Since 2022, he has also served as
head of the Petroleum Association of Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: Mid-February is a popular time for big companies in Japan to announce leadership changes. It
does not usually indicate a change in strategy or direction, as it may with European or American firms. For
Idemitsu, the new president will need to decide the extent to which the company will pursue new energy
alternatives, such as ammonia fuel and SAF compared with the group’s bedrock oil refining business. Unlike
domestic peers ENEOS and Cosmo, Idemitsu has relatively little exposure to the renewable energy sector
outside of a 400 MW solar portfolio in the U.S. The new president may want to decide whether the company
should embrace renewables at scale or exit the sector.



JGC taps new president
(Nikkei, Feb 12)
•  JGC said Chairman and CEO Sato Masayuki will take over as president on April 1. Current
President and COO Ishizuka Tadashi will step down from all executive positions, including as a
board director.
•  The company reported a ¥7.8 billion loss in FY2023 due to project delays in Saudi Arabia’s oil and
gas sector. In FY2024, the firm is also expected to have fallen into the red over problems with
projects in Taiwan, the Middle East, and Canada.

•  Sato served as CFO and was promoted to chairman in 2014. By assuming the presidency, Sato aims
to balance business expansion with financial soundness.
•  CONTEXT: Ishizuka is stepping down amid JGC’s recent poor performance. JGC said for FY2024 it will
have a ¥40 billion loss due to financial difficulties faced by a Middle Eastern subcontractor, which is a
downward revision of ¥27 billion from a previous forecast.



Itochu Enex acquires stake in ENECHANGE
(Company statement, Feb 3)
•  Itochu Enex inked a capital and business alliance with ENECHANGE by taking a 17.45% voting
rights stake, to become the company's largest shareholder.
•  The partnership will focus on acquiring new users by leveraging each company's customer base and
product offerings, co-developing and selling core retail systems for electricity, gas, and mobility.
•  The firms will also jointly undertake business operations for retail service providers, co-develop
energy consulting systems, and expand the EV charging service business.
•  CONTEXT: ENECHANGE is spinning off its EV charging business, with a 51% investment from Chubu
Electric.

Tohoku Electric and NYK trial coal transport vessel using biodiesel
(Company statement, Feb 10)
•  Tohoku Electric, in collaboration with NYK Line, made a trial voyage using biodiesel fuel on a coal
transport vessel, Noshiro Maru.
•  The ship was refueled with biodiesel in the Keihin area on Feb 9, and departed the same day.
•  CONTEXT: Launched in 1993 as Tohoku Electric’s first dedicated coal transport vessel, Noshiro Maru is
the first owned by a utility to run on biodiesel, which is carbon-neutral because the CO2 emitted during
combustion is offset by the CO2 absorbed by plants used as raw material.
•  CONTEXT: Biodiesel can be used in heavy oil-fired marine engines and is seen as an effective means of
reducing GHG emissions during the transition period from heavy oil to zero-emission fuels. MLIT
supports the use of biofuels on existing ships. In March 2023, it published the "Guidelines for Handling
Biofuels on Ships," which was revised in March 2024.

• TAKEAWAY: Biofuels for automobiles have been researched, developed and promoted for more than 20 years,
but they are not widely used. In recent years, however, SAF, a biofuel for aircraft, has attracted attention, and
the use of biofuel for ships is beginning to be promoted. As R&D of hydrogen and ammonia as next-gen
shipping fuels is also underway, the attention to biofuel has been lower. However, Japan’s government has
shown more interest in biofuel options in the last year, considering it a more cost-effective option.


NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


EEX sees record surge in Japan’s electricity futures trading amid gas price concerns

(Nikkei, Feb 12)
•  On Feb 10, the EEX recorded a historic high in electricity futures trading, reaching about 2 TWh on
the day, more than double the previous record of 0.9 TWh set on Sept 20, 2024.
•  Trading volume was 2.4 times the 0.8 TWh of spot transactions on JEPX that day, driven by strong
activity in seasonal contracts for summer and winter 2025.

NEWS:    HYDROGEN



Toyota creates a third-generation fuel cell, offers 20% longer cruising range
(Company statement, Feb 14)
•  Toyota’s new FC system offers double the durability of previous models, comparable to diesel
engines, with a 20% longer cruising range and 1.2x improved fuel efficiency.
•  This is achieved through advanced cell design and streamlined manufacturing processes, making
hydrogen vehicles more affordable.
•  Toyota will launch its FC in Japan, EU, North America, and China in 2026.
• TAKEAWAY: Toyota was the original driver of Japan’s hydrogen push in the mid 2010s, but it has since been
less vocal on hydrogen-based mobility, preferring to showcase its R&D of multiple engine / motor technologies
as a way of hedging the bets on future demand. With EVs already strongly positioned in China, Europe and
parts of the U.S., it will be difficult for Toyota to win support for FC mobility with the low availability of
refueling infrastructure. Still, the R&D may not be in vain if the FC systems are able to replace diesel in trucks
and other large vehicle segments.

NEWS:    NUCLEAR      ENERGY



KEPCO to build a data center powered by Mihama NPP
(Company statement, Feb 10)
•  Optage, a telecom subsidiary of KEPCO, plans to build a data center for generative AI in Mihama,
Fukui Pref, near Mihama NPP.
•  The facility launches in FY2026 and will be powered by electricity from the NPP.
•  The plan involves installing high-performance GPU-equipped servers inside containers. They will
lease them to companies developing generative AI. Each container can hold up to 32 servers.
•  According to Optage, this will be the first instance when KEPCO built a container-based data center
for generative AI.
• TAKEAWAY: Securing nuclear energy to power data centers has already started in the U.S. and a number of
data center operators expressed interest in similar transactions in Japan. This KEPCO arrangement may be
among the first of its kind in Japan, but it is also notable that the Kansai utility is both the power provider and
(via a subsidiary) the client. Whether EPCOs will open these opportunities to non-related parties will be a
development worth monitoring.



Kyushu Electric to restart pluthermal power generation

(Company statement, Feb 14)
•  Kyushu Electric said it will restart pluthermal power generation, the use of mixed uranium-
plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel, from the Rokkasho facility.
•  However, the utility changed the expected start date from FY2027 to at least FY2029 or later.
•  The MOX fuel will be refined in France.
•  CONTEXT: MOX is the result of mixing uranium and plutonium extracted from spent nuclear fuel.
Kyushu Electric began pluthermal power generation at Unit 3 of Genkai NPP in 2009. The company
had been using MOX refined in France while waiting for the completion of the Rokkasho facility. The
utility suspended pluthermal power generation in November 2023.
•  CONTEXT: Kyushu Electric has plutonium stock stored in the UK. In April 2024, the company
conducted a book transfer with Tohoku Electric and other companies. It then consolidated its entire
overseas plutonium stock in France.
• TAKEAWAY: The Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan (FEPC) announced that 3.3 tons of
plutonium will be consumed as MOX fuel by FY2029, possibly increasing that to 6.6 tons annually by FY2030 to
reduce plutonium stockpiles. The usage plans for FY2027 and FY2028 have been revised down due to delays in
operations of relevant facilities in France. Major power companies are forecast to hold 40 tons of plutonium by
the end of FY2024. Kyushu Electric, Shikoku Electric, KEPCO, and (in the future) Chugoku Electric, are able to
use MOX fuel.



KEPCO to increase volume of MOX sent to France

(Company statement, Feb 12)
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan will increase the amount of spent fuel sent to
France for use in a processing study to enhance effectiveness.


10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Under the revised plan, the total amount will double to 400 tons, consisting of 20 tons of spent
MOX fuel and 380 tons of spent uranium fuel. The original plan was to transport 200 tons of spent
fuel from KEPCO, including 10 tons of spent MOX and 190 tons of spent uranium.
•  Orano, a French nuclear fuel cycle company, will hold reprocessing demos.
•  CONTEXT: The study’s goal is to set up a viable reprocessing technology for spent MOX fuel. A key goal
is to prove its feasibility in commercial reprocessing plants.
• TAKEAWAY: Behind this decision looms the delay in completion of Japan Nuclear Fuel's Rokkasho facility.
KEPCO's spent nuclear fuel management plan entailed sending part of it to Rokkasho for reprocessing. But, its
launch was again postponed, from FY2026 to FY2028.



Fukushima NPP begins dismantling empty treated water storage tanks
(NHK, Feb 14)
•  TEPCO began dismantling some of the treated water storage tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP.
This is the first time since the discharge of treated water began about 18 months ago.
•  Over 1,000 tanks store treated water containing tritium and other radioactive substances, even after
processing. Since August 2022, TEPCO has been releasing the diluted treated water into the ocean.

•  With some tanks now empty due to the ongoing discharge, TEPCO has started dismantling them.
The tanks are 9 meters in diameter and 12 meters high.
•  CONTEXT: Since August 2023, TEPCO has discharged 78,285 tons of treated water, but contaminated
water continues to accumulate at a rate of 80 tons per day due to groundwater and rain infiltration.
TEPCO seeks to reduce this to 50-70 tons per day by FY2028, but exactly how remains unclear.
• TAKEAWAY: Late last year, TEPCO retrieved only 0.7 grams of debris from Unit 2, a fact that underscores the
technical hurdles. Without large-scale debris removal, reducing contaminated water remains difficult. It
perpetuates reliance on storage tanks even as treated water is discharged.

ANALYSIS

BY JOHN VAROLI
Will Trump Unleash a Golden Era of U.S. - Japanese Energy Relations?

The recent summit between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba
has been widely hailed as a turning point in Japanese-American relations, particularly
in energy. The new White House is keen to maximize profit from the nation's abundant
hydrocarbon resources, making energy a top priority.
Ishiba's approach is to align closely with the administration while safeguarding Japan’s
interests where they diverge from Washington’s. Yet, given the White House’s
aggressive stance, Ishiba may find it difficult to push back when disagreements arise.

Japan, shaped by postwar American influence and host to a significant U.S. military
presence, is deeply intertwined with Washington’s defense and trade policies. This
dependency makes Tokyo eager to maintain smooth ties, especially as Trump revives
economic grievances, including the longstanding trade deficit. While today’s $68 billion
gap is far lower than its inflation-adjusted peak in 1985 (which would be $135 billion in
today’s money), Trump remains determined to shrink it further.

To appease Washington, Ishiba has pledged greater investment in the U.S., particularly
in LNG and steel. Japan has led net foreign direct investment in the U.S. for five
consecutive years, hitting a record ¥11.73 trillion ($77 billion) last year. However,
Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum could complicate matters, though Japan has
mechanisms like Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) to mitigate risks.
Despite these percolating tensions, Washington and Tokyo are likely to find that
collaboration in the energy sector will be the easiest way to reinforce their nearly 80-
year alliance, which is a linchpin for security across Asia-Pacific. Continued cooperation
and commerce in LNG, nuclear power, renewable energy, and hydrogen technologies
will remain a priority in coming years. Here’s a brief overview.

LNG
Japan is the world's second largest LNG importer, and the U.S. has been a key supplier
since the U.S.-Japan Energy Partnership was established in 2017 during Trump’s first
term. This helped Japan to diversify its energy sources and reduce dependence on
Middle Eastern and Russian supplies.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp
(SMBC) are the biggest financiers of LNG export projects in the U.S. having each
allocated anywhere between $10.7 billion and $13.8 billion since 2012.

Japanese companies are also key investors in major LNG projects, including JERA,
Japan's largest power generation company, with its 25.7% stake in Freeport LNG
(Texas). Mitsui & Co and Japan LNG Investment LLC, which is jointly owned by
Mitsubishi Corp and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK), have a stake in Cameron
LNG (Louisiana).
In 2023, Japan imported 5.5 million metric tons of American LNG — only 8% of total
purchases, but 34% more than in 2022. In 2024, Japan's imports of American LNG rose
15%, and Ishiba has promised to push the numbers even higher. JERA already has a
deal lined up to buy 1 million tons of fuel per year from Calcasieu Pass 2, a planned
export terminal in Louisiana that was hit by Biden’s export permit freeze.

However, one of the most ambitious new U.S LNG projects will be closer to the Arctic
Circle. Trump is keen on exporting LNG from Alaska, and he wants Japan to join a $44
billion joint venture that will produce natural gas in the North Slope region,
transporting it via a 1,300-kilometer pipeline to the Nikiski LNG terminal in southern
Alaska.
If built, the Nikiski LNG terminal will include facilities to liquefy 20 million tons of
natural gas annually and a marine terminal for loading LNG onto ships. Shipments are
expected to begin between 2031 and 2032.

This project, if realized, would offer Japan a geographically closer and logistically
simpler supply, bypassing the congested Panama Canal.

Trump's executive order prioritizing energy development in Alaska was one of the first
he signed upon entering the Oval Office. That executive order mentions "Asia-Pacific
allies" as markets for the U.S.-produced LNG, which, according to Ken Koyama, chief
researcher at Japan’s Institute of Energy Economics, is a clear sign that sales to the
region will be the way that the two allies seek to even out the trade deficit.
The Alaskan project, however, is most likely to be marred by controversy and litigation.
Much of the state’s reserves are in federally protected lands, and if the Democrats return
to the White House in 2029, then the new president could easily cancel it.

Japan’s domestic LNG demand is not expected to increase in the coming years. So why
would Japan boost exports of a fuel that it doesn’t need more of? Japanese traders seek
to become dominant players reselling LNG in Asia, where demand is expected to
increase over the next 20 years. The U.S. and Japan could work together on building up
the Southeast Asia markets for LNG, according to Koyama, also countering China’s
regional influence.
Nuclear Energy
Nuclear power generation is another sector where Japan and the U.S. have been
collaborating for years, but only since the energy crisis of 2022 has the energy source
made a comeback among both policymakers and the general public.

Today, Japan, the U.S. and most industrialized nations are forging ahead with
ambitious plans to build nuclear capacity, both as new reactors and through
modernization of existing units. For example, Westinghouse and NuScale are working
with Japanese partners to advance small modular reactors (SMRs), which, if built, could
provide power to remote and underserviced areas.

Fusion energy research is also a sector where there’s potential for Japanese and
American cooperation. In April 2024, PM Kishida and President Biden signed an
agreement to accelerate the two countries’ decades-long cooperation in fusion. The goal
is to develop complementarity between U.S. and Japanese resources and facilities,
including those in universities, national laboratories and private companies. The two
countries are also both participants in the ITER multinational fusion project.
Finally, the Japan-U.S. Strategic Energy Partnership, launched in late 2017, supports
nuclear decommissioning and reactor safety. Last year, Japan and the U.S. agreed on
the Fukushima Daiichi Decommissioning partnership with TEPCO and U.S. national
laboratories to deepen joint research for decommissioning the destroyed facility,
especially in fuel debris retrieval.

Hydrogen collaboration
Japan and the U.S. are expected to continue developing a global hydrogen supply chain,
as well as increasing investments in hydrogen-powered electricity.
In January 2024, ENEOS took a stake in MVCE Gulf Coast's low-carbon hydrogen and
ammonia project which will produce low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia, with plans to
export these products to Japan to support its decarbonization efforts.

In March 2024, JERA Americas inked a partnership with ExxonMobil to explore the
development of a large-scale ‘blue’ hydrogen and ammonia production project at the oil
company’s Baytown Complex near Houston, Texas. That facility is expected to produce
about 900,000 metric tons of blue hydrogen annually, with operations slated to begin in
2028. JERA might purchase about 500,000 tons of low-carbon ammonia annually for
use in Japan.

Late in 2024, Mitsubishi Corp announced its plan to take a stake in the Baytown facility
and to partner with Idemitsu Kosan to offtake the low-carbon ammonia for use in
Japan's power generation and industrial sectors.
Later this year, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Chevron seek to start producing
green hydrogen in the State of Utah using renewable energy. Their joint venture, ACES
Delta, will produce and store the hydrogen in salt caverns. An 840 MW power plant will
be built to run on a blend of 70% natural gas and 30% hydrogen, fully transitioning to
hydrogen by 2045.

Finally, JERA Americas is working with American partners to introduce hydrogen co-
firing at its natural gas-fired power plants in the U.S. Northeast with a total power
generation capacity of about 4 GW.

Conclusions
For the next four years, Trump’s mantra of "drill, baby, drill" will reshape U.S.-Japan
energy ties. Increased output may enhance energy security and lower prices, but it also
complicates climate goals for 2030 and 2050. Unlike under Biden, the alliance is no
longer focused solely on a low-carbon transition; instead, geopolitical priorities and
trade balance concerns are driving policy.
Japan’s real response remains uncertain. METI will closely monitor U.S. energy strategy
shifts, while also watching how major American IT firms – previously vocal on green
energy – adjust to Trump’s agenda. With global markets in flux, Tokyo may adopt a
cautious stance, waiting to see if the next Democratic administration reverses course
once again.

Pumped Hydro: The Emerging Backbone of Japan’s Energy Transition

Pumped storage hydropower, a late 19th century technology that was largely ignored
by the markets for decades, is now emerging as pivotal to bringing balance and stability
to Japan's grid as the nation both reboots nuclear energy and moves to rely more on
solar and wind generation.
Japan currently has three major pumped hydro projects in various stages of completion,
including one serving Tokyo that will have the world’s third-largest pumped-storage
power capacity when fully online. Utilities are also making investments in existing
plants so they are more responsive to contemporary energy needs.

Japan already has the world’s second largest pumped hydro generating capacity and by
far the largest per capita. In many countries, such as the U.S. which hasn’t developed a
major pumped hydro plant since the 1990s, a lack of new, suitable sites has slowed or
halted the expansion of this kind of energy storage over recent decades.

With reactors now coming back online and variable renewable energy (VREs)
expanding, the once predictable recharge timetables for pumped hydro are becoming
chaotic. Japan NRG looks at how pumped hydro capacity, a relatively simple energy
storage method, is being developed, deployed and traded in new ways to meet Japan’s
21st century energy needs.
Three current pumped hydro projects
Japan’s countrywide, mountainous topography makes it relatively easy to find
unexploited locations for upper reservoirs sufficiently elevated above existing water
sources, making the continued development of pumped hydro an attractive energy
storage option.

In the latter half of the 20th century, pumped hydro plants in Japan were largely
nuclear-powered and strategically built between reactors and their electricity end-users.
They were pumped, or “charged,” at night when electricity demand was lowest. After
the wave of reactor shutdowns in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident, pumped
hydro plants were increasingly charged during the day instead, soaking up excess
energy from rapidly proliferating solar installations.
Of Japan’s three major pumped hydro projects under development, two serve the Tokyo
area under TEPCO. They will add to the 5.53 GW of pumped hydro capacity that the
Tokyo-based utility built from the mid 1960s through 1995.

The worldwide pumped hydro industry’s rule of thumb is that a plant’s upper reservoir
should have a hydraulic head, or elevation, that’s 200 meters above the lower reservoir
so as to provide sufficient energy upon discharge. The two ongoing TEPCO projects
vastly exceed this. Kannagawa Hydropower Plant, now one-third online and to have the
world’s third largest pumped storage generation capacity of 2.82 GW when fully
operational after 2032, has a hydraulic head of 653 meters, comfortably higher than the
634 meter Tokyo Skytree broadcasting tower.
The other TEPCO project is the 75% operational Kazunogawa Hydroelectric Power
Station, with a hydraulic head of 714 meters. It will have 1.6 GW of capacity when
completed.

Japan’s final under-construction pumped hydro project is Hokkaido's Kyogoku Power
Plant, the northern island’s first pure pumped-storage facility (meaning, not tied to an
existing hydropower dam). Its hydraulic head is less dramatic but still an impressive
369 meters that will produce 600 MW when its last unit begins operation in 2033.
Doubling down on charging
In 2019, researchers at the Tokyo-based Renewable Energy Institute (REI) looked into
how pumped hydro was being utilized in Japan to deal with VRE. The energy scene at
the time was rather novel: the nuclear reactors were still largely shut down from their
almost complete grounding in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, while
increasing amounts of solar energy under the FIT system was entering the grid.
The study looked at three of the nine balancing areas, or Transmission Service
Operators (TSOs) in Japan: Kyushu, which had high VRE penetration and several
reactors restarted; Kansai, which had low VRE but more reactors online; and, Chubu
where nuclear plants were still offline.
Looking at days in 2018 when pumped hydro operations were the highest in each area,
in Kyushu and Chubu pumped hydro was charged during the day when there was
excess solar entering the grid; whereas plants in Kansai, with more nuclear power
online, followed the traditional pattern of being charged at night.
REI continued to track pumped hydro charging times across all of mainland Japan.
Researcher Kimura Seiichiro, one of the authors of the 2019 report, said that with VRE
proliferating and nuclear energy rebooting, he sees pumped hydro having two recharge
timetables – once during the day and once at night, although this is still a new and
relatively rare occurrence.
Considering Japan’s renewed enthusiasm for nuclear energy and the goal of attaining
45 GW of wind power by 2040, Kimura predicts this will become standard in the near
future.
Pumped hydro underpins new energy exchange
In January 2024, Japan held its first ever long-term decarbonized power source (LTDA)
capacity auction. Of the 42 winners, three were pumped hydro projects which
collectively were awarded contracts for 577 MW. The lion’s share went to Japan’s
largest plant in the sector, KEPCO’s 1.9 GW Okutataragi Pumped Storage station, to
update two of its 254 MW units from fixed to adjustable speed. This is a technology

developed in 1990s Japan and it will enlarge the plant’s Load Frequency Control in
preparation for VRE integration.

KEPCO’s upgrade project can be seen as part of a recent, larger trend across Japan’s
energy grid to make it more nimble to market demands and supply fluctuations. In
2015, this began with the establishment of the private entity Organisation for Cross-
regional Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO) to co-ordinate power supply
and demand nationwide and help develop infrastructure for cross-area transmission.
OCCTO and METI then worked with Japan’s nine mainland TSOs to develop a
balancing market that could mitigate VRE.
In 2021, these efforts matured with the establishment of the “Supply and Demand
Coordination Market” (also known as the balancing market) that was affixed to the
newly created Electric Power Reserve eXchange (EPRX). It allows each TSO to display
the amount of adjustment power it wants to procure, (i.e. last-minute gaps between
available supply and the demand), so that generators can offer bids.
Since its 2021 beginning, the EPRX market expanded incrementally, until FY2024 when
trading began for all product categories, from primary to tertiary adjustment capacities.
At that point, pumped hydro emerged as the main contract resource in the Tokyo,
Chubu and Hokkaido areas.

As of June 2024, EPRX had 84 trading partners, including the TSOs and their
subsidiaries, large firms like Nippon Steel and Itochu, as well as new local power firms
and battery manufacturers.

Pumped hydro versus BESS
While Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) assets have yet to make a big impact on
the EPRX market, they were the biggest winners of the initial LTDA round last year, in
terms of the number of awards. Thirty projects were awarded subsidies to cover 4.56
GW of battery capacity.
As BESS efficiency has gone up and prices per kilowatt-hour have come down, it has
become competitive with pumped hydro. The latter requires high startup costs,
effectively blocking anyone outside of large utilities from developing it. Once up and
running, however, pumped hydro stations can continue for half a century or more with
minimal maintenance. One of TEPCO’s existing stations came online in 1965.

But many factors still make Japan’s existing 27.5 GW of pumped hydro generating
capacity — which will be roughly 30 GW by the end of 2033 — attractive compared to
modern battery storage. The main resources needed to develop pumped hydro are
concrete and steel, both of which are domestically produced and don't experience the
same price volatility as rare metals like lithium and cobalt, let alone the geopolitical
concerns around sourcing.
Once constructed, pumped hydro plants have minimal maintenance requirements and
very long lifespans, usually defined as 50-60 years or more. Although modern BESS are
often nearly 90% efficient upon launch of operation compared to pumped hydro’s
roughly 80% efficiency, they degrade annually and are typically significantly weaker
after a decade.

Then there’s disposal. With the very recent proliferation of BESS, Japan has yet to see
significant quantities of used batteries enter the waste stream, but when the first
generation of these systems is retired it’s a safe bet there’ll be significant recycling and
disposal challenges.

Topography and the future of pumped hydro
Japan’s topography is so well suited to pumped hydro that a 2022 report from the
Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) proposed the development of small-scale
pumped hydro plants powered by renewables across the country, creating a distributed
storage system to match DEPs with the added benefit of being local buttresses against
flooding.
In looking at the roughly 2,700 existing multipurpose dams across the country, the
report identified nearly 1,000 suitable sites, meaning areas where a small upper
reservoir of 100 meters in diameter could be constructed at least 200 meters above the
lower reservoir made by the dam.

JST went on to predict that such distributed pumped hydro plants could have a storage
capacity of 180 to 420 TWh per year. Skeptics doubt that all the locations listed by JST
would actually make commercial sense, with the economic strength of pumped hydro
traditionally in large-scale facilities. Regardless, it is clear that Japan has not yet
exhausted its pumped hydro potential.
Considering current sharp upticks in energy demand from data centers and how the
recently-released draft of the Seventh Basic Energy Plan calls for nuclear and
renewables to make up 60-70% of the country’s power by 2040, Japan’s energy future
will remain anchored by this 19th century technology.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Renewables
The Clean Energy Council said that 2024 was the best year for large-scale renewable
energy investment in the country since 2018, with AU$9 billion in total capital
committed. In Q4 2024 commitments were made to seven new large-scale renewable
energy projects, for 1.6 GW of generation capacity and AU$2.4 billion of capital
investment.
Battery storage
More long-duration energy storage systems, those with capacities exceeding eight
hours, will be installed this year, reported Top Cleantech Trends published by S&P
Global Commodity Insights. Installations are anticipated to more than double over
2024.
China / Renewables
The expansion of renewable energy capacity is projected to fall from the record high of
358 GW in 2024, according to Fitch Ratings, adding that this was due to tighter
distributed solar policies and stressed returns. Still, China’s additions this year will
remain above 2023.

India / Wind power
Oyster Renewable has partnered with Suzlon Group to develop a 200 MW wind farm in
Madhya Pradesh.

India / Oil and gas
PM Modi has hailed a "mega partnership" with the U.S., as he and President Trump
agreed on a deal for India to import more American oil and gas. The U.S. is India’s fifth-
largest supplier of crude oil, but its market share has been in low single digits.
Washington is also India’s second-largest supplier of LNG after Qatar.
Indonesia / Renewables
Indonesia updated its National Power Supply Plan, projecting an additional 71 GW of
installed capacity over the next decade, with a focus on solar, hydropower, and
geothermal energy. The plan targets increasing the share of renewable energy to 35% of
the national energy mix by 2034.
Philippines / Renewables
In 2024, the Philippines installed 794 MW of new renewable energy capacity, according
to the Dept of Energy.

Philippines / Renewables
The Dept of Energy said the recent 3rd Green Energy Auction (GEA-3) recorded an
offered capacity of 7.5 GW, exceeding the installation target of 4.65 GW. A total of 14
projects, with delivery periods from 2025 to 2035, were submitted, including pumped-
storage hydropower facilities with installation targets ranging from 250 MW to 2 GW.

South Korea / Renewables
The Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) and the U.S. Dept of Energy’s National
Renewable Energy Laboratory inked an MoU for a joint renewable energy research and
technology development. Their collaboration will focus on key carbon-neutral
technologies such as solar energy, hydrogen, and energy storage.

Taiwan / Natural gas
Taiwan is interested in natural gas from Alaska and will continue to assess its feasibility
as the government looks to narrow the trade surplus with the U.S. and avoid tariffs.
Taiwan runs a trade surplus with the U.S. which rose 83% last year, as exports to the
U.S. hit a record $111 billion, driven by demand for high-tech products such as
semiconductors.
