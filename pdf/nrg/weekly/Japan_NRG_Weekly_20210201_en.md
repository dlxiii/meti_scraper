Panasonic to quit solar cells and panels business by 2022, focus on smart cities

(Nikkei Shimbun, Jan. 31)
•  Chinese rivals make the cells and panels much cheaper, and Panasonic no longer sees a future in
manufacturing solar energy related panels and cells. Co. plans exit by March 22.
•  Panasonic plans to continue solar panel installation for residential use, but will use other makers’
devices.
•  Panasonic will instead turn attention to power management systems for smart cities.
•  CONTEXT: Kyocera and Sharp will be the only major Japanese players in the solar panel industry.
• TAKEAWAY: Leaders in solar panels a decade ago, the decline of Japan’s manufacturers has been rapid and

accelerating in recent years, and largely due to expansion by Chinese companies. In 2011, Panasonic bought
Sanyo Electric’s cell business and aspired to be a global force in the industry. Last year, it ended a solar JV with
Tesla, and the latest announcement is merely the official confirmation of the exit from this business. What has
to worry Japanese energy officials is which companies in Japan will step up to manufacture the next
generation of cells and panels that promise to spread much further than the current equipment because of
their lightness and malleability.




Japan to help steel and other heavy industry fund emission cuts
(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 27)
•  The government will set guidelines to allow the sale of bonds and other financial products for
climate transition projects. The aim is to help CO2-heavy industries such as steel, chemicals,

electricity and maritime shipping.
•  The govt. hopes to draw in investors for industries that have so far struggled to attract financing via
green bonds.
•  The govt will use a report on climate transition finance issued last month by the International
Capital Market Association as the basis for its guidelines.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
One of Japan’s largest investors to force stocks it owns to decarbonize

(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 30)
o  Nippon Life Insurance, one of Japan's largest private institutional investors, aims to
achieve net-zero emissions for companies in its stock and bond portfolios by 2050.
o  The insurer will urge targets to cut C02 emissions and will consider divesting if
companies fail to make progress.
o  Nippon Life becomes the first major Japanese institutional investor to adopt such an

investment policy.
o  Nippon Life holds equity or debt in roughly 1,500 Japanese companies. Based on the
size of its stakes and other factors, Nippon Life's holdings account for an estimated 12
million tons of carbon dioxide per year.

Kawasaki Heavy to build 80 hydrogen carriers able to import 9M tons of the fuel by 2050
(Reuters, Jan. 27)
•  Co. will complete two commercial-scale ships to import 225,000 tons of hydrogen by 2030 and

expand from there to 80 carriers, importing 9 million tons by 2050.
•  Co. starts hydrogen imports from Australia this spring. The volume, extracted from brown coal and
liquified in Victoria, will be just 75 tons of hydrogen, enough for 15,000 fuel cell vehicles.
•  Kawasaki Heavy has experience in LNG shipping and is using that to build up its hydrogen
transportation system. In the process, it hopes hydrogen supply costs will drop to ¥29.7 per normal
cubic meter (Nm3) by 2030 from ¥100 now.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Mitsubishi Heavy aims to design world’s first liquid CO2 ship carrier
(Nikkei, Jan. 31)
o  Co. aims to put such a ship into commercial action around 2025.
o   The carrier is expected to be used in tandem with CCUS technologies. C02 captured from heavy industry
would be liquified and transported to port, from which a ship would take it to the underground storage facility.

JFE starts testing carbon capture tech at cleaning plants in Tokyo
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 27)
•  JFE Engineering has started a trial test of
•  CCU technology to capture CO2 from exhaust gas at cleaning plants in Mitaka and Choufu areas
of greater Tokyo.
•  The trial will last until the end of 2022. By applying CO2 capture technology to the incineration

plant and combining it with biomass, it is possible to achieve "negative carbon (CO2 capture
exceeds actual emissions)".
•  In addition to CO2 capture technology, JFE Engineering plans to conduct various tests on
chemical recycling, which would use the captured CO2. For example, it is possible to use the end
product as a fuel in the form of methane gas. The company will also accelerate research and
development of methanol, which can be produced from CO2 and hydrogen, and which is the basis
of various chemical products.




Osaka Gas urges customers to switch to LNG to save the environment
(Nikkei, Jan. 27)
•  Osaka Gas announced goals to reduce yearly CO2 emissions by 10 million metric tons by 2030/31,
and eventually achieve zero net emissions by 2050.
•  Osaka Gas is moving to boost its decarbonization credentials by expanding renewable capacity to

5 GW by 2030, and having it make up about 50% of the domestic power generation portfolio.
•  In addition, the company is also developing a specialist methanation technology. The utility plans
to achieve this goal by creating new technology to convert carbon dioxide into methane, by 2030.
•  CEO Fujiwara said this target will be partly achieved by inducing commercial clients, which
currently use fuel oil or coal as energy, to switch to natural gas.
•  Methane, the main component of LNG, is a raw material for city gas and is made up of CO2 and

hydrogen. It’s thought to offset the CO2 generated when burned.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Osaka Gas plans for carbon neutrality based on efficient methane synthesis
(New Energy Business News, Various, Jan. 28)

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  In a nationwide first, Osaka Gas has managed to successfully construct a commercial-
scale solid oxide electrolysis cell that electrolyzes steam and carbon dioxide at high
temperatures to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are then combined in
the presence of a catalyst to form methane.
o  By reusing the heat generated during synthesis, the process achieves energy efficiencies

of over 85%, which compares favorably to existing technologies, as well as to processes
that synthesize methane from electrolyzed hydrogen.
o  The new process also does away with the need to use ceramic-coated electrodes, which
are costly and difficult to scale.




Osaka Gas to develop technology that burns coal without using atmospheric oxygen
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 29)
•  Osaka Gas and the Japan Coal Energy Center have won a contract with the NEDO to develop a
chemical looping combustion process that would allow coal and biomass to be burned without
using atmospheric oxygen.
•  In chemical looping, fuels are combusted at high temperatures with metallic oxides such as iron
oxide without the addition of air. The carbon dioxide yielded is highly concentrated, making it

easier to retrieve.
•  Osaka Gas and the Japan Coal Energy Center aim to build a working 300 kW reactor by 2024.



Toho Gas to research technology to directly recover CO2 in atmosphere with LNG

(Jiji Press, Jan. 25)

the Fukushima disaster and cannot afford to incur additional costs in relation to the Tokai

NPP.



Fukushima: Nuclear regulator says new strategy needed as debris removal work fails
(Tokyo Shimbun, Jan. 27)
•  Nuclear Regulation Authority chair Fuketa Toyoshi said that an operation to remove radioactive

debris from Units 2 and 3 at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant will have to be rethought
in light of new findings.
•  All attempts to vent high-pressure radioactive steam present in the reactor of Unit 2 have been
unsuccessful.
•  In addition, extremely high levels of radioactivity have been measured around the “sealed plugs”
that cover the containment vessels for Units 2 and 3. This is a new “discovery”.
•  If the current approach continues to be unsuccessful, the containment vessels may need to be

filled with water before further attempts are made to remove debris, in order to shield workers
from radiation.
•  The regulator aims to prepare a report later this year to detail the findings from inspections and
analysis performed over 2019/20.



Kansai Electric announces delay to restart of Takahama NPP Units 3 and 4

(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 26)

Takahama Mayor to Announce Agreement to Restart Older Reactor Units
(Kyodo News, Jan. 28)
o  Mayor of Takahama Town, Fukui prefecture, is due to announce next week his consent to
restarting Units 1 and 2 of the Takahama NPP.
o  This is the first time in Japan that a local mayor consents to the restart of reactors that are

older than 40 years.
o  After the consent of the mayor, it is customary for the prefectural assembly and the
governor to make a decision. Until now, Governor Sugimoto Tatsuji had requested
KEPCO to give an outline of where they will be moving spent nuclear fuel before giving
any restart approvals.
o  KEPCO still has no answer to the governor’s request, and so it’s unclear whether they will
get the approval at governor level.

Mitsubishi hits out at opponents to its Vietnam coal power plant projects
(Tokyo Shimbun, Jan. 25)
•  Partners in the Vung Ang 2 coal-fired power station project in Vietnam have responded to an open
letter from local young people concerned about the environment that was published earlier this
month.
•  The youth are critical of the project, which they said was not in Vietnam’s interests and violated

Japan’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.
•  Vung Ang 2 has also been the target of protests by Fridays for Future, a group calling for
restrictions on coal plants, and these protests have been endorsed by Swedish activist Greta
Thunberg.
•  Project partner Mitsubishi Corporation has responded by saying that Hanoi is beset by chronic
power shortages which lead to frequent scheduled power outages. The city needs a new solution

to its power issues that will provide a constant supply of electricity day and night, says Mitsubishi.
•  Lenders Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui, and Mizuho all refused to comment on their
involvement in the project, although all five corporations mentioned their initiatives to reduce CO2
emissions in their responses.

Japan’s LNG imports dropped 3.7% last year to 74.47M tons
(Japan NRG, Jan. 27)
•  Annual total came to 74.47 million tons, less than the 77.33 million tons in 2019 and the lowest
since 2011.
•  December imports were at 7.72 million tons, the highest in three years for the same time period.

• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s LNG shortages at the start of this year may well be down to LNG purchase activities for
October and November deliveries. Both months were 4-5% lower than the year earlier even though purchasing
activities for the previous two months were closer aligned with previous years’ levels.





Sumitomo Corp to stop all new oil field investments in green shift
(Nikkei, Jan. 25)
•  Trading house Sumitomo Corp. will stop investing in new oil development projects. The Co. will be

the first of the nation’s trading houses to begin a shift away from crude.
•  The trading house wants to improve its ESG credentials amid pressure from climate activists and
investors.
•  The company will continue holding existing oil investments.
•  Sumitomo will shift its focus to renewable energy projects.
• TAKEAWAY: While most of its trading house peers were freezing investment in or exiting coal mining
altogether, Sumitomo Corp doubled down in recent years. The swift turnaround in global attitudes to fossil

fuels leaves the company with a large coal portfolio that will likely contrast with that of its domestic peers.
Since Sumitomo is not a strong player in oil, it seems it has exited from this fossil fuel segment to improve its
image. The company has also sold out of U.S. oil holdings.
• It’s unlikely that Sumitomo will stop trading in oil, since oil demand is not suddenly going to disappear; but its

decision to stop actively investing in oil will be enough to satisfy investors.

Sumitomo Metal Mining to Double Anode Production on EV demand
(Nikkei, Jan. 22)
•  Fujiwara Sumitomo Metal Mining plans to double production of anodes for electric vehicle
batteries by 2027.
•  Sumitomo is also considering building a nickel refinery in Indonesia to this end.
•  Sumitomo’s interests in nickel mines give it the advantage of controlling all aspects of the anode

supply chain, and puts the company in a good position to compete against Chinese anode
manufacturers. Under an agreement with a state-owned Indonesian mining company last year,
Sumitomo enjoys preferential rights to the mineral.
•  CONTEXT: Extremely high demand for nickel from Chinese battery manufacturers has created a
risk of interruptions to supply.

ANALYSIS


BY TOM O’SULLIVAN
Unlikely Hero of Japan’s Electricity Industry
Saddled with the “Sins” of the Country’s Past Energy Choices


As Japan’s energy emergency unfolded at the start of the year, one company (and
one fuel type) in particular kept the lights on. Electric Power Development Co., better
known as J-Power, and its heavily coal-reliant generator fleet ran at close to the limit.
Even when one of its coal units sputtered due to boiler trouble, the company switched
it to oil and pushed the machinery as much as it could.

For a change, there was some reward for J-Power’s toils. Its stock soared 30% over a
few days, adding $1 billion in market value, after halving during 2020. Still, the
company that has perennially rescued Japan during its worst power crunches faces an
uncertain future. The very assets that it used to help Japan avoid blackouts are now
pariah. And yet, both its coal and mid-construction nuclear facilities are merely the
result of the nation’s energy planning. J-Power only fully privatized in 2004.

The utility that provides 1/12th of Japan’s electricity and owns facilities in China, the
U.S., Southeast Asia and the U.K. desperately needs to re-invent itself for the new
green age. It would be to Japan’s disadvantage not to help its key industry player
negotiate the transition.


January’s dirty little secret
The focus at the start of this year was on problems in securing LNG. An emergency
rush to mobilize oil-burning units and generators attached to trucks took the
headlines. The reason Japan avoided major electricity shortages, however, was its
coal plants. Only 2.1 GW of coal capacity was offline during the first three weeks of
the year, with about 44 GW constantly delivering electricity during the period – 10%
more capacity than available a year earlier.

Meanwhile, Japan’s gas-fired capacity only fully came online during the second week
of 2021. On Jan. 1, the country had 23 GW of gas-fired power plants offline.

J-Power operates 14 coal-fired generators in Japan, the most of any company. Of
these, eight are consider as old and “inefficient” judging by the initial METI
benchmarks publicized in the summer of 2020. Coal plants that are deemed
“inefficient” will need to shut within a decade according to METI plans, which have
yet to be finalized.

Japan’s newly publicized shift to decarbonization and net-zero emissions by 2050 is a
daunting prospect for J-Power. Its thermal power assets have a book value of $3
billion and an average age of 31 years. J-Power said it will look to phase out old
plants by the country’s 2030 deadline, but details are as yet unclear.

The electricity company was set up shortly after World War II to help build new
generation facilities at a time of great shortages. It also stepped up to the plate in the
aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, playing the role of market stabilizer with its
large thermal power fleet.

In a statement of just how important J-Power is to Japan’s energy industry, in 2008
METI famously rejected a proposal by the Children’s Investment Fund (U.K.) to
increase its holdings of J-Power to as much as 20%, citing national energy security
concerns.

J-Power is Japan’s largest power wholesaler and operates across all of the country’s
islands in both generation and transmission. It is in a unique position to supplement
power shortages in that the 10 regional electricity utilities (EPCOs) are its major
customers. The operational plans of all the EPCOs, apart from Okinawa, have been
disrupted over the uncertainty of nuclear power assets.

While all utilities worked to maximize their capacity utilization in early 2021, J-Power’s
record stands out. It had only one unplanned shutdown since Christmas 2020. Even
that coal-fired unit was re-purposed to run on low-sulphur fuel oil to help stave power
shortages.

The tenacity compares to a glum 2020 for J-Power as it was cast among the potential
losers from the decarbonization trend. In H1 of FY2020 it suffered financially because
of lower wholesale prices caused in part by the pandemic with lower levels of
economic activity and reduced power consumption. The company's revenues
averaged ¥10/ kWh in the first six months of FY2020, with a 75% load factor on its
generation assets.

Last year, to better approach the need to transition its asset base, J-Power transferred
all of its thermal fleet to a new company called J-POWER Generation Service.

electricity spot prices, but the company has also seen capital markets become more
cautious on financing future projects. Many banks already face restrictions on new
financing for coal projects, while J-Power still has $16 billion of debt on its balance
sheet and ongoing construction. J-Power burns 20 million tons of coal annually, which
is procured mainly from Australia, Indonesia and Russia.

What’s more, the company is trying to complete a 1.3 GW nuclear power plant in
Ohma, Aomori Prefecture, its first venture into nuclear power.

Given the financing risks now associated with both coal and nuclear, J-Power has
made a belated push into other alternative energy sources to build on its strong
position in domestic hydropower, which accounts for 60% of its Japanese facilities.

J-Power has invested $25 million in Sydney-based renewables developer, Genex,
which is developing a major hydropower project in northern Queensland, Australia. It
also bought into its first solar project in the U.S., last year in Texas.

The company sold a 40% stake in a thermal Taiwanese utility last year to raise ¥20
billion for investments in renewables.

J-Power has quickly built up a 500 MW portfolio in wind energy, and last year
partnered with JERA and Equinor of Norway to pursue offshore wind projects in
northern Japan. Together with KDDI, the company is also pioneering the use of drone
technology for conducting inspections of wind power facilities.

Meanwhile, the utility is exploring options that may help to extend the lifespan of
existing thermal facilities by retrofitting or converting them. J-Power has started to
replace coal with sewage sludge at some power units and is testing the idea of
converting some coal plants to run on syngas (gas synthesized from coal). Hydrogen is
another option as J-Power pursues a brown hydrogen project in Australia.

Despite its troubles with energy transition, J-Power’s pivotal role in the Japanese
market could make it an important player in efforts to consolidate the industry and
merge weaker players. J-Power’s significant hydropower asset fleet will also be a
competitive advantage in the race to carbon neutrality.

ANALYSIS

BY DANIEL SHULMAN

PRINCIPLE
SHULMAN ADVISORY
Japan’s Power Grid is Changing. So Is Its Funding Model.

Having been built mainly in the late 20th century, Japan!s power grid is aging and
needs an upgrade. What’s more, the emergence of renewable energy as a
considerable component of the power mix is changing the way that a grid must
operate and raising the costs of running the electricity network.

With more of the smaller, distributed power facilities coming online recently to join
the large plants owned by traditional utilities, Japan is starting to reexamine the way
that the grid is funded. The agility and strength of the power network will be vital if
the country is to truly embrace a higher renewables component in its electricity mix.
But who is going to pay for that?

The traditional cost-sharing between consumers and power generators is getting
revamped.


The Changing Role of the Japanese Power Grid
Before the deregulation of the Japanese power market, large regional utilities like
TEPCO and Kansai Electric served as the power generator, transmission and
distribution agent, and retailer of electricity. Each major electric power company
(EPCO) focused only on its region.

Physically, power was delivered from large power plants operated by these utilities to
consumers in each utility!s island zone. The flow of power within the grid was relatively
simple and unidirectional. Power generated at large power plants was transmitted to
transformer substations through high-voltage lines, and from there it was distributed
to consumers through low-voltage lines.

With deregulation and increased adoption of renewable generation and other
distributed power sources, the power grid has become more complex. Not only are
there many more power plants on the grid than in the past, but the flow of power is
no longer unidirectional. This is because new power sources often feed into low-
voltage lines; from there, the power has to flow into high-voltage lines to be
transmitted to other parts of the grid.

The deregulation and subsequent increase in the number of power generators also
mean that the grid has gone from primarily benefiting consumers, who need it to
receive power, to also benefiting power generators, who need it to sell their power.


Changes to the Way the Grid Is Funded
The increasing complexity of power flow within the grid, along with the grid!s aging,
require more funding to keep the system operational. That has led the Japanese
government to reconsider the way grid infrastructure maintenance and expansion are
funded.

18


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Overall, there are three types of grid infrastructure and each is funded differently.
Power supply lines connect power plants to primary substations, and are paid for by
power generators. Local power grid costs are shared among power generators and
consumers in proportion to the benefit each receives. Finally, distribution systems,
which deliver power from substations to end consumers, are fully paid for by
consumers.

In short: power generators pay their share of the costs when connecting their power
plants to the grid, while the contribution from consumers comes over time as an
ongoing basis payment known as wheeling charges.
















That simple division of payments is no longer deemed fair. To reflect the changing
dynamics in grid usage, starting in FY 2023, the Japanese government plans to
increase the share of grid infrastructure costs paid by power generators by introducing
mandatory monthly fees. Because grid infrastructure is designed based on capacity
rather than generated volume, the new fees are expected to be calculated based on
each power plant!s capacity rather than actual generation volumes, although this point
remains up for further debate.

While the exact fee will depend on the power generator!s location, the national
average is expected to be around ¥150/ kW. Micro-generators under 10 kW will be
exempt from the new fee. Also, some power generators may receive a discount under
conditions such as operating in an area with a well-developed grid infrastructure and
having lower marginal transmission cost than the zone’s average.

It is expected that regional differences in the new monthly fees will result in a lower
overall total cost to deliver power to consumers. Under the new system, power
generators will not only need to consider a location!s ability to generate electricity
from the sun or wind, but also the amount of monthly fees they will need to pay. The
amount saved with the new fees could reach ¥20 billion in wind generation alone,
according to a study by big-business lobby Keidanren.


Backlash Against the Changes
In 2018, the government amended the upper limit of the cost paid by consumers for a
power plant!s initial grid connection. Before June 2018, the maximum amount
covered by consumers varied by power source. The amount for biomass plants could

19


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

be as high as ¥49,000/ kW, while for solar plants it was at just ¥15,000/ kW. In other
words, consumers paid less for power sources with lower utilization rates. Since 2018,
the standardized cap for all power sources is ¥41,000/ kW.

Even though the amendment was made to compensate power generators for the new
burden coming in the form of monthly fees, some industry players have noted that not
all power generators benefit from the amendment. For many, the new monthly fees
simply result in increased costs.

The way the monthly fees are calculated has also drawn criticism from operators of
renewables projects, who claim that the payment is not consistent with the new rules
(currently under government review) on grid access priority.

When it comes to grid access, solar and other renewable power plants are expected
to get preferential treatment compared to coal and other less environmentally friendly
power plants. When it comes to a universal monthly fee, however, solar and wind
operators claim they are at a disadvantage due to the fact that their generation
volume depends on weather conditions, and thus, their utilization rates are generally
low.

As a result, the monthly fee for a solar plant with a 15% utilization would end up
adding ¥1.37/ kWh to costs, according to Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association
estimates. For a thermal power plant with a 70% utilization rate, the additional cost
would work out as ¥0.26/ kWh. A wind power plant with a 25% utilization rate would
take on an extra ¥0.82/ kWh cost burden.


An Ongoing Debate
There is little doubt as to whether the new monthly fees will be introduced. In fact, in
December 2020, various groups representing renewable power operators including
the Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association, Japan Wind Power Association, and Japan
Geothermal Association expressed their agreement with the introduction of the new
fees.

However, since those same associations also oppose using maximum output capacity
(kW) to calculate the charges, lobbying instead for them to be based on actual
generated volume (kWh), how the new fees will be calculated remains to be
determined.

The government’s plan is to introduce those charges in FY 2023. The original deadline
for making the decision (April last year) has already passed, suggesting a final ruling is
likely in the next 12 months.

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Biden:
The U.S. president issued several new executive orders on Wednesday (‘Climate Day’)
addressing climate change and elevating the issue to a national security priority. He
described climate change as the "existential threat of our time”, established a
National Climate Task Force, and ordered his Director of National Intelligence to
prepare an estimate of the security costs of climate change.
Biden also ordered a suspension on new oil and gas exploration on federal lands and
offshore waters, which could impact over 20% of U.S. oil production. He announced
plans to halt all fossil fuel subsidies and to convert the federal government’s transport
fleet to EVs.
Biden will host an international climate summit on April 22 to which Japan is expected
to be invited, and prior to which the U.S. is expected to announce its carbon
reduction plans for 2030.
Biden also directed the Interior Department to identify steps to double U.S. offshore
wind capacity by 2030.
At the same time, the president announced a “Buy American” government
procurement plan that is likely to negatively impact Japanese exporters.

Oil:
1). BP, the U.K. oil major, is reported to have cut its senior oil and gas exploration
team by almost 80%, to 100 staff, as it transitions from fossil fuels to carbon neutrality.
2). Horizonal rig counts in the Shale Permian Basin have now recovered by 60% since
last July’s lows due to higher oil prices. Haliburton, Baker Hughes, and Schlumberger,
the three major U.S. oil services companies, are all reporting improved revenues.
3). Exxon has announced plans to overhaul the structure of its board of directors and
step-up sustainability investments.

EVs:
1). General Motors became the first car-major to announce it will stop selling petrol
and diesel cars by 2035.
2). Tesla, which has a market capitalization of $790 billion, announced its first ever
annual profit of $720 million for fiscal 2020.
3). The market capitalization of Evergrande Auto, the Chinese EV company listed in
Hong Kong, exceeded $51 billion following a strategic investment of $3.3 billion.
4). Proterra, a U.S. electric bus maker, and EVgo Services, a U.S.-based charging
network, went public via a SPAC listing bringing the total number of EV-related SPAC
listings to 18 since the beginning of last year.

Covid-19:
1). Following international requests Panasonic is trialing ultra-cold freezer box
technology for storage of Covid-19 vaccines..
2). New Zealand has announced its international borders will be closed throughout
most of 2021.


21

China:
1). Wind, solar, and hydropower accounted for $11 billion of China’s Belt & Road
energy infrastructure investments in 2020, exceeding fossil fuel investments for the
first time.
2). China overtook the U.S. as the largest destination for FDI in 2020 with inbound
investments increasing by 4% YoY to $163 billion.
3). John Kerry criticized China’s recent climate goals as “inadequate”.
4). Xi Jinping called for more global cooperation on climate change in a virtual
address at the World Economic Forum last week.

Taiwan:
Chinese fighter jets and bombers flew into Taiwan’s air defense zone last weekend,
creating more tensions around the island. China has warned Taiwan that a declaration
of independence would be an act of war. Taiwan’s representative to the U.S. attended
the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 as an invited guest, angering China.

South Korea:
Hyundai Motor plans to increase EV sales by 60% in 2021 to 160,000 units.

Vietnam:
The ruling Communist Party commenced its congress meeting last Tuesday in Hanoi,
which convenes every five years to pick the party’s general secretary, the country’s
president and prime minister. Prime Minister Suga’s first overseas trip was to Vietnam
where Japan has considerable energy investments.

Indonesia:
1). Indonesia seized an Iranian oil tanker off West Kalimantan Province in Borneo for
illegal transfers of fuel oil.
2). Indonesia’s maritime minister, Lahut Binsar Panjaitan, has obtained commitments
from the U.S. government to invest $2 billion in Indonesia’s sovereign wealth fund.
Part of the fund may be used to construct the new capital city on the island of Borneo,
which is expected to cost over $30 billion and be extremely energy intensive.

India:
Cairn Energy, the U.K. oil and gas company listed on the London Stock Exchange, is
threatening to seize Indian government assets unless the country’s government
reimburses a $1.2 billion tax settlement ordered by an Indian court.

Saudi Arabia:
1). Saudi officials announced that they plan to double the assets of the Public
Investment Fund, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, to $1 trillion by 2025. The PFI
has invested $45 billion in SoftBank-controlled Vision Fund and derives most of its
revenues from Aramco, the listed oil monopoly.
2). It was also revealed last week that the U.S. military is expanding its regional
defense footprint in Saudi Arabia to the western parts of the Arabian Peninsula.
3). The new U.S. administration has also ordered a suspension and review of arms
sales to Saudi Arabia and UAE.

Iran:
Severe power shortages in Iran are increasingly being blamed on bitcoin mining. After
the recent round of oil and gas sanctions an estimated 60% of Iranians are thought to
live below the poverty line.

that is controlled by Kurdish militias.

Russia:
1). Russian vessels re-commenced work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline inside
Denmark’s EEZ as Gazprom races to complete the project, which will double Russia’s
gas exports to Germany.
2). Calls for additional sanctions against Russia because of the arrest of Alexei Navalny
were not approved by E.U. officials.

Nigeria:
Royal Dutch Shell has been found liable by a Dutch court for damages caused to
agriculture by two oil spills in the Nigerian delta over a decade ago. The company had
already suffered losses in excess of $1 billion for clean-ups in Ogoniland.

France:
Hydrogen Refueling Solutions, a French refueling company, listed its stock on
Euronext last week, raising E70 million, and valuing the company at E360 million.

Germany:
Siemens Energy which manufactures gas and power turbines, announced strong Q1

attributable mainly to its offshore wind and services divisions.

United Kingdom:
1). EDF is seeking an additional Stg500 million to complete the Hinkley Point nuclear
project and has asked for an additional six-month extension. Total project completion
costs are now estimated at $32 billion, with an expected delivery date in mid-2026.
2). Royal Dutch Shell announced the acquisition of the largest E.V. public charging
network in the U.K, Ubitricity, which has 2,700 charge points in the U.K.
3). The U.K. is facing criticism for the level of its financial commitments in the recently
announced green energy/climate program, which is around 30% of the commitments
announced by Germany and France.

Ecuador:
Credit Suisse and ING announced they would cease trading and financing support for
exports of the country’s Amazonian oil because of climate change issues.

United States:
1). Due to regulatory challenges, NextEra Energy has taken an impairment charge of
$1.2 billion on the Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline that was meant to transport
