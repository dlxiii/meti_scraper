METI publishes outline of centralized offshore wind survey system

(Japan NRG, Jan. 30)
•  METI proposed an outline of the centralized offshore wind survey system, aiming to improve
efficiency of project surveys and assessments.
•  Some surveys and data collection overlapped among groups planning to participate in the same
auction.
•  The centralized system covers: 1) identifying project areas and soliciting project auction
participations, 2) coordination with regional stakeholders, 3) JOGMEC to conduct wind, weather
and seafloor surveys of sites, 4) METI to secure network connection bandwidth, 5) environmental

impact assessment and 6) fishery impact surveys.
•  CONTEXT: Until 2022, NEDO did basic weather and seafloor surveys, but now JOGMEC will
conduct more elaborate studies tailored to project requirements. The first survey will be made this
year at Ganwu-Minami Shiribeshi, Shimasaki, and Hiyama coastal zones in Hokkaido.
• TAKEAWAY: The MoE also launched an effort to revise the Environmental Assessment Act in a bid to make the
reporting process more efficient. MoE, however, has not set timelines for writing the proposed amendments as
any changes are certain to spark hot debates.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
State panel publishes analysis of legal issues for offshore wind in the EEZ
(Japan NRG, Jan. 31)
o  A group of scholars advising the Cabinet released an analysis of international legal issues

regarding offshore wind installations in the EEZ.
o  The panel concluded that installations are structures and facilities, although in the past
floating installations have been categorized as vessels. The panel based its analysis on
the definitions in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
o  UNCLOS also mandates the rights of countries to operate installations, but prevents
them from blocking the free travel of vessels.
o  The 60th UNCLOS article defines the safety zones around offshore installations, which are

limited to an area 500 meters from an installation.
o  The government needs to clarify what items are needed to notify neighboring countries,
and what would not require notification under UNCLOS rules, the panel noted.
o  CONTEXT: The panel, headed by professor Kisugi Shin of Yokohama National University,
was formed in October last year, to advise the Cabinet secretariat, MLIT, ANRE, Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and the MoE.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Wind farms are legal in the EEZ 370 km offshore, says state panel
(Nikkei, Jan. 31)
o  An expert state panel for offshore wind farm policy said the building of wind farms in
Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is allowed under international law.

o  While Japanese law currently limits wind farms to territorial waters (22 km offshore), the
government will consider whether this rule should be amended.
o  Japan’s EEZ extends 370 km from shore.




METI to publish guidelines for supply chain carbon footprint measurements
(Japan NRG, Jan. 31)
•  In February, METI plans to invite public feedback for its proposed guidelines for measuring carbon
footprints throughout supply chains, to complement international standards. The feedback period
will run for two weeks.
•  The guidelines spell out rules for comparing carbon footprints of competing products and

encourage use of primary data.
•  The guidelines will be officially released in March.
• TAKEAWAY: Industrial associations are expected to set carbon boundaries of products within their supply
chains, which won’t be rigidly defined in the new guidelines. The associations have other heavy tasks such as
making sure definitions of components and raw materials are uniform throughout the supply chains.




ANRE modifies 2023-2027 bioethanol plan details following public feedback
(Japan NRG, Feb. 1)
•  ANRE has modified figures and wording in the 2023-2027 national green energy goals that were
set as required by the Act of Advancement of Energy Supply Structures. The issue was open for

public input until Jan 27.
•  After re-calculations, life cycle GHG figures of U.S. corn-derived ethanol changed to 36.86g CO2/
MJ from 37.10g/ MJ, and Brazilian sugar cane-derived ethanol to 28.59g/ MJ from 28.56g/ MJ.
•  ANRE will keep the annual bioethanol consumption goal at 0.5 million kiloliters crude equivalent
since its strategy is to improve energy security by developing local resources.




Japan requires local governments to allow search for final repository for spent nuclear fuel
(Jiji, Feb. 2)
•  The government will revise its basic policy on the final disposal of high-level radioactive waste
(nuclear waste) generated from spent fuel from nuclear power plants.
•  The government will ask municipal bodies to allow searches by The Nuclear Waste Management
Organization of Japan (NUMO) for suitable sites for spent fuel.
•  CONTEXT: Currently, such work can only be launched based on a request from a local

government. The central government will now give NUMO the agency to pursue the search
without waiting on municipalities to volunteer.
• TAKEAWAY: To date, only two local governments – Hokkaido Prefecture’s Kamoenai Village and Suttsu Town
– have agreed to have their area surveyed for suitability as a waste storage hub. PM Kishida’s administration
has called for greater utilization of nuclear energy, and so, efforts to solve the nuclear waste disposal issue
have also increased.

METI, MoE study expanding JCM methodology, guidelines to include CCS projects
(Japan NRG, Feb. 3)
•  In 2021, METI and MoE launched a study on carbon capture and storage (CCS), aiming to add it to
the Joint Crediting Mechanism framework.

•  CCS, Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) will be included in the
expanded JCM guidelines and methodology now under discussion. Carbon capture and utilization
(CCU) will not be included.
•  Detecting long-term leakage of CO2 is an issue.
•  A credit reserve system is proposed where some verified credits are held as reserves, taking into
account risks of carbon leakages. If there’s leakage, credits are canceled.
•  CONTEXT: METI together with JGC Corporation, J-Power, and other companies have launched

CCS and CCUS feasibility studies in Indonesia and Thailand, eyeing them as potential JCM
projects. METI hopes these efforts will increase activity in the Asia CCUS Network, a policymaking
platform of energy ministries in ASEAN, Australia and the U.S.



MLIT releases Tomakomai GX Hub plan

(Japan NRG, Feb. 1)
•  The MLIT released the Tomakomai GX Hub plan. This area in Hokkaido hosts several thermal
power plants, an oil refinery and the country’s sole CCS project (in pilot phase).
•  The goal is to combine the area’s potential for green hydrogen supply chains and CCUS.
•  The area is estimated to have a total solar capacity of 236 MW, with some wind and biomass
power potential. Local renewable capacity could be expanded to 1 GW.
•  CONTEXT: Tomakomai is the nation’s base for CCUS technology development. Japan CCS, a

geophysical survey firm, has captured 300,000 tons of CO2 from an Idemitsu oil refinery and has
stored the gas underground in Tomakomai. Surveys for additional storage areas in the region are
underway.


Obayashi Corp allowed to forge carbon credits from green hydrogen project in New Zealand

(Government statement, Feb. 2)
•  The MoE recognized Obayashi Corp’s green hydrogen production and transport project in New
Zealand. This means, the project is eligible for carbon offset credits under the Joint Crediting
Mechanism.
•  Obayashi will produce green hydrogen using renewable power, and transport the hydrogen. The
Japanese government will finance part of the project.
• TAKEAWAY: Obayashi has experience with green hydrogen facility installations thanks to a domestic project

that sources its electricity from geothermal power generation. The hydrogen is then transported by land. The
construction conglomerate also plans a pilot project that will use green hydrogen to manufacture asphalt.

ENEOS to commercialize tech for shipping hydrogen via oil tankers by 2025
(Company Statement, Nikkei, Jan.30)
•  ENEOS plans to commercialize a technology that can transporting hydrogen at room temperature
in oil tankers by FY2025.

•  In February, the energy group will start a demonstration facility in Brisbane, Australia that will bind
hydrogen with toluene, a chemical, to create a liquid compound known as MCH
(methylcyclohexane).
•  CONTEXT: MCH can be shipped more easily since it can use existing vessels. Standalone
hydrogen gas has to be cooled to extremely low temperatures for transportation.
•  ENEOS will create its hydrogen (via MCH) using renewable energy, which would classify the

hydrogen as “green”. The company will deploy a 150-kW solar-powered electrolyzer at the
Brisbane facility, testing its performance over eight months.
•  During this trial period, ENEOS plans to ship 2-3 tons of hydrogen (via MCH) to Japan. This is
enough to fuel 400 to 600 fuel cell vehicles.
•  By FY2025, ENEOS plans to scale up the electrolyzer size to 5 MW, which would allow for
commercial scale operations. This would also lower the cost of hydrogen production.
• TAKEAWAY: ENEOS is a member of the CO2-free Hydrogen Energy Supply-chain Technology Research
Association (HySTRA) organized by NEDO. The pilot project started in 2020 in Australia with brown coal
gasification and hydrogen refining, hydrogen liquefaction and storage of liquefied hydrogen (LH2), as well as
marine transportation of LH2 from Australia to Japan.




IHI introduces first use case for e-methane in Japan as fuel for buses
(Company Statement, Jan. 23)
•  Engineering group IHI started supplying e-methane (also known as synthetic methane) to a local
government owned community bus operator in Soma City, Fukushima Prefecture.
•  The fuel is made using green hydrogen that’s derived from solar-generated electricity generated at
the Soma IHI Green Energy Center.
•  The IHI center has a refueling stand, which used to provide fuel for LNG vehicles.

• TAKEAWAY: See this week’s Analysis section for an in-depth look at the e-methane market in Japan.


METI to support development of gas turbines that blend in more than 30% of hydrogen

(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 3)
•  METI will financially support development of gas turbines with a hydrogen mix ratio of more than
30%.
•  Part of the ¥300 billion additionally budgeted in FY2022 for the Green Innovation Fund will be
used for this project.
•  METI determined that a 30% co-firing ratio, which had been as the original target, wasn’t enough

to compete on the global market.
•  CONTEXT: The Green Innovation Fund was launched in 2021 with a ¥2 trillion budget. So far, up
to ¥1.83 trillion has already been committed to 19 projects over 10 years, with an additional ¥300
billion added to the fund in the second supplementary budget for FY2022.

Major utilities face losses of over ¥1 trillion; worst result since 2013

(Kyodo, Feb. 2)
•  All of Japan’s 10 major power companies, with the exception of Chubu Electric, expect a loss in
the quarter representing the first three months of 2023.
•  The result is attributed to high LNG and coal prices, and a weak yen.
•  Total losses amongst the nine utilities are projected to exceed ¥1 trillion: the worst result since the
same period in 2013.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO loses ¥651 billion in Oct-December quarter

(Company Statement, Feb. 1)
o  TEPCO reported a consolidated loss of ¥651 billion in the three months to December.
This is despite the company posting a ¥123 billion gain on the sale of subsidiaries and
affiliates’ stock and a ¥63 billion gain on sales of fixed assets.
o  TEPCO reported a profit of ¥9.9 billion in the same period 2021.
• TAKEAWAY: TEPCO’s heavy exposure to fossil fuels led to the largest loss of any utility for the last three
months of a calendar year. It is bigger than the loss after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 (¥623

billion yen). The company has one operational nuclear plant but cannot restart it due to low public trust
towards the utility since the Fukushima accident.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

FTC: unauthorized access to EPCOs customer data potentially breaches antitrust law
(TBS, Feb. 1)
•  Japan’s Fair Trade Commission’s secretary general Kobayashi Wataru said EPCOs’ unauthorized
access to customer data of other market entrants possibly violates the Electricity Business Act and

the Anti-Monopoly Act.
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) is investigating Tohoku, Chubu,
Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu electric power companies. The FTC has no plan to launch a
separate probe, Kobayashi said.
•  Kobayashi said that while JFTC has not launched any investigation of the major power companies,
also known as EPCOs, the possibility of future probes has not been ruled out.
• TAKEAWAY: In December 2022, Chubu, Chugoku and Kyushu electric power companies were hit by the FTC

with a fine of ¥100 billion in total for cartel-related business practices. It remains unclear how and when the
EPCOs can improve compliance.
In theory, JFTC has the capacity to launch a separate probe. EGC may escalate the case to JFTC. The power

operators, whose customer data were exposed, could file complaints to the JFTC.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
KEPCO breaches worse than thought; over 40,000 electricity subscribers accessed illegally
(Yomiuri Shimbun, Jan. 30)
o  KEPCO now says staff illegally accessed records of over 40,000 electricity subscribers

between April and December last year, nearly 3 times greater than initially thought.
o  KEPCO also revealed that 1,000 staff were involved.
o  Similar breaches were also revealed at Tohoku Electric, Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric,
Shikoku Electric, and Kyushu Electric.

Kansai Electric has four more reactors in operation at the moment.


ANRE to allow power retailers more flexibility over long-term contracts

(Japan NRG, Jan. 31)
•  ANRE plans to allow power retailers, which source supply from power operators on long-term
contracts, to resell the contract to other retailers.
•  CONTEXT: Retailers say that uncertainty in future consumer demand has discouraged them from
signing long-term purchase contracts; meanwhile power operators need 10–20-year supply
contracts to secure financing.
• TAKEAWAY: Tokyo Commodity Exchange’s head of power markets, Yamashita Masahiro, told ANRE that

market tools to forecast prices 10-20 years ahead are instrumental for power supply stability. However,

High-voltage contracts of new power firms fell below 200,000
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 2)
•  According to the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC), the number of high-
voltage contracts held by new power players fell below 200,000 in October 2022, the biggest drop

in five years.
•  CONTEXT: Many new power companies are slimming down their customer base to avoid going
further into the red as they are losing money on certain contracts. As a result, many customers are
returning to the EPCOs.
• TAKEAWAY: For years, new electric power companies were aggressively acquiring new customers. Now,
they’re more cautious about new customers. Customers with low load factors, in particular, were first to exit
when faced with large price hikes. Independent power retailers focus on managing peak demand so that

procurement volume always exceeds sales volume. The aim was to minimize spot market procurement even
during high demand periods.

Japan Hopes to Develop Synthetic Methane
Into Staple Energy Supply

In November 2022, “e-methane” debuted at the Japan Gas Association (JGA) with
much fanfare. This nearly carbon-neutral methane is synthetic; it is produced from
captured CO2 and green hydrogen or other non-fossil energy sources.

For its production, any type of CO2 can be used as feedstock, so long as it does not
contain sulfur or other impurities that cause catalysts to degrade. This in turn,
however, raises questions such as from where the carbon is coming and what is the
emission threshold for green hydrogen.

Amid all the excitement at the November event, the JGA even provided an “e-
methane” logo to certify companies in the recycled carbon value chain. The move was
probably premature. At the moment, no company has a specific timetable to
commercialize e-methane.

To better understand the potential offered by e-methane and the challenges that its
development faces, Japan NRG spoke to leading companies in the industry.


Cheap renewable energy is crucial
As a first step, the production of synthetic methane involves the capture of CO2, such
as from industrial sites, and the generation of hydrogen by separating its molecules
from water by electrolysis. Then, there’s methanation, which is when carbon,
hydrogen and catalysts react to produce methane.

When methane is consumed, it releases CO2, but in theory this is offset since the
synthetic fuel was originally made from captured CO2. The net result on the CO2 in
the atmosphere is said to be near zero.

Methanation is a century-old technology that has evolved rapidly in recent years. The
Japanese government began to fund its own research in 2017, hoping to possibly
replace LNG-derived city gas with synthetic methane.

The methanation process requires little energy as the molecules involved release heat
during chemical reactions. There’s almost no byproduct from the chemical reactions,
except for carbon and hydrogen that failed to react. Initially, catalysts made from
ruthenium and alumina were common, but in recent years nickel, ruthenium and other
elements are used, improving performance.

Since the catalysts can be recycled, and existing city gas infrastructure can be used to
deliver the methane to consumers, it potentially offers a neat solution. The major
setback has been the large amount of electricity required for the electrolysis process,
which accounts for over 90% of power used to create e-methane.

In general, around 20 MWh of power is needed to produce one ton of e-methane. In
order to make e-methane carbon neutral, electrolysis needs to be powered by a
significant source of cheap renewables, which Japan currently has limited access to.


The business players
In Japan, INPEX, Hitachi Zosen, IHI and Tokyo Gas are the forerunners competing to
be the first to commercialize e-methane. In 2024-2025, INPEX plans pilot production
at its Nagaoka plant, using the Sabatier methanation method. The pilot involves the
transport of synthetic methane through an INPEX gas pipeline and a possible sale of
the fuel. The company’s Nagaoka facility will have a 400 nm3/ hour capacity and
possibly be Japan’s largest.

Presently, Hitachi Zosen’s 125 nm3/ hour plant is the country’s largest methanation
plant. The company said it has entered into an agreement with China’s Yulin Chemical
to test a 500 nm3/ hour plant in the Shaanxi province of China. The Hitachi-Yulin
plant, if completed, will likely be the world’s largest.

Tokyo Gas installed a 12.5 nm3/ hour methanation plant at its Yokohama R&D facility
last year. It will start field tests with Yokohama City this year using biogas that contains
carbon and possibly sulfur as feedstock.

The companies have no commercialization plans yet, but they’re reaching out to
partners overseas to conduct feasibility studies.

home market.

However, the Japan Gas Association (JGA) is eyeing another possibility.

“The concept of carbon recycling is not found in the ISO, GHG protocol or IPCC
guidelines, so we want to spread the idea,” said Kohara Mitsuhiro, JGA’s international
certification and standardization general manager.
Spreading the idea of carbon recycling is a priority, and narrowing down its definition,
conducting life cycle assessment of the entire value chain, and developing robust
verification and reporting technologies will follow.

While e-methane aims to show that it is a clean energy source, it does not accept all
CO2-free energy inputs. For example, using nuclear power to make hydrogen is not
allowed under JGA definitions. Similarly, the use of batteries is also off the table
because they are a secondary energy source, unless the batteries are storing nature-
derived energy.

Green hydrogen threshold figures are wide-ranging, from 1.4 kg of CO2/ ton to 3 kg/
ton in the EU and the U.S. The JGA is monitoring regulatory developments overseas,
notably in the EU, which has seen a surge of interest in synthetic methane.

The JGA is also designing plans to count and offset carbon. If e-methane is produced
overseas, the carbon offset credits should be transferable to Japan. The JGA plans to
use frameworks under the Paris Agreement such as the Joint Crediting Mechanism,
the scope of which the government plans to expand to include projects funded
entirely by the private sector. (See Japan NRG Weekly’s January 10 issue for an
interview with MoE’s JCM point man).


Challenges to commercialization
The effort to spread the e-methane concept won’t bear fruit unless costs are brought
down to levels acceptable to the market. The JGA sees the cost at ¥120/ nm3 by
2030, and aims to cut it to ¥40-50/ nm3 by 2050. One possible solution is minimizing
energy losses throughout the methanation processes, said Ogasawara Kei,
methanation technology manager at Tokyo Gas.

Tokyo Gas together with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is
developing hybrid electrolysis-methanation equipment where heat released in the
methanation process can be used for electrolysis.

“There’s a 50% loss of renewable energy during the methanation process, but our
goal is to improve the energy utilization rate to 80%,” said Ogasawara, adding that to
make e-methane cheaper the life-cycle of catalysts needs to be longer; and initial
capital investments and running costs of the production plants will have to be
trimmed, while scaling up their capacities.

Meanwhile, Osaka Gas is developing solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) methanation
technology that could possibly reduce costs while scaling up production.

Currently, electrolysis and 12.5 nm3/ hour methanation equipment cost several ¥100
million each, and are mostly produced by Hitachi Zosen and IHI, and with a handful of
manufacturers overseas. However, it’s hoped that competition will drive more market
entries, higher efficiencies and lower costs.


Goals in place
For now, the future path of the e-methane value chain remains uncertain. The only
clear timetable is the government’s 2030 goal to make e-methane account for a mere
1% of Japan’s city gas supplies.

Major hurdles need to be overcome, including establishing carbon recycling
methodologies that can be included in the JCM and other programs. The JGA hopes
the framework to develop global e-methane standards will be ready when the
technologies are fully developed.

A Small Solution for a Big Problem:
Resolving Japan’s Grid Congestion


As Japan plans more solar and wind capacity, attention is focusing on grid solutions to
help accommodate the intermittency of some renewables supply. The big-picture
vision in the recently released draft of the Power System Master Plan for 2050 Japan
calls for as much as ¥7 trillion in investments to decarbonize the system.

There are solutions, however, that could bolster the use of renewables without an
entire system rebuild or the installation of new, bigger transmission lines. One solution
relies on the same thing that generates renewable power in the first place: the
weather.

A technology called dynamic line-rating (DLR) can improve the capacity to transmit
electricity of an existing transmission line by adjusting throughput based on outside
temperature and other conditions. By adding sensors to cables, a grid operator can
determine how much electricity volume the lines can safely carry without overheating.

More use of variable energy sources causes fluctuations in electricity transmission
flows and peaks that are more pronounced than in conventional energy systems. Tech
such as DLR can provide a low-cost solution that could add a few percentage points
to efficiency without waiting years for big-budget public works to revamp the system.


How it works
The volume of electricity that a power line can transmit safely depends on ambient
conditions. In Japan, the ampacity (i.e. the maximum current carrying capacity) is
calculated using a model climate condition that assumes an air temperature of 40°C
with wind speed at 0.5 m/s and solar radiation at 1,000W/ m².

In other words, the volume of electricity that a power line can carry is based on
summer weather conditions. For the majority of the year, the weather is milder.










Source: IRENA
DLR systems have been available since the 1990s, with France and Belgium leading
efforts to explore the technology, according to the International Renewable Energy
Agency (IRENA). But only with the rapid deployment of solar and wind in recent years
has spurred pilot projects for this innovation.

In addition to checking air temperature, European researchers focus on wind speed,
and the temperature and sagging of a power line. Estimates on how much DLR can
increase the maximum capacity of power lines vary. The European Network of
Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSOE) says it can achieve an
increase of between 40% and 100% compared to static line-rating. It also says that in
Europe typical ampacity gains of 10 to 15% can be expected over 90% of the time,
although results depend on the methodology.

As for cost, according to a 2017 study by American Electric Power (AEP), an Ohio-
based utility, a simulation of a hypothetical DLR deployment on three sections of a 22-
mile transmission line found that the installation and implementation cost would be
about $500,000 with a commercially available DLR system.

This could achieve a net congestion savings of more than $4 million, indicating a
payback period of two months. In comparison, an upgrade of the same transmission
line would cost between $22 million and $176 million, according to a report by the
U.S. Department of Energy.

Some of the best practice applications of DLR technology include the interconnection
between Belgium and France, according to ENTSOE. Commercially available sensors
were used to measure real-time sag directly on power lines, leading to the
development of a forecast module that reached almost 60 hours ahead.

Using DLR, up to 200% of rated capacity became available under certain conditions
between 2008 and 2020. In Spain, using low cost sensors on existing lines to measure
sag, researchers found that transmission capacity increased 15% to 30% during a 3-
month experiment in 2017.


Situation in Japan
In March 2021, METI said that DLR technology can be effective in reducing the
frequency of curtailment – a situation in which power generators are asked to reduce
or shut down operations to maintain grid stability. The ministry saw this as having a
strong impact especially on local grids. DLR was also mentioned in the Sixth Basic
Energy Plan, released later that year.

Some of Japan’s largest utilities are studying the tech’s potential. Chugoku Electric,
which covers southwestern Japan, completed a one-year pilot with Fujitsu in Sept
2022 using the utility’s three transmission lines in Shimane, Yamaguchi and Hiroshima.

Devices were installed at substations to measure vibration of optical ground wires
(OPGW) for computers to acquire vibration data in milliseconds at intervals of several
meters over a length of 70 kilometers. An OPGW is a type of cable placed in the
topmost position of the transmission line to protect the cable from lightning strikes
and provide a communications path.

The data was then used to estimate wind conditions and temperatures of the
transmission line to compare with the actual measurement data, and the companies
said the two data sets were generally in accordance.

Hokkaido Electricity started a pilot in November 2022 using a DLR system developed
by Sumitomo Electric Industries to measure electric current and the temperature of a

20

transmission line combined with an existing system introduced in 2014 for the
monitoring of power flow. The companies will study how much more electricity can be
transmitted and how often curtailment can be reduced. The pilot, which runs through
October, is being conducted in the Wakkanai area in Hokkaido with DLR and weather
sensors installed at three locations.

Compatibility with wind power
In its five-year business plan in December, Tohoku Electric said it’s studying how to
manage the capacity of transmission lines using the DLR technology for more
extensive management of grid congestion to expand renewable energy.

Marubeni, a trading company, is also betting on DLR. The company signed a
distribution agreement in September 2021 with LineVision, a U.S. provider of the real-
time monitoring and analytics for grid maintenance and operation, and began a pilot
on transmission lines owned by its subsidiary, Mibugawa Electric Power.

Last October, Marubeni completed a series C funding in LineVision and signed a MoU
for a strategic partnership to expand LineVision’s business in Japan and other
countries. LineVision’s non-contact sensor can be installed without directly touching
transmission lines, allowing it to be installed quickly and safely.

DLR has another advantage – its compatibility with wind power. An increase in electric
current in a transmission line increases the chance of overheating and damaging the
line as it gets hotter, according to the Idaho National Laboratory. But an increase in
wind speed blowing at a right angle to a high-voltage line can cool the line and safely
increase the amount of current it can carry by 10% to 40%.

DLR is among many options for alleviating grid congestion such as energy storage
and demand response. As Japan gears up to expand its offshore wind capacity, which
creates the need for grid expansions and upgrades, DLR is expected to play a key role
in helping to keep the system balanced and at optimal efficiency.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Commodities
High interest rates and prices, as well as changing trade patterns, have made the global
flow of raw materials more costly to finance. The industry will have to come up with an
extra $300 to $500 billion in financing to maintain current trade levels, says a report by
McKinsey.

EU/ Wind power
This year will be difficult for the wind industry, as high costs and slow approvals for new
projects will drag on profits. For example, Danish wind turbine maker Vestas said that
the slow EU planning system and supply chain inflation is depressing profits.

Hydrogen power
ExxonMobil plans to invest $7 billion in hydrogen, carbon capture and biofuels through
2027. Its Texas facility is expected to produce 1 bcf of blue hydrogen daily. Exxon plans
to bury 98% of the CO2 emitted, about 7 million metric tons annually.

Libya/ Natural gas
The National Oil Corporation and Italy’s Eni agreed to develop gas production for
Libya’s domestic market and for export to the EU. The $8 billion “Structures A&E” is
the country’s first major project in two decades, and consists of two offshore gas fields
and a CCS facility.

Norway/ Oil and Gas
In 2022, a record-breaking 24 oil and gas projects were approved, reports Rystad
Energy. This means a total pipeline of 35 projects were approved in the last 2.5 years,
with investment totalling $43 billion. About 25 bcm of additional Norwegian gas will be
online by 2028.

Oil profits
Shell reported a record $39.9 billion profit in 2022, double last year's total and the
highest in its 115-year history. ExxonMobil had a $56 billion profit in 2022, its largest
ever. Chevron had a $36 billion profit. The White House condemned Big Oil’s profits as
“outrageous”.

Oil rigs
In 2022, offshore rig activity rose in several key regions. Global marketed jack-up
utilization increased from 87% in January to 91% in December. The Middle East
garnered all the jack-up attention, with over 60 new contracts from Saudi Aramco and
ADNOC Offshore.
Oil and gas exploration
Consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said worldwide fossil-fuel exploration in 2022 hit the

highest levels in over a decade, and the discoveries include many “higher-quality
hydrocarbons” that will require less new infrastructure and expenditures.

Philippines/ LNG
The Department of Energy approved a $67 million LNG import terminal, the country's
seventh such facility. The Philippines needs LNG imports to fuel its gas-fired power
plants that have a combined capacity of more than 3 GW.

Saudi Arabia/ Hydrogen power
The government will invest up to $267 billion on "cleaner energy", with the goal of
becoming the world’s leading exporter of clean hydrogen. The funds will go to build
production, transport lines and distribution networks to facilitate the export of clean
hydrogen.

Türkiye/ LNG
Türkiye signed an agreement with Oman to buy 1.4 bcm of LNG annually for 10 years.
Türkiye and Bulgaria also signed an agreement to transport up to 1.5 bcm of natural
gas a year for a 13-year period.
