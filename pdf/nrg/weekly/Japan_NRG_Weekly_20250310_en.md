NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


Mitsui to launch AI-driven commodity futures trading to help energy firms slash costs

(Nikkei, March 4)
•  Trading house Mitsui will launch an AI-driven commodity futures trading system by late March,
leveraging proprietary generative AI to predict market trends and conduct purchases automatically.
•  The goal is to stabilize procurement costs for energy firms and other clients, and to enhance
prediction accuracy, and to commercialize the system by 2026.
•  Initially, it will be deployed at Mitsui's global offices, such as in New York, focusing on metals and
energy resources.
•  Mitsui plans to further enhance its performance by adding commodity-specific algorithms; toward
that goal, Mitsui will host a contest this month via AI community platform Kaggle, inviting global
experts to contribute.
•  CONTEXT: While AI trading is common in equities, its application in futures is in the early stages. U.S.
agribusiness conglomerate Cargill is exploring AI for futures trading. A unique aspect of Mitsui’s
approach is the use of generative AI to automatically generate and refine trading algorithms.
•  CONTEXT: Jointly developed with Preferred Networks, the AI system has been in trial since 2021,
consistently turning a profit on trades. Its development comes as rising geopolitical risks and climate
change make the commodity markets more volatile, highlighting the need for innovative, resilient
trading strategies.



Japan approves bill to expand offshore wind to EEZ
(Government statement, March 7)
•  The govt approved a bill to amend the Renewable Energy Sea Area Utilization Act, expanding the
permitted areas for offshore wind power installations from territorial waters to the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ).
•  Under current law, developers awarded designated sea areas can hold exclusive rights for up to 30
years. To facilitate floating wind expansion, the govt will allow long-term operations in the EEZ.
•  While fixed-bottom wind turbines are standard in territorial waters, floating wind turbines will be
the primary option in the EEZ’s deeper waters.
•  CONTEXT: While offshore wind development is progressing in the northern areas of the Sea of Japan,
the country’s deep waters limit suitable locations. Projects in Europe, with much shallower coastal

waters, have widely adopted fixed-bottom turbines. This is why floating tech is still in early demo stages
globally.
• TAKEAWAY: The passage of this bill will accelerate floating wind tech development amid turmoil in the sector
related to the fixed-bottom offshore wind projects awarded to Mitsubishi Corp in the first round of public
tenders in 2021. The trading firm said it needs improved terms to complete the projects or quit the sector.
Others in the industry would see preferential treatment to Mitsubishi as a major signal that the Japanese market
is biased towards domestic, government-friendly companies. But finding a way to help Mitsubishi to complete
the round one projects without altering the tender framework will be tricky. In this context, the floating wind
space offers the government a clean slate – a chance to make a new tender system that learns from the mistakes
of the past.

First Japanese bank to withdraw from global net-zero banking alliance
(Jiji Press, Nikkei Asia, March 4)
•  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) will exit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA),
becoming the first Japanese bank to withdraw amid growing U.S. political pressure on institutions.
Nomura Holdings is also considering leaving.
•  Japan’s other megabanks, MUFG and Mizuho, are also reassessing their membership, as they
believe that staying in the alliance could pose business risks in the U.S.
•  CONTEXT: The NZBA was convened in 2021 by the UN Environment Programme finance initiative. It
seeks to support the net-zero by 2050 target and counts over 100 global financial institutions in more
than 40 countries.
•  Several U.S. lenders have withdrawn from the alliance in recent months due to the White House's
change in direction on climate action.

•  SMFG says it will continue decarbonization efforts independently and maintain its 2030 sustainable
finance targets.
• TAKEAWAY: It is no surprise that Japanese financial institutions are following those in the U.S. in leaving the
NZBA so as not to irritate the new White House. Beyond the optics, the change might not be drastic. A
European Central bank report last year said that being a signatory to the NZBA has had little impact on climate
action results. One area to watch will be any impact on green and transitional financing, and whether some
international lenders review earlier promises to stop giving loans to the oil and gas industry.



Mitsubishi Power leads Asia Pacific’s energy transition
(Asian Power, March 5)
•  Akihiro Ondo, managing director and CEO of Mitsubishi Power Asia Pacific said in an interview
that:
o  Natural gas remains essential as a bridge fuel, and Mitsubishi Power is deploying GTCC
plants to enhance efficiency and cut emissions.
o  In Thailand the company installed 10 J-Series Air Cooled (JAC) gas turbines, which can
help reduce CO2 emissions by up to 65% compared to coal.
o  The company is also accelerating hydrogen adoption. Its turbines can co-fire 30%
hydrogen, with a goal of 100% hydrogen combustion by 2030.
•  Mitsubishi Power engages in public-private partnerships and international initiatives like AZEC, and
also collaborates with leading utilities such as TNB Genco (Malaysia), EGAT (Thailand), and PLN
(Indonesia).



NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


OCCTO  announces electricity demand outlook through 2050
(OCCTO statement, Feb 28)
•  Based on the scenarios of the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI),
Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE), and Deloitte Tohmatsu
Consulting, OCCTO has accumulated several long-term power demand forecasts.
o  Two scenarios for 2040: 900 TWh and 1,100 TWh
o  Four scenarios for 2050: 950, 1,050, 1,150, and 1,250 TWh
•  To allow stakeholders to choose a model that suits their purpose and to customize the model as
needed, a breakdown will be set for each element.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The scenarios will be shared among relevant parties, including state agencies and power
companies, and will serve as a reference for the smooth implementation of long-term decarbonized
power source auctions and systematic power source development. Since their purpose is different from
that of METI's Basic Energy Plan, OCCTO's Supply Plan and Master Plan, these are developed without
necessarily assuming consistency.
•  CONTEXT: These three organizations developed scenarios that include direct air capture (DAC) and
hydrogen production, which could impact electricity demand.
• TAKEAWAY: The number of scenarios and the range of the figures are too broad to allow for deep insight, but
once again they show how uncertain future demand is in the face of AI and other processes. It’s likely that
companies and organizations will cherry pick the data that suits them when citing OCCTO forecasts.



ANRE plans to lift high-voltage price controls on Okinawa Electric
(Government statement, Feb 28)
•  ANRE will lift the high-voltage price controls on Okinawa Electric. The proportion of new power
suppliers reached 12.2% in the high-voltage sector, comparable to that on the mainland, so it was
decided to lift price controls in Okinawa’s high-voltage sector just as on the mainland.
•  The necessary measures for cancellation will be considered by the Electricity and Gas Market

Surveillance Commission (EGC).
•  CONTEXT: Retail liberalization in the Okinawa area was implemented in March 2000 for "customers
consuming 20,000 kW or more of electricity and receiving it at 60,000 V or more", and was extended to
extra-high voltage (2000 kW or more) in April 2004. But price controls remain in place for the high
and low voltage sectors. On the mainland, extra-high voltage (2000kW or more) was deregulated in
March 2000, high voltage (500kW or more) in April 2004, high voltage (50 kW or more) in April
2005, and all retail electricity, including low voltage, in April 2016.



EGC discusses restricting wholesale trading in specific areas
(Government statement, Feb 28)
•  The EGC discussed the issue of “non discrimination against buyers inside and outside of the major
power companies” when large EPCOs impose conditions that restrict supply within a specific area in
wholesale trading.
•  There are four main sales methods used in trading between power generation companies and retail
companies: (1) uniform price sales, (2) bidding, (3) brokerage, and (4) bilateral negotiations.
•  If the set value for the area supply restriction is lower than the new power company's market share,
there is no concern as long as “non discrimination” conditions are met. The exception is for uniform
price sales, which are beneficial to the company's own retail sales.
•  If the set value for the area supply restriction is higher than the new power company's market
share, depending on the sales method, the conditions will be favorable for the company's own retail
sales.
•  CONTENTS: In December, in response to emerging issues and needs, a proposal was made to "allow the
imposition of conditions such as area restrictions on a certain amount of wholesale trading as long as
they do not indiscriminately violate internal and external trading."

Osaka Gas to build third unit at Himeji gas power plant
(Company statement, March 7)
•  Osaka Gas will build a third unit at the Himeji Natural Gas Power Plant (Himeji, Hyogo Pref). This
is a JV with the Development Bank of Japan, SMFL Mirai Partners, and Mizuho Leasing. Launch is
planned for FY2030.
•  The new unit won a bid in April under the govt’s long-term decarbonization power auction. The
plant’s first and second units are already under construction and will start in 2026.
•  Power generation capacity will be 620 MW, or about 20% of Osaka Gas’s domestic thermal power
capacity. The company is considering using e-methane in the future.



FEPC urges to consider measures for coal-fired power plants phase-out

(Company statement, March 7)
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan urged the govt to consider "exceptional
measures" for phase-out of inefficient coal-fired power plants by 2030.
•  FEPC submitted its opinion as part of the public comment process on a draft report by ANRE calling
for strengthening measures to speed up the phase-out of inefficient coal power. Yet, FEPC opposed
a fixed deadline, requesting "some discretion and time flexibility" for operators.
•  It emphasized that existing thermal power plants remain essential for stable electricity supply. It
called for revisions to the capacity market and reserve power systems to ensure plants can remain
operational even at lower run rates.
•  CONTEXT: The G7 agreed to phase out coal plants without emissions reduction measures by 2035. Yet,
Japan still relies on coal for about 30% of its electricity generation and is the slowest among G7 nations
in reducing coal dependence.



ANRE launches system to charge customers refusing smart meter installation
(Government statement, Feb 28)
•  Starting 2028, ANRE will launch a system to charge customers ¥44,000 who refuse to install smart
meters.
•  CONTEXT: As of late FY2023, Japan’s total number of installed smart meters is about 81.5 million, of
which refusals were 40,000 (0.05%). In the Tokyo area, where the number of smart meters installed
was high, the number of refusals was also particularly high, at about 21,000.



Replacement work at Goi Thermal Power Station Unit 3 completed

(Company statement, March 4)
•  JERA, ENEOS, and Kyushu Electric completed replacement work at Goi Thermal Power Station.
Unit 3 began commercial operations on March 1, 2025.
•  This marks the full operation of all three units, totaling 2.3 GW. Unit 3 uses a LNG-fired gas turbine
combined cycle (GTCC) system with 780 MW capacity.

NEDO calls for hydrogen R&D projects
(Company statement, March 7)
•  NEDO welcomed participants in R&D projects to expand hydrogen adoption and strengthen
industrial competitiveness. Applications are accepted until April 7, 2025.
•  The initiative focuses on: (1) foundational technologies for fuel cells and water electrolysis; (2)
next-gen element technologies for fuel cells and hydrogen storage; and (3) commercialization and
production systems for practical applications.
•  This project runs from 2025 to 2029, aiming to accelerate innovation in hydrogen production,
storage, and fuel cell development, particularly for heavy-duty vehicles.



Nomura Real Estate and Hitachi introduce green hydrogen energy system
(Company statement, Mar 5)
•  Nomura Real Estate and Hitachi installed a green hydrogen power generation system (G-HES) at
Blue Front Shibaura in central Tokyo, in collaboration with Tokyo University’s Research Center for
Advanced Science and Technology.
•  The system produces, stores, and utilizes green hydrogen generated from 100% solar power and

operates independently of the power grid.
•  G-HES features a 9.6 kW hydrogen production unit, a 100 Nm³ hydrogen storage alloy tank, a 5 kW
fuel cell, and a storage battery.
•  CONTEXT: The system was selected for the MoE’s subsidy program in FY2023 to support the adoption
of renewable hydrogen technologies.



Breakthrough in hydrogen isotope separation
(University statement, March 3)
•  Researchers from Tohoku University, Hokkaido University, Wakayama University, and the High
Energy Accelerator Research Organization (JASRI) developed a method to separate hydrogen
isotopes (H₂ and D₂) at room temperature using a manganese complex and Kubas interaction.
•  The technique doubles the adsorption energy difference (4.2 kJ/ mol) compared to existing
materials, allowing for more efficient separation of hydrogen and deuterium gas at room
temperature.
•  Deuterium is essential for semiconductor manufacturing, and nuclear research, but production
methods require significant energy, involving hazardous substances.
•  CONTEXT: Deuterium is a rare and stable hydrogen isotope used in nuclear fusion energy. Since only
one out of 6,420 hydrogen atoms, on average, is a deuterium isotope, producing it in sufficient
quantities is difficult.



Medium-sized companies strengthen ammonia supply chain
(Nikkei, Mar 4)
•  Chugai Ro Kogyo is advancing ammonia combustion technology for industrial furnaces, particularly
in steel mills, as part of a NEDO-backed project.

Mitsubishi Corp to review plans of offshore wind projects under scrutiny
(Japan NRG, media reports, March 4)
•  Mitsubishi Corp, which made headlines last month when it said that it may scrap three large-scale
offshore wind projects awarded the first tender in 2021, is set to review the plans in question,
possibly this summer.
•  The issue was debated during an Akita Pref Assembly meeting of a special budget committee. Akita
Pref’s Gov Satake said; “There’s no need to be overly pessimistic, but it’s something that needs to be
closely monitored.”
•  Citing discussions with Mitsubishi, Satake said the trading house aims to finalize the issue this
summer. Kahoku Shimpo, a regional newspaper, said Satake cited Mitsubishi as saying a decision is

expected between summer and fall 2025.
•  CONTEXT: Mitsubishi said last month it will entirely reassess the project due to a major cost increase,
mainly due to a surge in material prices beyond initial expectations.
•  Two of the three projects that the Mitsubishi-led consortium won are planned off the Akita Pref
coast:
o  478.8 MW – off the coast of Noshiro City, Mitane Town, and Oga City
o  819 MW – off the coast of Yurihonjo City
•  Mitsubishi took a ¥52.2 billion impairment charge on its domestic offshore wind projects in the
nine-months ending in December 2024. Chubu Electric, the majority owner of C-Tech, another
member of the Mitsubishi wind consortium, also announced it took offshore wind-related
impairment losses of ¥17.9 billion.
11



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  During the meeting, lawmakers voiced a need to support local firms planning to participate in the
offshore wind projects now under review.
•  An assembly member said that following the reassessment, “we will continue to work on matching
the power generation business with local businesses.”
•  Amid the financial struggles faced by the offshore wind industry, METI is revising the tender format
to allow rising construction costs to be reflected in the electricity purchase price for future operator
selections.
• TAKEAWAY: One potential solution to help improve the economics may be for METI to switch the FIT-based
agreements to FIP. This may still not be enough to pull the project numbers into the black. It would also
encourage Round 2 winners also to ask for business plan changes to cope with rising costs. Ultimately, METI
and Mitsubishi have to find a solution that does not look like favoritism. Still, it looks like the option of leaving
Mitsubishi to deal with the issues by themselves or having them walk away from the projects altogether is not
seriously under consideration, which should be a positive for the sector as a whole.



ANRE allows zero-premium offshore wind projects to participate in capacity market

(Government statement, Feb 26)
•  ANRE proposed to allow "zero-premium projects" that bid ¥3/ kWh in the govt’s offshore wind
tender to bid in the capacity market main auction.
•  It’s expected that no FIP subsidies will be provided, except for the balancing cost equivalent, so that
even if participation in the capacity market main auction is allowed, there’ll be no problem of
double recovery of fixed costs.
•  Zero-premium projects will be allowed to participate in the capacity market during the FIP program
period, but on the condition that they waive the FIP grant equal to the balancing cost.
•  The impact on the capacity market of zero premium bids includes issues such as the handling of
supply curves and the adjustment factor for offshore wind power; but these will be improved based
on future performance data.
•  CONTEXT: Under the current system, offshore wind is also able to participate in the capacity market,
but FIT/FIP projects, including those publicly solicited under the Marine Renewable Energy Act, are not
allowed to participate during the period in which the FIT/FIP system is in place, in order to avoid
double recovery of fixed costs.

& gas applications.
•  In collaboration with the Scottish National Investment Bank, the group will invest a total of €11
million, with MISI contributing €3 million.
•  Subsea Micropiles plans to leverage its patented tech to reduce the weight of mooring anchors. This
could lower overall costs, including those related to installation vessels, shorten construction
timelines, and ensure adaptability to various seabed conditions.
•  CONTEXT: Marubeni-Itochu Steel aims to expand into Europe’s offshore wind-related market. MISI
launched in 2001 via the merger of steel business divisions spun off by trading companies, Marubeni
and Itochu, and which is equally owned by the two firms.
• TAKEAWAY: Although floating offshore wind tech in Japan is still in its early stages, with only small-scale demo

projects underway, investing in Subsea Micropiles will support the firm and its parent trading houses in

building a supply chain and related technology. While bottom-fixed offshore wind projects are still the main
vector of development, floating wind is seen as the next key driver for Japan’s renewable energy growth. The
govt is expected to open bids for floating offshore wind projects within two to three years. This requires
interested companies to develop the capabilities and infrastructure to handle floating projects in the future.

ANALYSIS

Technology Development Trends for Ammonia-fueled Ship

Maritime transportation accounts for 90% of the world's trade and about 3% of its
emissions. For Japan, it is even more vital, sustaining imports of food and fuel, and
exports of machinery on which the nation’s economy stands. Sea transport carries 99%
of Japan’s trade.
Demand for shipping has historically grown faster than the global economy, but
solutions to clean up the industry’s carbon footprint have been slow to reach fruition.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has a greenhouse gases (GHG)
reduction strategy that calls for a cut in CO2 emissions of 20-30% by 2030 (compared
with 2008 levels), 70-80% by 2040, and virtually zero by 2050. Which technologies and
fuels can help meet these targets is unclear.

In Japan, ammonia has emerged as a compelling – if challenging – alternative to heavy
fuel oil. Ammonia contains no carbon, meaning that when burned it emits no CO2. In
theory, widespread use of ammonia could enable zero-carbon voyages.

The ships Japanese companies are ordering today tend to run on LNG or LPG as lower-
emissions alternatives to conventional oil-based fuels. But within the next two-three
years, manufacturers are promising shipping technologies that will give the sector the
option to shift to ammonia.
As in power generation, the next-generation fuel of choice for shipping is yet to emerge
but recent developments suggest that ammonia-fueled shipping is picking up pace.
Japan NRG looks at the state of play in this technology segment.

Background: Why ammonia?
Burning ammonia in an engine is not as straightforward as diesel. Ammonia is
notoriously difficult to ignite – it has a low flammability, a high autoignition
temperature, and a slow flame speed. In practical terms, this means a ship’s engine
often needs a pilot fuel (typically a bit of diesel or another fuel) to get ammonia
combustion going. Even once ignited, pure ammonia flames tend to be unstable or
“flame retardant.”
The combustion chemistry of ammonia also introduces new pollutants. Unlike oil-based
fuels, ammonia doesn’t emit CO2, but it can produce nasty byproducts: nitrogen oxides
(NOx), unburnt ammonia, and nitrous oxide (N2O). NOx is a familiar air pollutant from
diesel exhaust, and unburned ammonia (ammonia “slip”) is toxic. N2O is a greenhouse
gas about 265 times more potent than CO2 on a 100-year basis.

While the technical and emissions factors are huge challenges, Japanese engineers have
been working to address them on multiple fronts. These include designing dual-fuel
engines (i.e. similar to the co-firing strategy in power generation), and introducing
equipment such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to scrub NOx from ship
exhaust. Focus on new safety systems is pushing R&D to come up with extra
containment and detection, as well as materials that are more resistant to ammonia’s
corrosiveness.
Major R&D projects in ammonia-fueled shipping
Under the Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), an inter-ministerial research
and development project led by the Cabinet Office from FY2014 to FY2018, the
18



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

National Institute of Maritime, Port and Aviation Technology (MPAT) and JEF
Engineering each conducted basic research on the combustion of ammonia in marine
diesel engines.
The “Green Innovation Fund Project” was launched in FY2021, and as part of the “Next-
generation Ship Development” project, the “Development of ammonia-fueled ships” is
held in parallel with the development of hydrogen-fueled ships. (See Table)

The “development of ships with ammonia-fueled domestic engines” will be conducted
jointly by Nippon Yusen (NYK), Japan Engine Corp (J-ENG), IHI Power Systems, and
Nihon Shipyard (NSY). The domestic-use tugboat was converted from a NYK LNG-
fueled ship and equipped with an engine (1600 kW) developed by IHI Power Systems,
and was completed in August 2024.

For ocean-going ammonia-fueled ships, J-ENG is in charge of developing the main
engine (8000 kW) and IHI Engine – the auxiliary engine (1300 kW). NYS will build the
first one at the shipyard of its parent company, Japan Marine United (JMU), with
completion scheduled for November 2026.
The R&D and rollout of ammonia-fueled ships is spearheaded by a group consisting of
trading house Itochu, J-ENG, Mitsui E&S, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line), and NS
United Kaiun Kaisha. The aim is to introduce ammonia-fueled ships into ports by 2028.
This would allow Japan to take global leadership in the technology, able to offer new
propulsion systems and hulls specific to ammonia use.

While European shippers and governments are pushing ahead with the introduction of
methanol-fueled shipping, Japan hopes to forge ahead with ammonia to maintain the
country’s maritime industrial strength in the age of zero-emission ships. Both methanol
and ammonia are so-called hydrogen carriers.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) is
promoting the development of ammonia direct combustion engines through its own
"Transport Technology Development Promotion System," with JFE Engineering
conducting "Research on the Expansion of Ammonia Fuel Applications in Ships" and
Mitsui E&S conducting "Research on the Expansion of Ammonia Fuel Applications in
Ships" in FY2023-2024.

In addition, in January, MLIT, in cooperation with MoE, announced the winners for the
"Zero-Emission Ship Construction Promotion Project" that aims to promote the
introduction of these ships to the market, reduce CO2 emissions, strengthen industrial
competitiveness and promote economic growth by supporting the development of
production facilities and other equipment, as well as to establish a domestic supply
system for these ships. This includes J-ENG and Daihatsu Diesel as developers of
ammonia fuel engines.
Breakthroughs
The biggest problem with ammonia-fueled engines is their flammability, but J-ENG has
achieved advanced combustion control by injecting ammonia fuel between the highly
flammable pilot fuel and post fuel injection using its unique "layered injection
technology," which makes it possible to optimize the ammonia co-firing ratio and
suppress the generation of nitrous oxide.

To reduce the amount of CO2 emitted by ammonia-fueled engines to an absolute
minimum, IHI Power Systems increased the proportion of ammonia fuel in the test,
achieving a maximum co-firing rate of 95%. In addition, the GHG reduction rate for
ammonia combustion is more than 90% compared to heavy fuel oil.

Other achievements include the realization of ammonia operation performance in
response to load fluctuations, as well as the confirmation of zero ammonia leakage from
the actual engine during operation and after shutdown. This means that the problems
associated with the use of ammonia as a fuel have been overcome. As a result, ClassNK
issued the world's first type approval for an ammonia-fueled engine.
In February, ClassNK also issued an approval in Principle (AiP) to NYK Line and
Seatrium Ltd for the design of an ammonia-fueled bunkering vessel slated for use in
Singapore. When built it will become the world’s first ammonia-fueled bunkering vessel.

Conclusion
Ammonia is not the only alternative vying for the maritime shipping industry’s future.
Hydrogen is an obvious contender, able to be used in fuel cells or combusted in engines,
yielding only water. A few demonstration vessels are testing hydrogen fuel cells, but
storing enough hydrogen onboard an ocean-going ship is a formidable challenge –
liquid hydrogen needs to be kept at –253°C, and even then it contains only about one-
third the energy per volume of LNG. In practice a ship would need huge, heavily
insulated tanks for hydrogen, eating into cargo space.
Biofuel (biodiesel) is a more practical fuel than hydrogen and ammonia because it has
the advantage that existing diesel engines can be used without major modifications.
However, it is still in the development stage, and companies such as NYK are still
conducting test runs.

To meet the IMO's upcoming greenhouse gas reduction targets, shipping companies
must act soon. Furthermore, the urgency to reduce CO2 from the transportation of
goods and the broader supply chain will increase from late FY2027, when large
companies will be required to disclose sustainability information.
Although both hydrogen and ammonia are promising decarbonized fuels, fuel supply
and cost, as well as technology development, will decide which becomes the more
popular. At present, Japan is promoting both fuels equally. Ammonia, however, is
thought to have the edge in terms of storage and transportation as a marine fuel.

ANALYSIS

Japan Bets on Next-gen Solar Power Tech as Key Driver for Clean Energy
While solar energy’s global momentum has accelerated, the sector development in
Japan has been strained in recent years due to land, cost and local community issues.
New installations in Japan dropped to only about 1.5% of the world’s total in FY2023,
compared to 9.5% in FY2016.

Still, several factors suggest the declines in the Japanese market have peaked, and a
revival in the pace of new development will follow. One of the drivers will be the
underutilized rooftop solar market – for residential, public and industrial buildings.
Another, a greater embrace of hybrid business models, such as agri-solar. On top of
that, a nascent shift in solar technologies and materials is touted as the next cost-
efficiency opportunity.
Globally, solar PV now provides 6% of electricity. After a 68-year climb to reach 1 TW,
solar doubled that capacity within two years and is projected to hit 8 TW installed by
2030, according to Global Solar Council figures. Within this decade, solar power
generation is forecast to take a 12% share of the global electricity mix aided by growth
trends also for batteries and storage.

In Japan, solar’s share hovers at around 10% of the mix, but the Cabinet’s newly
approved Basic Energy Plan targets a 20–29% share by 2040. While challenges for
embracing more solar power remain, especially in terms of grid connections and
balancing, a rise in corporate interest in Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs) and steps
towards better integration of solar PVs with storage and public or industrial facilities are
starting to pay dividends.
Japan NRG takes a look at some of the latest trends in the sector, starting with a
regulation that will take effect this April.

Resurgence of solar power
Since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Japan has become one of the top five solar energy
markets. Yet, in recent years, large-scale wind power projects have attracted more
investor attention as solar tariffs dropped to single-digit levels in terms of yen per
kilowatt-hour. Also, the difficulty in accessing new land, among other factors, has put
the brakes on project development pipelines.
With the wind sector yet to navigate its own development challenges, government
attention is starting to shift to how it can revive momentum in the renewables space
overall.

Starting April 1, new detached houses in Tokyo will be required to install solar power
systems. This regulation, affecting about 50 developers and new residential buildings
with a total floor area of less than 2,000 square meters, supports Japan’s broader goal
of sourcing 50% of its energy from renewables by 2040; Tokyo aims to achieve this by
2030.

A similar ordinance is already in place in Kyoto, which mandates the installation of PV
power systems or other renewable energy equipment for new or expanded buildings
with total floor areas between 300 and 2,000 square meters. In return, the city offers
subsidies to cover the installation costs.

Other local authorities are considering similar measures, but in the case of Fukuoka
City, the thinking is evolving to combine the rooftop drive with a desire to nurture new
technologies.
Fukuoka has announced plans to install perovskite solar cells (PSC) on a public
building’s exterior walls, the first of its kind in Japan. This project is a collaboration
with Sekisui Chemical, one of the leading manufacturers of PSC and one of the
Japanese firms that has vowed to bring the technology to commercial-scale mass
production in the next year or so.

Sekisui will monitor the waterproof performance and power generation efficiency of the
film-type perovskite system installed in Fukuoka and make a final evaluation by April
2026.

Separately, Fukuoka City will also install PSC on the roof of the local Kashii-hama
Elementary School’s gymnasium before April 2025. This system will cover 200 square
meters with an output of 20 kW, making it the largest building-mounted installation of
its kind in Japan. Further, the city has allocated ¥2.1 billion in its FY2025 initial budget
to introduce PSC at three other municipal facilities.
Perovskites promises
Expectations for PSC among Japanese officials are high with METI banking on the
home-grown tech to be one of the catalysts for the domestic green capacity rollout.
Curiously, the 20-40 GW target for PSC installations by 2040 is not too dissimilar to the
30-45 GW targets put on offshore wind by the same timeframe. Strong progress in both
sectors will be needed if the country is to meet its 73% emissions reduction by the end
of the next decade.

One advantage that Japan has in bringing down the cost of PSC is its iodine supply. The
country controls 30% of global iodine production, a key material in perovskite cells,
second only to Chile. This positions Japan to develop a secure domestic supply chain
and reduce reliance on foreign imports.

There’s also progress in making cheaper solar cell components. Silver paste currently
accounts for nearly 30% of the material cost in solar cells. Material Concept, a startup
from Tohoku University in Sendai, wants to offer a similar product made from copper,
which could bring down the price by half.
Copper paste is used as a wiring material in solar cells and, like silver, has high
conductivity. It was previously unsuitable due to its tendency to bond with silicon, but
Material Concept has developed a proprietary alcohol-based solution that solves the
issue.

With an investment of several hundred million yen in production facilities at its
university headquarters, Material Concept plans to expand its production capacity from
10 kg/ month to 4 tons/ month. The startup seeks to raise ¥340 million through a third-
party allotment of shares to finance the expanded production facilities, which will lower
manufacturing expenses through scale.
Efficiency breakthroughs
Perovskite technology faces hurdles such as durability and scalability, but research is
making strides. In December 2024, a research team from Kyoto University and Oxford
University published a paper in Nature on improving the performance of perovskite
solar cells. The study utilizes a method called the "tandem structure," which involves
layering multiple perovskite crystal layers with different properties. This approach
achieved a maximum conversion efficiency of 29.7%, surpassing the conventional range
of 24 – 27%.

In the residential solar power sector, the highest conversion efficiency is currently
around 22.5% (as of 2024). This makes the 29% efficiency mark a groundbreaking
achievement.
The doubling of PSC layers or their combination with traditional silicon PVs (known as
the tandem structure) will be one of the main ways the solar sector will move forward
and Japan is in a position to lead the global industry in this tech, Xavier Daval, a
director at the Global Solar Council (GSC) told the Renewable Energy Institute (REI)
forum in Tokyo last week.

The smaller scale of PSC at this moment could also be an opportunity to apply the tech
to narrow spaces. For example, Tokyo’s new rooftop regulation is for buildings with
roof areas smaller than 20 square meters or those with structural limitations, but the
lightweight, film-thin properties of PSC broaden its potential application.
Japan’s long-term solar outlook
Commercialization of next-gen technologies isn’t a given. Even in China, which almost
entirely dominates the current solar PV technologies, full-scale mass production of PSC
has not yet been achieved. Chinese firms like DaZheng Micro-Nano Technology are
expected to move to large-scale PSC output in 2025. Japanese manufacturers, including
Toshiba, Sekisui Chemical, and Panasonic, are expected to follow suit between 2025
and 2026.

Aware of the challenges in commercializing next-gen solar tech in the face of China’s
dominance in current technologies and state resources, METI is focusing on directing its
own support to domestic players who could make up a Japanese PSC supply chain.
Around ¥55 billion was allocated for this task in the FY2024 budget, with more funds
expected this year.

A PSC-specific tariff, like a FIT, will also be made available to kickstart domestic
projects since perovskite cells are expected to be more costly than traditional silicon-
based panels.
These are as yet small steps towards a Japanese solar revival from a manufacturing and
an installation standpoint. But they are genuine efforts to move forward. As global
competition intensifies, innovation and regulatory support will determine whether
Japan can be a leader in the next-generation of solar technology.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Offshore wind
Novocastrian Wind Pty, a partnership between Equinor and Oceanex Energy, received
the feasibility licence for their planned offshore wind farm project for the Hunter
offshore wind area. The feasibility licence is granted for up to seven years and
Novocastrian Wind must use this time to obtain all necessary approvals.
Australia / Renewables
Australia has approved three renewable energy projects in New South Wales with a
total capacity of over 2.4 GW. The projects include the 1.33 GW Liverpool Range Wind
Farm near Coolah, within the Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone; the 700
MW Spicers Creek Wind Farm Project near Gulgong, also within the Central West Orana
Renewable Energy Zone; and the 372 MW Hills of Gold Wind Farm near Nundle.
China / Energy imports
Energy imports fell at the start of 2025, after last year’s record shipments of coal and
gas created an overhang of supply and demand for oil continued to ease. Crude oil
imports fell 5% YoY in January and February to 83.85 Mt as buyers sought alternative
supplies after the U.S. tightened sanctions on Russian and Iranian cargoes.

China / Renewables
China’s newly installed renewable energy capacity accounted for 86% of its total new
additions in 2024. The National Energy Administration said the cumulative installed
capacity of renewable energy made up a record high of 56% of China’s total capacity.
India / Renewables
In 2024, India issued a record-high of 73 GW of utility-scale renewable energy capacity,
a major rise from 58 GW in 2023, reported the Institute for Energy Economics and
Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research & Analytics.

India / Solar power
Solar is expected to continue dominating India's renewable energy generation, with
about 32.3 GW of new capacity to be added in 2025. According to JMK Research, this
will include 22.8 GW from utility-scale, 7.5 GW from rooftop solar, and 2 GW from off-
grid components.
Indonesia / Oil refinery
Indonesia plans a massive $12.5 billion refinery project, aiming to cut imports, boost
energy security, and improve refining muscle. The 531,500 bpd facility will be one of
the largest in SE Asia.

Singapore / Power plant
Keppel Core Infrastructure Fund (KCIF) acquired a 39% stake in the Keppel Merlimau
Cogen Plant (KMC), its first power sector asset. Keppel Infrastructure Trust will
continue to hold 51% of KMC, with the remaining 10% retained by Keppel Ltd.

Southeast Asia / Renewables
A greenfield renewable energy platform formed by Sustainable Asia Renewable Assets,
which is a JV of British International Investment, Dutch development bank FMO, and
Swiss investment company SUSI Partners, could invest as much as $700 million to build
