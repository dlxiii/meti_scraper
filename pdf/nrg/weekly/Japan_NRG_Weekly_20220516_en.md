NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Japan to create $155 bln decarbonization fund for the grid
(Asia Nikkei, May 14)
•  The government plans to create a ¥20 trillion ($155 billion) fund to promote investment in new
power grid technology, energy-saving homes and other tech meant to shrink the country's carbon
footprint.
•  Policymakers will seek to finance these investments with new sources of revenue, including a

carbon tax and utility charges.
•  The fund will help chemical plants, steel mills and other big industrial emitters switch to less
carbon-intensive processes, and support supply chains for fossil fuel alternatives like hydrogen and
ammonia. It will back production of car and storage batteries.
• TAKEAWAY: PM Kishida is expected to unveil his clean energy strategy sometime in June or July. These news
items appear to be leaks from parts of the strategy.

• Under previous PM Suga, Japan set up the Green Innovation Fund, a ¥2 trillion, 10-year initiative that was
meant to help fund the R&D behind the energy transition. It is administered by NEDO. This new fund appears
to be 10 times larger and focused on bringing the R&D to life in more commercial-size projects. The focus on
the grid should also be a very positive development.



Upper House passes Economic Security Act
(Parliament update, May 11)
•  The House of Councilors passed the Economic Security Act, allowing the government to oversee
procurement of power utilities and other basic service providers, and to protect the supply chain of
critical materials such as rare earths and semiconductors. Within the next nine months, the
government will issue ordinances to define the scope of legal oversight and critical materials.
• TAKEAWAY: The measure will not only spur demand for locally recycled machineries and scrap, but also

mergers and acquisitions of licensed waste-processing companies by trading houses that’ll be forced to scale
down business with China.
• Immediate impact on Chinese rare earth trading will be limited as various governments have been strictly

monitoring trade flows in the past decade.


Japan to launch first exchange for carbon emissions trading
(Asia Nikkei, May 13)
•  Japan Exchange Group together with METI, will establish the nation's first market for trading
carbon dioxide emissions. It will be hosted inside the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), starting with a
trial in September. Full-scale operation would start from around April 2023.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan NRG reported this in the March 28, 2022 issue. Please check the Analysis section for all the

details.

Industry agrees on carbon accounting standard
(Nikkei, May 11)
•  A group of 74 Japanese companies, including NEC, Honda and Toshiba, have agreed to
standardize CO2 emissions reporting.

•  This will make it easier to calculate carbon emissions over the entire supply chain; the scheme will
commence in July.
•  These companies are considering alliances with European carbon monitoring groups.


Environment Ministry to subsidize SAF production from waste oil

(MoE statement, May 11)
•  The MoE held an online tutorial of a new program for development of technologies to make
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from waste oil and biomass The ministry plans to finance 20-30% of
manpower, equipment purchases and other development costs. Applications close on May 30.
•  CONTEXT: Companies eyeing SAF production have eyed used cooking oil and palm oil, alarming
renewable operators and animal feed manufacturers that use the oil. The program aims to develop
a new sustainable fuel supply chain using waste oil that’s not been recovered efficiently. One

option is using cooking oil that can’t be used for animal feed, and another is oil found in industrial
wastewater.


“National team” to support Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant
(Japan NRG, May 10)
•  A “national team” of 400 engineers from power utilities, plant manufacturers and construction

firms has formed to support construction of the Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant, a Japan
Nuclear Fuel Ltd official reported to METI. The utilities are JNFL shareholders and customers.
•  The plant, scheduled for completion this year, will be Japan’s first commercial nuclear fuel
reprocessing facility. It will produce mixed oxide (MOX) plutonium fuel. Completion was delayed
due to radioactive glass canister problems in 2007.
•  The 400 external supporters are divided into safety and regulatory compliance teams. Utilities have
also sent experts to train the on-site staff and to update safety plans to help clear regulatory

reviews.
•  CONTEXT: The smooth launch of Rokkasho is the first major step in the national nuclear fuel
recycling plan. Its failure to clear safety standards will impact Japan’s nuclear energy scenario,
which include launch of pluthermal generation by the power utilities, expansion of nuclear fuel
storage capacity and reprocessing of MOX fuel.
• TAKEAWAY: See this week’s Analysis section for a detailed report on how the nuclear waste issue will affect

the restart of Japan’s Reactors.


METI asks banks to lower interest rates to support crude-hit businesses

(METI statement, May 11)
•  METI has asked banks to lower interest rates and provide low or zero interest loans to small and
middle size enterprises hit by crude oil price rise. The ministry also asked for flexibility in lending
terms.

Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association proposes new panel recycling framework
(Japan NRG, May 12)
•  The Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association proposed a panel recycling framework that involves
solar panel importer and suppliers, power operators, waste collector and treatment businesses,

local governments, and the national government. JPEA was speaking at a multi-ministry panel for
resolving renewables and community conflicts. Under present recycling regulations, waste
processing companies bear reporting responsibilities to municipalities. METI and MoE run separate
subsidy programs to develop recycling technologies.
•  Over half of the glass in the panels contain antimony, a toxic element that can’t be transported
outside approved areas. Antimony is also found in PC and flat panel displays, but cost-efficient and

safe technologies to separate the element from waste have not been developed. Antimony, like
rare earths, is a critical resource whose reserves are concentrated in China.
• TAKEAWAY: See also “As a Leader in Solar, Japan Seeks Solutions to Recycle And to Prolong PV Panel
Lifespan” in the March 28 issue of Japan NRG.



Japan CCS transfers geographical data to JOGMEC for wider public access
(Japan NRG, May 11)
•  Japan CCS, a joint venture of oil and gas upstreamers conducting geophysical surveys, transferred
its proprietary data to state-run Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation for wider access to
companies planning carbon capture operations.
•  Surveys will increase with JOGMEC launching CCS exploration in 2023.

•  CONTEXT: METI says CCS feasibility studies need to start in 2023, at the latest, to be operational
in 2030. CCS demand is forecast at 120-140 million tons/year, according to its interim report on
long term CCS strategy.


ENEOS and J-Power to partner on carbon capture and storage (CCS)

(SankeiBiz, May 13)
•  ENEOS and J-Power will implement carbon capture and storage on an industrial level.
•  The two companies are surveying sites in West Japan suitable for CO2 sequestration, and aim to
begin commercial operations in 2030. A final investment decision on the project is expected
around 2026.
•  The project will allow storage of CO2 recovered from oil refineries and thermal power stations

operated by the two companies.
• TAKEAWA: This is an attempt to create Japan’s first commercial scale carbon capture and storage facility,
building on the testing done at the Tomakomai CCS trial project, in which both ENEOS and J-Power are
shareholders. If successful, demand will be strong and run far beyond the emissions of the two companies.

• ENEOS and J-Power are also working on a joint project to extract hydrogen from biomass and store CO2
byproduct underground.

o  Onoda said JERA will continue to seek flexible procurement of LNG.



Solar panels to be mandatory for Tokyo houses
(Tokyo Shimbun, May 12)
•  A committee appointed by the Tokyo Metropolitan government tabled a report that called for
solar panels to be mandatory on all new houses.

•  The recommendations will probably be law in 2022/23, pending residents’ feedback.
•  The obligation to fit panels will rest with construction companies, rather than buyers.
•  With a target more ambitious than the national government, Tokyo Governor Koike Yuriko
pledged to reduce Tokyo’s GHG emissions by 2030 to under 50% of 2000 levels.

Shipper Mitsui OSK and Trafigura to partner in biodiesel fuel supply
(New Energy Business News, May 12)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) and trading firm Trafigura agreed to jointly study the establishment of a

biodiesel fuel supply chain at auxiliary oil ports around the world.
•  The aim is initially to supply ships operated by MOL’s Singapore unit MOL Chemical Tankers.
•  The two parties already tested biodiesel fuel on MOL’s chemical tanker "NISEKO GALAXY" earlier
this year. This kind of fuel can be used without changing the specifications of a ship's existing
diesel engine, and by blending it with conventional marine fuel oil at a ratio of approximately 30%.
It is said to cut emissions by about a quarter.




Japanese group teams up to improve district cooling & heating with AI
(New Energy Business News, May 10)
•  AI algorithm/product developer Araya, Sumitomo Corporation Machinex, Toho Gas, Nikken
Sekkei, and Nikken Sekkei Research Institute have developed AI Chirei, a system that uses AI to
solve problems in district heating and cooling management.
•  The AI starts demonstration tests at a district in Nagoya city in May.

•  CONTEXT: District heating and cooling in Japan has been introduced since the 1970s as a
measure against air pollution caused by the country's rapid economic growth, and currently there
are 133 such facilities in Japan. However, it is difficult even for experienced operators to accurately
predict conditions at the customer side and operate heat sources, so CO2 emissions reduction
through renovation, including review of operation methods, is essential.




Joyo Bank to invest in renewables
(Nikkei, May 13)
•  Joyo Bank will open a subsidiary to acquire solar farms and other renewable capacity.
•  The new company, Joyo Green Energy, will invest in generation in Ibaraki Prefecture.
•  In the mid-to-long-term this will also include biomass projects.

WAR IN UKRAINE:
PM Kishida says Japan preparing to cut Russian oil imports
(NHK, May 9)
o  Commenting on a recent G7 pledge to suspend or phase-out imports of Russian oil, PM

Kishida said the government will begin discussing when to start reducing imports.
o  The government will take into account current import levels.
o  However, when asked about Japan’s stakes in the Sakhalin I and Sakhalin II projects, the
PM said the government’s position to keep these remains unchanged.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Idemitsu to suspend Russian oil and coal exports

(NHK, May 10)
o  Idemitsu CEO Kito Shun’ichi said the company will stop Russian coal and oil imports in
line with the government's embargo.
o  Russian oil currently accounts for around 4% of Idemitsu’s total imports.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan to ban exports of catalysts for oil refining, green hydrogen to Russia

(METI statement, May 13)
o  Effective May 20, Japan will ban exports of catalysts for oil refining, green hydrogen fuel,
solar module manufacturing equipment, high-tech alloys used for weapons,
semiconductor raw materials and more.
o  CONTEXT: Gray or blue hydrogen and ammonia exports will not be banned.
• TAKEAWAY: While in principle banning Russian oil imports, Japan will keep its interests in hydrocarbon
developments there. That might seem like a contradiction, but oil purchase contracts elsewhere are easy to

draw up with other suppliers in the giant global oil market. Having rights to develop hydrocarbon reserves,
which is what Japan has in the Sakhalin I and II projects, is much more complex and expensive to procure.
Such rights are, in theory, a guarantee of energy security and therefore worth more than a commercial
procurement deal.

• The other great consideration is what happens to the Russian rights should Japan relinquish them. After all,
over decades Japan provided billions of dollars in financing and technological know-how to help bring
Sakhalin projects online. This is no mean feat when you consider that oil wells at Sakhalin I, for example, are
some of the longest in the world, in one case spanning 15 kilometers. Giving up the rights would potentially
pass on the technology and ready-made production deposits to trade rival China for a pittance. Even if Japan
cannot benefit from the oil and gas produced in Sakhalin, it will likely want to hold onto the rights to prevent

them from becoming a big plus for China.

ANALYSIS

BY MASUTOMO TAKEHIRO

Moment of Truth Nears for Japan’s Nuclear Waste Issue
With nuclear power generation gaining renewed attention in the race to decarbonize
the energy sector, and the war in Ukraine causing energy prices to skyrocket, Japan is
giving serious consideration to restarting its dormant nuclear power fleet.

Prime Minister Kishida has made clear his willingness to restart nuclear power plants,
saying on April 26: "We must pursue how far we can go in restarting reactors within
the current framework.” Before a final decision is made, however, the fundamental
question of how to manage nuclear waste needs to be resolved. Will it be recycled or
disposed of entirely?

Prior to the 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, nuclear power generation was a
strategic priority, accounting for roughly 30% of Japan’s total electricity. The industry
envisioned creating a system for recycling used fuel, but progress in this direction was
slow. Meanwhile, used fuel rods piled up in short-term storage, threatening one day
to reach capacity.

After the 2011 disaster, the country’s entire nuclear fleet was shut down. Even a
decade on, of the remaining 33 nuclear reactors classified as operable only 10 have
restarted. Today, just four units are currently online due to maintenance and facility
upgrade works.

With few reactors in operation, the issue of what to do with used nuclear fuel and
other waste receded into the background. Should restarts become a reality, however,
the government will need to tackle this issue sooner rather than later.


MOX’s mojo still uncertain
There are two main approaches to spent nuclear fuel. One is sealing it inside safe
containers, such as glass and cement, and stored out of harm’s way. Another view
sees spent fuel as a resource to create new fuel rods since the vast majority of the
energy potential remains untapped.

While most western countries have adopted the former approach, the latter vision for
a circular nuclear economy is supported by just a handful of countries. Japan is one of
them.

Utilizing recycled uranium, however, requires different technology to the one regularly
deployed in Japan and elsewhere. For many years, building fast or breeder reactors
was considered the best option. These units, as the name suggests, are theoretically
able to unlock more of the energy potential of uranium than regular reactors, creating
more energy than they draw.

No country, however, has succeeded in building an economic and efficient fast
reactor. In 2016, the Japanese government decided to close its commercial-scale
Monju fast nuclear reactor facility despite it barely operating after a long series of
mishaps.

Japan’s nuclear strategy is built on the idea that nuclear fuel can be recycled. There
are other ways to recycle nuclear fuel. One involves a series of steps including the
extraction of uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel and blending these
components into a new so-called mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. Some regular nuclear
reactors, with modifications, can run on MOX fuel.

To date, Japan has upgraded four of its reactors to be pluthermal. In other words, to
run on MOX fuel that has a higher plutonium component. Many more units were due
to be upgraded to run on MOX fuel, but before that Japan decided to set up its own
spent fuel recycling facility.

This is where the Rokkasho Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Facility in Aomori Prefecture
comes in. Originally planned to open in 1997, the project has been delayed 25 years
due to technical issues and additional construction work required by stricter
regulations.

The sunk costs are huge, with construction alone already reaching ¥3 trillion. Industry
experts believe the final cost will amount to ¥14.4 trillion, making MOX more
expensive than conventional fuel. In the meantime, Japan has outsourced the
reprocessing task, mainly to Britain and France.

MOX’s main selling point is recycling spent fuel, thus lessening the volume of nuclear
waste that needs to be stored. Across Japan, 19,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel sit in
swim pool-like facilities inside nuclear power plants. This is believed to be 80% of the
total available storage capacity.

Old promises
In 1995, Rokkasho agreed with nuclear utilities to start taking used fuel from their
storage pools after 30 to 50 years. While Rokkasho’s launch has been delayed, the
facility has about two decades to collect all the spent fuel rods if it is to honor those

contracts. Given the plant’s current capacity, Rokkasho’s operator, Japan Nuclear Fuel
Ltd., will struggle to process all of the envisaged volumes in that timeframe.

The issue flared up in the political arena last year during the LDP presidential election,
a de facto race to pick the country's next leader. PM Kishida seized the opportunity,
defeating Kono Taro, who had promised to abandon nuclear fuel recycling. Kishida!s
newly-established government has reiterated the nation’s commitment to recycling.

The support of local government is also crucial. The village of Rokkasho has a mayoral
election in June. If politicians that support the recycling project are defeated, the
country’s ability to keep its nuclear recycling vision alive may be quashed. That would
accelerate the need to find a final site for direct nuclear waste disposal.


Remote villages volunteer for site selection
The government and power companies have plans to bury high-level radioactive
waste underground at depths of 300 meters or more. The perennial issue has been:
Where? The nuclear industry published standards for such a site in 2000. This was
followed by a survey and a map identifying potentially suitable geological areas,
published in 2017.

In 2020, two remote Hokkaido municipalities — Suttsu Town and Kamoenai Village —
self-nominated as sites for the final disposal of high-level nuclear waste. This set off a
two-year process of gathering preliminary data to confirm location suitability. That
process is almost complete. Interestingly, both localities held elections in the last year,
with project proponents winning.

Still, this is just the start. Selection of a final disposal site requires 20 years of
geological and other investigation, as well as another 10 years for safety review and
construction. It’s not clear if either Suttsu and Kamoenai will move to the process’
second phase (overview survey to examine the strata and bedrock) or third phase
(detailed survey to set up an underground research facility).

Regional politics is one factor contributing to the uncertainty. While the idea has
support at the locality level, it would need support from the regional governor.
Current holder of that post, Suzuki Masanao, has expressed opposition to such
developments. How future leaders of the two localities will act is also uncertain.

Separately, in Horonobe, another Hokkaido town, a deep geological survey is also
underway. Three years ago, the utilities-funded-Nuclear Waste Management
Organization (NUMO) said that an investigation of disposal technology to bury nuclear
waste underground would be extended to 2028.

Last year, NUMO unveiled plans to drill to 500 meters underground, from the current
300 meters. Locals are concerned that testing will eventually lead to their location
being asked to become the final disposal site.

What’s more, aside from spent fuel, Japan will soon have much more nuclear waste
that needs storing. The decommissioning of Japan’s older reactors is expected to
begin in the mid-2020s, which could result in about 480,000 tons of low-level
radioactive waste. The Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant is another source of nuclear waste
that currently has no home or defined disposal strategy.

Send nuclear waste abroad?
According to international treaties, radioactive waste should be disposed of in the
country of generation. But Japan plans to deregulate waste disposal. Some large
equipment that comes out of the decommissioning process, categorized as low-level
nuclear waste, will be permitted for outsourcing to overseas disposal companies.

Last September, Asahi reported that this deregulation specifically applies to three
types of equipment: steam generators, feed-water heaters and nuclear fuel storing
and shipping casks. According to another report by Mainichi, in April 2020 a senior
official at the U.S. Department of Energy asked METI to review Japanese regulations
that prohibit disposal outside Japan.

During the conversation, the officer mentioned Utah-based Energy Solutions, the
world's largest nuclear waste disposal company. Apart from this, in 2019-2020 Canada
also considered accepting Japanese nuclear waste. The New Energy Basic Plan,
revised last October, clearly indicates that the government favors being able to move
some low-level nuclear waste abroad, and change in regulation is in the offing.

For all the above, Japan!s path for nuclear fuel recycling and a final disposal site hasn’t
become clearer over the past few years. Yet, the clock is ticking. In the end, political
decisions always dictate Japan!s nuclear policy. The summer elections contested by
PM Kishida may decide more than just the make-up of the upper house of parliament.
They may decide the fate of the broader nuclear energy complex.

Creating the Asian Definition of a “Green” Investment:
Japan Leads a New Regional Initiative

Going “green” means different things to governments and businesses around the
world. The latest policy developments in Japan confirm that it and its Southeast Asian
allies’ vision of energy transition pathways diverge markedly from those animating
Brussels, London and Washington.

Japan set the scene with a new international platform. At the end of April, Tokyo
hosted the first Asia Green Growth Partnership Ministerial Meeting (AGGPM) Public-
Private Forum. The event included speeches by energy-related officials from the 10
member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as
Japan. It also featured announcements of ambitious business partnerships between
Japanese and ASEAN companies in the fields of carbon capture and storage,
ammonia, hydrogen and renewable energy.

But possibly the most impactful aspect of the Forum was the launch of the Asian
Transition Finance Study Group’s (ATFSG) mid-term report on transition pathways.
This grouping of Asian and global commercial banks is much more than another
industry initiative. Led by Japan’s biggest financial player, MUFG, the Group is
strongly backed by Japanese government agencies and has direct input from key
stakeholders in the ASEAN. That includes the ASEAN Taxonomy Board and the
Sustainable Finance Institute Asia.

The Group’s report, which is due to be followed by a final version in October, is
essentially an outline of decarbonization strategies for Asia. Japan and its ASEAN
partners make it clear they seek pragmatic and appropriate solutions for their region
while also respecting global climate goals reflected in the Paris Agreement.


What the report represents
Global warming is accelerating, and the World Meteorological Association
warns we have a 50% risk of breaching 1.5 degrees within the next 5 years. Asia will
powerfully shape what happens in those years and beyond, as it represents 60% of
the global population, over half of all emissions, and 60% of global growth through to
2030.

Despite these big numbers, most countries in Asia have not set out specific
decarbonization pathways, in contrast with the EU. Yet even the EU’s net-zero
pathways are already complicated by pitfalls and potholes, as evinced by the crisis
concerning Russia.

So the ATFSG’s work is crucial. Its report explicitly points to the EU’s much higher
level of economic development and starkly different resource endowments. The

ATFSG is committed to building on the European experience, but melds questions of
sustainability with an emphasis on energy security, reliability of supply, and
affordability. The result, judging by the mid-term report, will be decarbonization
roadmaps quite unlike Europe’s.


Terms of Investment
Another reason the ATFSG cannot be ignored is its work on a regional green
taxonomy. A taxonomy is essentially a rulebook to guide investments toward
technologies that are deemed in line with climate goals, or simply “green”.

To some, this effort might seem superfluous, since the EU has already drafted such a
green taxonomy. Its scope extends from climate mitigation and adaptation, through
to the circular economy, and on into protecting and restoring biodiversity and
ecosystems. For many, the EU’s taxonomy seemed on the cusp of becoming the
essential manual for decarbonization, but it’s now under critical scrutiny after
European Commission pragmatists added nuclear and low-emissions natural gas to
the “green” list. This provoked fierce opposition that portends a very hot summer in
the European Parliament.

However the EU’s internal debate concludes, Japan has been concerned that
Europe’s taxonomy rules and related regulation won’t fit Asia realities. Asian partners
generally agree that allowing EU definitions of “green” to become the global
standard would hinder Asia’s economic development. Japanese policymakers have
built on this sentiment and institutionalized work towards creating a taxonomy specific
to Asia.

Japan’s initiative is not as rebellious as it sounds. After all, the EU’s taxonomy was only
one of at least 26 in place or under development as of March 2022, according to
Climate Bonds. Each taxonomy contains its own details on defining sustainable
investment across the power, transport, mining and other sectors.

Proliferation of Green Taxonomies

Among the proliferating taxonomies, there are also attempts at harmonization. The
EU and China, for example, seek to synchronize their respective approaches through a
Common Ground Taxonomy. This initiative is complicated by quite dissimilar rules,
such as those regarding social standards, not to mention China’s inclusion of nuclear
but the exclusion of gas.

For the Japan-led ATFSG, similar challenges abound in trying to marry various
national interests and characteristics. Still, there are areas where the region already
shows wide agreement. In the emerging ASEAN+Japan taxonomy, carbon-capture is
deemed a “green” investment. The reason is clear in light of the fact that a large fleet
of comparatively new coal-fired power plants generates almost half of the Asia-
Pacific’s electricity.

The regional average age of a coal plant in Asia is under 15 years, compared to the
30–40-year age of coal plant in the EU and U.S., according to the International Energy
Agency (IEA), which regards carbon capture as an essential technology for achieving
climate goals.

IEA’s research on Asian countries shows that the region is unlikely to retire those coal-
fired assets for at least a couple of decades. The capital costs are far from being
recovered and industry-heavy Asia needs ample 24/7 baseload power. Thus,
incentivizing carbon-capture to cope with coal is deemed a regional imperative.

Average Age of Coal Plant, by Region

















Source: IEA
The standard counter-argument to carbon capture is that it is unfeasible and that
Asian countries should simply deploy more wind, solar and other renewables. Yet that
assertion overlooks not only the hard fact of Asia’s very young coal plant but also the
most recent outlook for renewables. The May 2022 IEA Renewable Energy Market
Update forecasts that ASEAN installation of renewables will plunge from a peak of
about 14 GW in 2020 to below 7 GW in 2022 and 2023. The report also points to
elevated material costs and interest rates as potentially posing significant challenges
in the years ahead.

Like it or not, Asia clearly needs a broad portfolio of decarbonization technologies.

Declining Renewable Deployment in ASEAN


















Source: IEA
Is more diversity always better?
There is a downside to the proliferation of taxonomies. As decarbonization prices rise
due to commodity costs and interest rates, multiple taxonomies mean investors face
extra costs due to onerous reporting requirements. Yet the ATFSG’s ASEAN+Japan
initiative – together with other regional efforts – indicates that harmonization is being
built from the bottom-up, reflecting necessarily diverse routes to decarbonization.

The scope for overall harmonization of these regional initiatives exists in the
International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF), under whose auspices the China
and EU taxonomies are being harmonized. The IPSF was established in 2019 to
achieve this overall goal of coordination. At present, it includes Japan, the EU, China,
India, Indonesia, and other governments representing half the global population and
55% of both global GDP and global emissions.

Additional good news is that geopolitical inclusiveness and diversity are on the
ascendant in policymaking within the IPSF. In 2022, Japan, the EU, and Switzerland
began co-leading an IPSF working group on transition finance, with no announced
end-date. Its agenda includes drafting recommendations for the G20 Sustainable
Finance Working Group that meets in Jakarta next month under the Indonesian G20
presidency. In 2023, India will assume the G20 presidency. This “duplex of Asian G20
presidencies” is likely to drive Asian priorities into the work of harmonizing
taxonomies and defining sustainability.

This diversity of institutions and technologies, if managed well, could increase the
global buy-in for decarbonization through broader stakeholder consultation and R&D
investment. The patent risk of watering-down decarbonization goals seems at least
balanced by an expanding portfolio of financial tools and targets. Indeed, green
bonds are already complemented by sustainable bonds, transition bonds, and other
instruments to foster the multi-decadal, capital-intensive nature of decarbonization
processes.

In short, the old policymaking adage of “never let the perfect be the enemy of the
good” certainly applies to the work of making inclusive green taxonomies.


Conclusion
Defining green has gone from being dominated by Eurocentric ideals to a diverse
global debate, which the ATFSG epitomizes. Asian influence over ESG rules and
green taxonomies is likely to increase because of the region’s growing confidence and
economic weight whereas the EU is hobbled by internal disagreements. A more Asian
definition of green seems likely to increase support for multi-decadal energy
transitions. This offers the exciting prospect of truly radical decarbonization
innovations from the region.

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

California/ Offshore wind power
The California Energy Commission recommends building 3 GW of offshore wind by
2030, and more afterwards. By 2045, the state could produce up to 15 GW in offshore
wind, surpassing New York's target of 9 GW, the current largest long-term goal for
any American state.

Coal/ Energy transition
The switch from coal to renewable energy doesn't require natural gas as a “transition”
fuel; high prices for gas and the declining cost of renewables, such as wind and solar
power, make this possible, said a report by climate advocacy group TransitionZero.
Also, in an interview with the Financial Times, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry warned
not to return to coal after ending Russian energy supplies, saying the Ukraine war isn't
an excuse to renege on climate goals.

EU/ Energy transition
The EU will spend €195 billion to accelerate development of renewable power and
energy conservation in order to end Russian fossil fuels dependency by 2027. For
example, renewable energy projects will receive permits within a year, instead of the
current two years.

EU/ Gas prices
Gas prices surged when Russia said it’ll cut shipments to Europe through a major
pipeline. Gazprom said gas shipments are no longer possible through the Yamal
pipeline after the Kremlin imposed sanctions on European gas companies, some
former Gazprom units, as well as Europol Gaz, which owns the Polish part of the
Yamal pipeline.

Fossil fuels/ Investments
BlackRock will probably ignore shareholder resolutions on climate change because
short-term investment in fossil fuel production is needed to deal with the energy crisis.
Proposals to stop financing fossil fuel companies, as well as to decommission assets or
set targets compelling companies to reduce emissions in their supply chains, won’t be
welcome.

France/ Solar power
Solar developer Lightsource bp is starting operations in France, aiming to set up a 1
GW pipeline of large-scale PV projects by 2026. President Macron’s government is
committed to having at least 100 GW of solar by 2050.

Germany/ Wind power
Siemens Energy forecasts a €252 million net loss for Q2 due to problems at its wind
turbine subsidiary, Siemens Gamesa. Last year, in the same period, the company had
a €31 million profit. Siemens Energy said that 2022 financial results will be at the low
end because of Siemens Gamesa, which has been hit by supply chain disruptions.

Global markets/ Energy pricing
Following a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden to discuss global energy markets,
PM Mario Draghi proposed creating a cartel of oil consumers. Draghi and Biden are
unhappy with the structure of global energy markets and discussed ways of capping
oil and gas prices.

Hong Kong/Offshore wind power
HK Electric announced plans to build a 600-hectare wind farm off Lamma Island that
will consist of as many as 19 wind turbines. Annual electricity production is estimated
to reach 150 MW.

Portugal/ Solar power
An array of 12,000 solar panels was installed atop the Alqueva dam reservoir that
already has hydro-generating capacity of 256 MW. Built by the country's main utility,
EDP, when the solar facility is fully operational in July it’ll have a 5 MW capacity.

Russia/ Energy markets
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia has enough buyers outside of Western
countries for its energy resources. “Let the West pay more than it used to pay to the
Russian Federation, and let it explain to its population why they should become
poorer.”
