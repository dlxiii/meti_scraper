NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Japan’s next Basic Energy Plan likely to indicate strong electricity demand growth

(Japan NRG, Aug 23)
•  The next Basic Energy Plan might forecast the nation’s electricity demand to grow about 20% by
2040, driven by the buildout of energy-intensive industries like semiconductor manufacturing, as
well as data centers and other digital infrastructure, according to people familiar with govt
discussions.
•  The next Plan is likely to be published in early 2025, with February to April seen as the most likely
time.

•  CONTEXT: Japan’s current edition of the strategic document was published in 2021. The Plan
forecasted a 10% drop in electricity demand in Japan over the course of this decade. The Plan is
updated every three years or so.
• TAKEAWAY: Expectations for a decline in total electricity usage in the country were squashed in the last year
after the emergence of mass-market generative AI models. Large Japanese corporations like SoftBank have
vowed to build nationwide data center networks and pioneer home-grown genAI systems to support the
nation’s competitiveness in the digital age. The quick emergence of AI as the next demand driver has caught

the govt by surprise, but it’s now starting to provide its own outlook for the impact of this digital innovation. A
20% growth in 15 or so years is much lower than the numbers forecasted by experts, but it likely takes into
account efficiency gains and various constraints on digital asset growth.




Hydrogen subsidy program likely to accept applications in late Sept, say industry insiders

(Japan NRG, Aug 23)
•  The Contract for Difference (CfD) subsidy program for hydrogen projects will likely start to accept
applications from late September or October, according to industry stakeholders.
•  CONTEXT: Earlier this month, METI began public consultation on its proposal for the subsidies
program and for definitions of what can be described as “low-carbon hydrogen”. Feedback is
open until Sept 11.
•  The subsidies and standards follow the passing of the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act by the Diet

in June.
•  Once the consultation period ends, and METI has had time to respond to public comments,
pitches for financial support will be made by public-private groups interested in developing local
hydrogen supply chains for industry. This will include those seeking to build import terminals and
storage facilities.
• TAKEAWAY: There are about six such groups at the moment, but another two may emerge by the time the
tender closes, say industry stakeholders. METI may then take as much as six months to review applications and

select subsidy recipients.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Govt proposes to exempt hydrogen plants from earthquake safety regulation
(Government statement, Aug 21)
o  ANRE seeks public feedback on its plan to exempt state-approved low carbon hydrogen
and ammonia supply facilities from major earthquake safety requirements.

o  Feedback is accepted until Sept 19.
o  CONTEXT: Hydrogen and ammonia storage and production sites are high-pressure gas
facilities that would require internal earthquake safety rules reviewed by the local fire
department and other authorities.




MHI, Chevron to make green hydrogen in the U.S. starting 2025
(Nikkei, Aug 20)
•  Chevron and Mitsubishi Power Americas, a subsidiary of MHI, will begin to produce green
hydrogen in the state of Utah starting mid-2025.

•  Intermountain Power Agency (IPA) will source excess solar and wind power volumes from across
the U.S. and supply them to ACES Delta.
•  Chevron is the biggest shareholder in ACES; other investors include Singapore’s sovereign wealth
fund GIC, and a Canadian pension fund.
•  ACES expects to produce 100 tons of hydrogen per day using electrolyzers made by a Norwegian
firm in which MHI is an investor. The fuel will be stored in salt dome caverns, a type of

underground formation that is also used to store natural gas and oil.
•  The hydrogen will then be extracted as needed to be used as fuel alongside natural gas in IPA
power plants. IPA has plans to add a 840 MW gas-co-firing plant that’s expected to run on 30%
hydrogen.
•  CONTEXT: MHI claims this will be the world's first large-scale green hydrogen production, storage
and power generation project.
• TAKEAWAY: The production volumes are quite small compared to the sizes of planned blue hydrogen

projects. At such volumes, export of hydrogen makes little sense, while creating a local demand point for the
fuel helps to improve energy efficiency and lower costs. Japan’s domestic hydrogen production projects are
taking a similar approach. They will make up a smaller proportion of the Japanese hydrogen market but should
play an important role in future hydrogen industry development.




Toyota Tsusho, Pertamina to cooperate on biofuels and green hydrogen

(Nikkei Asia, Aug 21)
•  Toyota Tsusho and Indonesia's Pertamina will develop and supply biofuels and green hydrogen to
the Patimban Port and industrial park in West Java.
•  They plan to start demos in 2026 and commercialize the project by 2028.
•  This is one of about 70 agreements expected to be signed at the Asia Zero Emission Community
(AZEC) ministerial meetings in Indonesia.

METI, OCCTO file interim report on ‘simultaneous’ market framework plans
(Denki Shimbun, Aug 20)
•  METI and OCCTO issued an interim report on the ‘simultaneous’ market framework.
•  It outlined the results of technical studies into the start up of power generation facilities and output

allocation logic, as well as methods for determining market pricing.
•  CONTEXT: METI has been conducting a wholesale review of the current market structure for more
than a year and a half. It’s keen to introduce a so-called “three-part offer” system, which would
consider the three key factors that govern whether you can secure electricity in the market:
availability of capacity, availability of volume, and the cost and time involved in getting this
electricity to users.
•  The report showed results of a simulation that incorporated the one-hour-ahead market into the

simultaneous market, resulting in lower computational load and time.
•  Future expert discussions will focus on refining the system by addressing factors like renewable
energy forecasting errors and comparing the current auction system with the new proposed
framework.




JEPX begins tracking non-fossil fuel certificates
(Denki Shimbun, Aug 22)
•  On Aug 22, JEPX began to add tracking information to non-fossil fuel certificates, which will
contain key information such as power source type and production area.

certificates with a renewable energy designation derived from large hydropower and other sources
could only be tracked upon request.
•  CONTEXT: FIT non-fossil fuel energy certificates have been traded since around the start of the
decade. The first auction for non-FIT NFCs was in late 2020. Such certificates can also be sold
bilaterally.




Climate NGO intensifies criticism of JERA and ammonia co-firing

(Japan NRG, Aug 15)
•  The Kiko Network (KN), one of Japan’s leading climate action NGOs, intensified criticism of JERA
and its promotion of ammonia co-firing as a clean energy solution.
•  KN filed a complaint with the Japan Advertising Review Organization (JARO) against JERA
advertisements that position the co-firing of ammonia in coal-fired power plants as a “zero-
emission thermal power”.
•  KN and a lawyers’ group asked JARO to stop JERA and other power utilities from claiming co-

firing is a technology that doesn’t emit CO2, saying this is misleading.
•  KN claims that JARO in May declined to investigate the issue because it was beyond its scope of
judgment. As a result, the NGO has filed a complaint to the UN Secretary-General and asked for
international monitoring.

Chubu Electric: mistakes in renewables curtailment at dozens of power plants
(Company statement, Aug 21)
•  For FY2023, Chubu Electric Power Grid reported mistakes in renewables generation curtailment —
meant to prevent overloading or damaging the grid — at a total of 67 power plants.
•  It said the mistakes occurred due to omissions in updates or incorrect data input, and resulted in

insufficient reduction of power output at 67 power plants.
•  Chubu Electric will make adjustments to balance the output from FY2024 onwards.
•  CONTEXT: Curtailment occurs when renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, produce more
energy than the national grid can use. This happens when there's an oversupply of energy, or
when there are other constraints like congested transmission lines. Curtailments also mean lost
financial opportunities for renewables projects.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kyushu Electric took 350 MW of power amid equipment failure, tight reserve
(Company statement, Aug 21)
o  On Aug 21, Kyushu Electric Power Transmission and Distribution received up to 350 MW

LNG futures trading resumes on TOCOM after two-year hiatus

(Denki Shimbun, Aug 19)
•  On Aug 16, TOCOM trading in LNG futures took place for the first time in nearly two years, with 50
contracts executed due to a recently expanded "market maker system".
•  The trades involved November contracts, with 20 contracts (20 billion BTU, or 20,000 mmbtu)
executed in the morning and 30 contracts (20 billion BTU, or 30,000 mmbtu) in the afternoon. The
prices were ¥2,090 and ¥2,110, respectively.

Can Japan Transform CO2 Sea Transport From
Waste Management to Profit?

When the Japanese Advanced CCS Projects were first announced last year, only two
of the seven projects required overseas CO2 transportation. But recently, METI added
two more international projects, bringing the total to nine.

Now, of these nine, six will require marine transportation of CO2 — four to overseas
locations and two to domestic sites.

JOGMEC has stated that shipping CO2 from Japan to overseas storage sites will be
vital. Transportation of liquefied CO2 (LCO2) by ship is the obvious solution for the
CCS value chain, and this will require grappling with both engineering and cost issues.


Most storage sites are expected to be in Southeast Asia, as well as Australia, which
means long shipping routes that bring additional complications than if the CO2 was
stored at home. Clarifying on how most efficiently to transport CO2 will be imperative.

By 2030 most of the planned CCS projects are slated to start commercial operation,
yet much of the technology remains stuck in the R&D stage. Project developers are
worried about the overall cost assessment of the value chain, urging the industry to
move from its current engineering phase to more practical tests and applications.
Japan NRG explores some of the challenges that the nascent carbon industry is facing
in envisioning a CCS value chain to overseas storage sites.

New CCS advanced projects
The two newly added international projects are located in Malaysia, adding to the
other two overseas projects already included in the original list of seven – 1) the
Offshore Sarawak CCS involving JAPEX, K-Line, JGC Holdings, Petronas CCS
Ventures, etc, and which could store between 1.9 to 2.9 million tons of CO2 per year
from industries in Setouchi region (Okayama Pref) such as steel, power plants, and
chemical factories.

The second one is the Southern Malaysian Offshore Project that includes Mitsui & Co,
Chugoku Electric, Kansai Electric, and others. Plans call for storing around 5 million
tons of CO2 each year, targeting different industries such as power, cement,
chemicals, etc in Kinki, Chugoku and Kyushu. Both projects, according to METI, will
involve ships as well as pipelines for transportation.

Japanese Advanced CCS Projects





















Source: JOGMEC

The two principal methods for mass CO2 transportation are by pipeline and ship. The
first is most cost-effective when dealing with shorter distances, but as the distance
increases, ships become necessary. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) claims that the financial break-even point is 1,000 km, but in
Japan that figure can be lowered to 200-300 km, according to NYK and MHI.

Needless to say, this CO2 transportation method is not limited to the Japanese
Advanced CCS Projects alone. Recently, Chubu Electric and BP told Japan NRG about
plans for a major CCUS project at the Port of Nagoya and Indonesia's Tangguh gas
field. It seeks to annually capture 5 to 20 million tons of CO2 emissions that will be
transported on 20 liquefied CO2 ships to Tangguh. Operations are targeted to begin
by 2030, although the business model is still uncertain, and it will have to depend on
government subsidies. The two companies will now proceed with a more detailed
study before making a final investment decision.

Launching the CCS value chain
Marine transportation of CO2 is just one part of the overall CCS value chain. The first
step is, of course, to capture CO2 from an emitting source. After that, a complete
CCS value chain comprises the following phases:
•  Liquefaction
•  Temporary storage
•  Loading
•  Marine transportation
•  Heating

•  Boosting
•  Injection

In the final step, CO2 is injected directly into a offshore reservoir, or through a floating
barge, or in an offshore terminal (and then into a reservoir). As with any other value
chain, in order to be successful, minimizing the related costs is of crucial importance.

When it comes to the technical side of LCO2 ship transportation and its cost
assessment, an important point to consider is the pressure method, of which there are
three: Elevated Pressure (EP), Medium Pressure (MP), and Low Pressure (LP).

In March, NYK, in partnership with Chiyoda Corp and Knutsen Group, revealed the
results of their studies on the three methods. Temperature and pressure specifications
for the three look like this:


Mode  Temperature   Pressure

EP    from 0 to 10 C 34 to 45 bar
MP    from -30 to -25 C 15 to 18 bar

LP    from -50 to -45 C 6 to 10 bar


Considered were parameters such as operational risks, cost and energy consumption,
and the type of tanks for CO2. According to circumstances, one method may prove to
be better than another. In most situations, however, EP proved to be more cost
effective when considering capital expenditure and operating expense. The cost
stood between $52/ ton-CO2 (EP); and $59.9 (LP) for domestic transportation. In the
case of overseas (from Japan to Australia), it rose to $90.3 (EP); and $103.6 (LP).

One reason is that EP is less energy intensive. Unlike MP and LP, CO2 is kept at
ambient temperature in EP, not requiring refrigeration. Furthermore, EP allows for
CO2 of less purity and usage of Knutsen NYK Carbon Carriers’s Cargo Tank Cylinders
(CTC) tankers, two factors that make re-liquefaction unnecessary at the receiving
terminal. One future goal for KNCC is to lower the cost of CTC tankers, which can
handle 12 m3 of CO2 at a time.

CO2 density is actually a disadvantage for EP, since it's lower than for the other
methods. This means that larger tanks or more trips will be required in case of EP
deployment. While this issue can be mitigated, it is one example of the factors that
impede the possibility of establishing one method as superior to the others.
Proceeding on a case-by-case basis remains essential.

Building the LCO2 carriers
LCO2 transportation by ship is a new industry, and the only notable CCS project
involving shipping is Greensand in Denmark, which demonstrated crossborder CO2
storage, with CO2 captured in Antwerp transported by ship to Esbjerg, and then
stored in a depleted oil field in the North Sea.

In April, Dalian Shipyard launched the first two LCO2 carriers with a 7,500 m3 capacity
for the Northern Lights project in the North Sea, placing itself at the forefront of this
industry. Before that, the only notable LCO2 carriers were four small-sized (1,000-
2,000 m3) LCO2 carriers operated by Larvik Shipping built between 1999 and 2005.

As for Japan, in February METI unveiled the LCO2 transportation ship Excool built by
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. It has two tanks with a total capacity of 1,450 m3, and
starting October it will transport CO2 from KEPCO Maizuru Power Station in Kyoto
Prefecture to Tomakomai, Hokkaido.

With LCO2 carriers still few in number, one of the next challenges is to build an entire
fleet. From the time of contract signing, two to three years is needed to deliver a
finished vessel. Still, securing the required port facilities and CO2 tanks could be a
more daunting challenge.

JOGMEC’s view
Japan NRG reached out to JOGMEC regarding its expectations for CO2
transportation by ship, and the answer was that it will be a key method for enhancing
the feasibility of CCS projects. JOGMEC recognizes the challenges that need to be
overcome in order to launch the industry in a cost-efficient and sustainable manner.


First, current domestic construction capacity for storage tanks and ships is not
sufficient. These challenges were made clear last year in a feasibility study, which
pointed out the necessity for increased capacity. JOGMEC intends to further explore
the matter with the newly announced projects.

One of the key issues to address is the standardization of liquefied CO2 ship
transportation in CCS projects. As this new industry emerges, common rules,
guidelines and technical standards are lacking, and they need to be established
together with the necessary infrastructure (such as facilities at ports). Furthermore,
JOGMEC is considering collaborating with the government to develop support
measures to resolve these issues.

Conclusion
Ironically, the greatest challenge faced by CO2 transportation is CO2 itself. As a
product without inherent value, handling it is basically waste management. Therefore,
finding the most cost efficient way to dispose of it will be a top priority. Technical
details such as choosing the best transportation method, or enabling the production
of sufficient tanks and ships, are all part of the solution to the big question – “How can
we make this tech work?”

The next question could be: Is CCS worth the effort and resources? A CCS chain could
turn out to be far more costly than emitters and receivers would like to hear. The best
solution would be to turn waste into a valuable product (i.e., CO2 utilization), but this
alone won’t impact the amount of CO2 that abatement projects aim to capture.
Therefore, efficient storage remains essential.

CO2 will have to prove itself as a convenient product in sectors where it’s considered
to be a candidate for utilization. The CCS business model currently has little benefit
from a carbon credits market that is voluntary, as is the case in Japan. Those
businesses and investors that are voluntarily interested in ‘going green’ tend to prefer
to put money into options further removed from oil and gas.

The most powerful catalyst for a CCS value chain will likely be found in carbon
crediting under a compulsory market and with a carbon tax framework. This will
require careful governmental intervention, both in terms of funding and regulation.

METI’s 2030 deadline for commercializing the CCS projects is approaching, and it’s
time for the businesses involved to decide what to do before the day of reckoning
arrives. Positioning CCS as an effective industry that fosters decarbonization goals will
require settling technical matters and, perhaps most importantly, guaranteeing profits
for those involved. Few will pay for CCS on a voluntary basis.

Japanese Municipalities Aim for Increased

Use of Clean Energy in Emergencies
A series of natural disasters this summer, from an earthquake in south Japan to
Typhoon Ampil along the coast of greater Tokyo, served as a reminder of the need to
make energy systems resilient even in times of extreme crises.

Efforts to mitigate ensuing risks now extend to energy generation with a growing
number of municipalities across the country seeking to switch from fossil fuels to
renewable energy in order to secure power supply during emergencies.

The issue of securing backup sources is becoming more important as the mainstay of
Japan’s energy system are aging thermal plants. This is a factor that even METI
minister Saito recently underscored, noting that periods of extreme weather, such as
this summer’s heat, are putting undue strain on domestic energy systems.


Given the difficulty in accurately predicting extreme weather impact, never mind the
occurrence of a natural disaster, local and national authorities are also looking for
emergency backup energy sources that could be utilized quickly and flexibly.
Restarting a mothballed coal or oil-fired power plant would take days, even if it had
received regular maintenance. That’s another reason why municipalities are turning to
batteries, EVs, and other clean energy sources, seeking both lower emissions and a
more nimble approach.

Japan NRG takes a look at some energy emergency response measures implemented
in the wake of major disasters, as well as recent trends showing increased reliance on
renewables in times of emergency.

Push for use of renewables-derived power in emergencies
The national government is urging municipalities to take the lead in introducing
renewable energy to public facilities as part of measures for evacuation centers that
are designated for use in disasters.

The goal to transition from thermal power to renewables-produced electricity during
times of crises was included in the MoE’s disaster plan in 2020. The MoE allocated ¥2
billion in FY2024 on top of the ¥2 billion in the FY2023 supplementary budget for
related initiatives. The amount covers subsidies for a portion of the cost of the
installation of renewable energy generation facilities, cogeneration systems (CGS),
and their ancillary facilities such as storage batteries, charging and discharging
facilities, and CO2 reduction assets.

Perhaps the first example of when a local government in Japan reached for clean
energy following a major disaster came in September 2018 when Hokkaido Prefecture
procured power for some areas in the wake of an earthquake. Damage had led to a
halt at Units 1, 2 and 4 at Hokkaido Electric’s coal-fired 1.65 GW Tomato-Atsuma
Power Plant.


23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Early on Sept 8, the prefecture began to procure backup power using a redox flow
grid-scale battery system at Hokkaido Electric’s Minami-Hayakita substation. That site
paired solar power with batteries.

The Minami-Hayakita BESS, with a capacity of 51 MWh, and able to provide 17 MW
for three hours, had been developed by Sumitomo Electric for Hokkaido Electric. The
system, which is now in operation, was only launched at its current commercial scale in
April 2022. However, it had already been installed in demo mode in 2015. At the time
of the disaster, it was able to deliver power for four hours, at a rate of 15 MW.

Nissan lends a charge in emergencies
EVs are another solution to secure backup power during outages. In recent years, with
a spate of natural disasters such as typhoons, torrential rains, and earthquakes, EV
manufacturers have faced many requests to assist with their vehicles, including from
municipal local governments.

Towards that goal, in 2020, Nissan unveiled a 100% electric emergency response car
concept, designed to provide a mobile power supply following natural disasters or
extreme weather conditions.

The RE-LEAF prototype is based on the Nissan LEAF passenger car. Alongside
modifications to navigate roads covered in debris, the car features weatherproof plug
sockets mounted directly to the exterior of the vehicle, which enable 110- to 230-volt
devices to be powered from the car's high-capacity lithium-ion battery.


In 2019, Sapporo agreed with Nissan Motor to supply electricity from EVs at
evacuation centers and other
facilities in case of a disaster.
Nissan LEAF – the world's first
mass-produced EV – can be
lent to evacuation centers for
use as emergency power in
the event of a major outage.

Sapporo also agreed with
other car manufacturers to
enable households using
vehicle-to-home technology
to use power from EVs even
during blackouts.

During a power outage, the car can power:
• Electric jackhammer – 24 hours – 36 kWh
• Pressure ventilation fan – 24 hours – 21.6 kWh
• 10-liter soup kettle – 24 hours – 9.6 kWh
• Intensive care medical ventilator – 24 hours – 3 kWh
• 100-watt LED floodlight – 24 hours – 2.4 kWh

Cogeneration among the options
In Tokyo, the metropolitan government has decided to diversify power supplies
through a wider outreach to include independent and decentralized energy sources,
such as high-efficiency cogeneration systems.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) is also installing solar power systems for
medical institutions and emergency evacuations facilities in Tokyo. This effort was
included in the revised 2023 plan for disaster response in Tokyo in 2023.

Tokyo’s efforts to expand renewable energy usage is influencing its wider activities.
For example, the TMG is providing a range of subsidies for welfare organizations to
build or refurbish their facilities and equipment to accommodate renewable energy
sources for help in times of disasters. The authorities are offering up to ¥4 million for
introducing portable storage batteries and up to ¥13 million for vehicle-to-home
appliances that are used in connection with EVs.

Despite efforts to expand the use of renewables, the amount of electricity generated
from green sources in Tokyo in FY2022 was estimated at about 166 TWh, while the
amount consumed was estimated at 758 TWh; meaning that renewables provided
roughly 22% of the capital’s power.

To expand this further, municipalities will need to be more creative not only in
supplying the funds but also in infrastructure planning. Backup fossil fuel generation
systems have been in place for decades and have evolved to have clear standards,
processes, storage and transport infrastructure for moving fuel. Now the same will
need to be put into place to accommodate EVs, grid batteries, and other clean
energy sources.


For the moment, too much of the momentum for shifting emergency power sources
from oil-based diesel generators is in the hands of the national and prefectural
governments. Both set policy and distribute budgets but they’re usually not in charge
of installing energy facilities.

And yet, giving more emphasis to the decarbonization of emergency power sources in
the next iteration of the Basic Energy Plan should be able to motivate more
municipalities to be active in this space.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Solar power
Environmental approval was granted for a $19 billion solar power project to export
electricity to Singapore. The Australia-Asia Power Link is planned to generate 6 GW of
renewable energy, one-third of which would be sent to Singapore via an undersea
cable.

Australia / Wind power
Collgar Renewables, which operates the largest wind farm in Western Australia, said it
plans to boost its portfolio by building five new wind projects across the state, with a
total capacity of 1.7 GW.

China / Coal power
China, the world's largest builder of coal-fired power stations, cut the number of
permits for new plants by nearly 80% in the first half of 2024, said Greenpeace East
Asia.

China / Nuclear power
Nuclear power accounts for under 2% of China’s total installed energy capacity but
has increased at 5% per year since 2018 compared with a total national capacity
growth of 9% per year. China plans a major nuclear reactor expansion that should
boost capacity and generation significantly in the next decade.

India / Natural gas
India is unlikely to meet its goal of increasing the share of natural gas in the national
energy mix to 15% by 2030, said Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, adding that the
country will reach only about 8%.

India / Nuclear power
Nuclear Power Corp of India said that Unit 4 of the Kakrapar NPP achieved full
operation at 700 MW, becoming the country’s second domestically built nuclear
reactor to reach full capacity.

Indonesia / Energy minister
Outgoing president Joko Widodo reshuffled the cabinet and replaced the country's
energy minister, just weeks before leaving office. Bahlil Lahadalia will replace Arifin
Tasrif as the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.

Marine bunkering
Global maritime trade is set to grow 40% by mid-century, while total global marine
fuel sales are expected to grow 2% between now and 2030. Marine bunkering in Asia
Pacific is set to grow 3 percentage points between now and 2030, increasing its
global market share to 51%. However, that market’s volume might begin shrinking in
the early 2030s due to increased fuel efficiency.

Offshore wind power
Global offshore wind installations grew 7% in 2023 and is expected to expand,
surpassing 520 GW by 2040, (excluding China), according to Rystad Energy. Europe
will drive most growth since it will heavily depend on floating wind to meet national
targets. The continent is expected to account for more than 70% of global floating
wind installations by 2040.

Southeast Asia / solar power
Southeast Asia’s solar industry boom could be threatened by looming U.S. tariff hikes
of up to 50% as the U.S. and EU attempt to check China. Four countries are targeted:
Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. They account for over 40% of solar
module production outside China, though many Chinese firms are setting up shop in
the region.

| of up to 50% as the U.S. and EU attempt to check China. Four countries are targeted: |

| module production outside China, though many Chinese firms are setting up shop in |
| the region. |
