Japan to expand fuel stockpile guidelines to oil and coal
(Japan NRG, Oct. 26)
•  On Oct. 25, fuel guidelines took effect that require power utilities to keep sufficient LNG in reserve
and to share data on this.

•  METI now plans to expand the guidelines to oil and coal.
•  METI fears a potential power crunch could hit Japan this winter. The power reserve rate in Tokyo is
marginally above the 3% threshold level in the first quarter of 2022, METI warned.
•  As one of the countermeasures, the ministry has commissioned the Electricity and Gas Market
Surveillance Commission (EGC) to write new rules that will ensure non-discriminatory terms for
independent players to acquire power supply from regional power grid.
•  Other measures include strengthening the accuracy of forecasts around excess capacity and power

generation, and closely monitoring the spot electricity market as well as the actions of regional grid
operators.



METI minister asks UAE energy minister to raise oil output

(Japan NRG, Oct. 26)
•  METI Minister Hagiuda asked United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei
to raise crude oil output to help stabilize rising prices.
•  The ministers also discussed expanding cooperation in hydrogen.
•  CONTEXT: The UAE is Japan’s largest crude oil supplier, accounting for 40% of its imports. Saudi
Arabia is the second largest supplier, followed by Kuwait, Qatar and Russia.
•  CONTEXT: In April, Japan and UAE signed a Memorandum of Cooperation on hydrogen. Toyota
Motor is also taking part in hydrogen project studies in the UAE.




Opposition parties skip voicing anti-nuclear views ahead of general election
(Mainichi Shimbun, Oct. 25)
•  Of the ten Japanese nuclear reactors restarted since the Fukushima disaster, four are on the island
of Kyushu. Possibly because of the high concentration of nuclear facilities, Kyushu has seen little

debate on nuclear policy in the lead up to the Oct. 31 lower house election.
•  A local coalition of opposition parties established at the end of 2020 and comprised of the
Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the Japanese Communist Party and the Social
Democratic Party, initially opposed operating nuclear reactors after the end of their 40-year design
lives.
•  However, references to opposition to nuclear restarts were deleted in the most recent version of
the coalition’s joint manifesto, which had a watered-down promise to consider the effects on jobs

and the local economy while reducing reliance on nuclear energy.
•  A local city councilor who supports the CDP says almost everyone is related to someone working in
the nuclear energy and there’s little support for policies to divest from nuclear energy.

batteries, and consumer-facing initiatives such as a points-based scheme to encourage people to
insulate their homes.




Japan elaborates support programs to ASEAN ahead of COP26
(Japan NRG, Oct. 27)
•  Japan’s support programs to ASEAN for combating climate change were elaborated on during the
Oct. 27 Japan-ASEAN leaders meeting.
•  According to the disclosure, there is a need for more transparency and clarity in data, which means

better emission measurement and reporting, the building of inventories, the use of satellite data,
disclosure by financial institutions and wider use of life cycle assessments.
•  Mitigation includes setting long term strategies and policies, identifying decarbonization roadmaps
for each sector, spreading decarbonization technologies through the Joint Credit Mechanism
(JCM) system, and building zero-carbon smart cities.
•  Adaptation is about building platforms, disaster prevention programs, and utilizing satellite

meteorological data.



Government investing in science to suppress cattle burps
(Jiji, Oct. 24)
•  Japan became one of over 30 countries to join The Global Methane Pledge, due to be officially
launched at the COP26 summit, is an initiative to reduce global methane emissions 30% by 2030.
•  As part of efforts to reduce its methane emissions, Japan will ramp up research into new types of

cattle feed that suppress belching, which is a major cause of methane emissions.
•  Local farmers are well versed in methane-reducing techniques such as the periodic draining of
paddy fields to suppress levels of anaerobic bacteria in the soil. The government will share this
expertise with other nations.
•  CONTEXT: Methane accounts for 17% of total global GHG emissions. Japan has already made
some progress in methane reduction, with its methane emission levels 23 times lower than the U.S.




Green Innovation Fund WG releases concept of green connected cars
(Japan NRG, Oct. 26)
•  The Green Innovation Fund working group released an overview of how connected cars help to cut
emissions and the technology needed to realize such smart vehicles, according to a METI report.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Automated driving could improve traffic congestion and reduce car accidents, and cut carbon
emissions potentially by 1.69 million tons by 2030 and 1.32 million tons by 2050, METI said.
•  If data is processed at cloud data centers, however, the data centers may not be able to
accommodate the expected surge in data volumes of around 30% per year. This may cause power
issues in the cloud network.

•  The Green Innovation Fund said it aims for storage batteries with energy intensity of 135 kWh,
efficient power trains and systems capable of sustaining continuous battery hours of 13.5 hours.
This will require a 70% energy saving of automated driving system devices. A pilot run of green-
connected cars should take place before 2030.
•  The Green Innovation working group proposes spending ¥151 billion to develop storage batteries
and engines. The budget to develop connectivity technology was provided separately under the

MaaS (Mobility as a Service) project run with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism.
•  CONTEXT: In addition to increasing battery capacity, temperature control of batteries mounted on
vehicles requires a major technological breakthrough as overheated devices cause safety issues.



Solar group gives qualified praise for Basic Energy Plan

(New Energy Business News, Oct. 29)
•  ASPEn, an association of small and medium-sized solar generators, released an official opinion on
the government’s sixth basic energy plan.
•  While praising the government’s target to install 120 GW of generation capacity by 2030, the
group called for more detailed statistics on progress against this target, investment in transmission
infrastructure, and tougher measures against those building solar farms on inappropriate sites.
•  ASPEn says that in many parts of Japan there are no signs the chronic shortage of transmission

capacity will improve in the near future. Even in greater Tokyo, some operators of large farms are
told they’ll to wait until 2030 at the earliest for suitable grid connections.



NEDO invests ¥32 billion into hydrogen/ammonia powered ships

(New Energy Business News, Oct. 27)
•  The state-backed research hub NEDO has decided to fund four projects to research alternative
shipping fuels. NEDO’s Green Innovation fund will invest ¥32 billion in the projects.
•  Selected for funding are: a project to develop a hydrogen powered marine engine and fuel
system, a project to develop an ammonia fueled marine engine, a project to develop a
commercially viable ammonia powered ships, and a project to use catalysts and engine
improvements to reduce ‘methane slip’ from LNG-powered marine engines.

Aircon major Daikin bets on next-generation cooling tech to improve EVs
(Asia Nikkei, Oct. 27)
•  A remark by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that he’d love to get into home heating, ventilation and air

conditioning (HVAC) systems has inspired Japan’s Daikin Industries to start working on next-
generation cooling technologies.
•  Daikin is working on magnetic cooling technology that won’t need to use refrigerants or a
compression, which account for the majority of the GHG emissions and power consumption.
•  Daikin sees commercialization around 2025.
•  The Japanese manufacturer also seeks to commercialize by fiscal 2025 a power-saving refrigerant
for automotive air conditioners that extends the range of EVs by up to 50%.



Oji Paper sets sights on carbon neutrality

(Nikkei, Oct. 28)
•  Oji Holdings pledged to reduce GHG gas emissions to zero by 2050.
•  To this end, the company will reduce emissions by over 70% by 2030.
•  Oji is aggressively expanding forestry holdings in Brazil and New Zealand, and plans to add 1.5
million hectares by 2030.
•  By selecting fast-growing tree varieties better able to efficiently store carbon dioxide, Oji says it
can further reduce its carbon footprint.
•  However, a bidding war for New Zealand farm land suitable for forestry conversion means that Oji

may have to spend far more on land acquisition than the ¥100 billion it has allocated.

Seven of 10 major power utilities cut profit forecasts; TEPCO sees first loss in nine years
(Nikkei, Oct. 29)
•  Seven of Japan’s top 10 power utilities have revised their full-year financial forecasts downward,
citing rising fuel costs and greater competition in electricity retail.
•  TEPCO, Japan’s biggest power company, forecasts a ¥16 billion ($140 million) loss in fiscal year
ending March 2022, its first in nine years. The previous forecast was a ¥67 billion profit.
•  TEPCO says business will suffer if commodity prices continue rising.

•  CONTEXT: Power firms can raise electricity prices to account for higher cost of procuring fossil
fuels as part of a so-called fuel adjustment system. However, the time lag between increased fuel
costs and rising consumer tariff rates means companies must manage the interim based on the
strength of their own finances.
•  Chugoku Electric is another utility that expects to be deeply in the red this fiscal year, with a
projected loss of ¥14 billion.

•  Other utilities to lower profit forecasts are:
•  Chubu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, Hokuriku, and Okinawa Electric. The first three have a high ratio of
thermal power generation and cut their forecasts significantly.
•  There’s strong competition from new power companies that entered the market after the full
deregulation of electricity retailing in 2016. The more than 700 electricity retailers have gained just
over 20% of the market by undercutting the price plans of the big players.




Market share of new power retailers breaks 20% level for first time
(Japan NRG, Oct. 28)
•  The market share of “new power companies”, most of which joined the electricity retail market
since 2016, has broken through the 20% level for the first time. See chart below published by the
Basic Gas Policy sub-committee.

•  New entrant in the power market held a 21.3% market share of the total market at the end of June
this year, while the share for low-voltage power (i.e., mostly households) was up to 22.8%.
•  CONTEXT: The rest of the market is mostly in the hands of the 10 legacy power utilities, the
EPCOs, such as TEPCO and Kansai Electric.
•  “New power companies” accounted for 19.1% of Japanese electricity sales in September 2020,
while their share of the low-voltage market was 21.1% (up from zero as of April 2016).
•  New market challengers have made the most gains in the Tokyo region (30.1%), followed by

Hokkaido (24.3%) and Kansai (23.6%). Okinawa had the least penetration (10%) from new players.

Renewable operators ask govt. to keep tariffs fixed for several more years
(Japan NRG, Oct. 29)
•  The Power Tariff Committee held a hearing on renewable pricing and regulatory issues. Japan
Photovoltaic Energy Association said solar capacity growth is likely to slow in the coming years as
there are fewer plans for large installations to supply businesses and new home constructions are

decreasing.
•  The shift to Feed-in-Premium from Feed-in-Tariff systems is also slow as only a few operators have
actual plans in place to make the shift due to a lack of visibility on how the new scheme will affect
their earnings.
•  The association asked for pricing to stay fixed at the current level until fiscal 2025 to motivate an
expansion in solar power capacity.




METI says cold snap will mean tight electricity supply
(Asahi Shimbun, Oct. 27)
•  METI says winter demand for electricity in many regions will exceed 96% of capacity, making this

•  While the Ministry says it currently has no plans to demand consumers to reduce electricity use, it
will encourage residential and commercial users to make reductions if this is possible without
making sacrifices.
•  According to METI projections, a one in ten years cold snap in February would cause demand in
areas served by TEPCO to reach 97% of capacity.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

•  The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2020 says that cost input reductions in
the past decade mean the cost of solar-generated electricity in most countries is now lower than
that from newly-built coal or gas-fired power stations.
•  The IEA predicts that by 2035 the cost of energy from renewable sources, even when combined
with storage batteries, will be lower than that from fully depreciated coal or gas power stations.

•  When we interpret expert predictions in light of recent trends in solar panel efficiency, we see that
by 2050 the cost of electricity from solar farms will be less than ¥2 yen/ kWh, and maybe closer to
¥1yen/ kWh.


Osaka Gas and Sky Solar Japan to collaborate on solar
(PR Times, Oct. 27)
•  Osaka Gas signed a memorandum of understanding with Sky Solar Japan on the development and
joint ownership of solar farms. The goal is to install tens of megawatts of additional generation
capacity every year for the next few years.

•  Osaka Gas’ decision to work with Sky Solar reflects the increasing scarcity of large sites suitable for
solar farms.
•  The Daigas Group pledged to install 5 GW of renewable capacity internationally by 2030,
including that sourced from partners.

Number of firms using “carbon neutral” gas in Japan jumps to 78
(Gas Energy News, Oct. 25)
•  The number of city gas companies in Japan that have introduced “carbon neutral” LNG or gas has
increased rapidly since the summer and now counts at least 31.
•  In an effort to decarbonize, manufacturers and others are actively switching to “carbon neutral”

gas supplies for use in factories and other facilities. The number of clients buying “carbon neutral”
volumes from just the three major gas suppliers now counts 78. Inquiries from new firms are also
coming in.
•  The credits used to offset the gas emissions come from different sources. Tokai Gas, for example,
is using the domestic J-Credits system.
•  The biggest supplier of “carbon neutral” gas in Japan is Tokyo Gas, procuring about 205,000 tons

so far for 43 domestic buyers. Osaka Gas has procured one LNG carrier’s worth (about 70,000 tons)
of “carbon neutral” LNG for 19 clients. Toho Gas has produced two cargos (about 132,000 tons) to
supply 16 clients.
•  End users include manufacturers like Aichi Steel.

Japan imports first “carbon neutral” LNG cargo from Russia

(Denki Shimbun, Oct. 26)
o  Sakhalin Energy, which operates Sakhalin-2 off the coast of Sakhalin, Russia, supplied
Toho Gas with the project's first “carbon-neutral” LNG. This is the first time that a
“carbon-neutral” LNG cargo was delivered from a Russian producer to an Asia-Pacific
buyer.
o  The cargo was delivered on Oct. 13 at the Chita terminal. The carbon credits to offset
GHG emissions were procured from Gazprom Marketing & Trading, the parent group of

Sakhalin Energy.
o  Sakhalin Energy is studying how to ensure a continuous supply of carbon-neutral LNG.
o  CONTEXT: Sakhalin Energy ships just over half of its LNG to Japan.

Japan’s trading houses swap coal for gas, target CCUS
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Oct. 27)
•  Japan’s trading houses are withdrawing from coal and thermal power assets, while aggressively
investing in natural gas, which is expected to be in high demand, especially in electric power and

steel industries.
•  The firms are also rushing to promote carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) during
production and "carbon-neutral” LNG.
•  Mitsubishi Corporation has stressed it will contribute to the stable supply of LNG. Mitsui & Co.
sees LNG as a "transitional fuel" with the future more likely to feature renewable energy, hydrogen
and ammonia.
•  In the Tangguh LNG Project in Indonesia, which is being developed and operated by Mitsubishi,

Mitsui, Sumitomo Corporation, Sojitz Corporation, and others, there are plans to introduce CCUS,
which will capture 25 million tons of CO2 emitted during the production of natural gas and re-
inject and store it in the gas fields under development, thereby reducing CO2 emissions and
increasing natural gas production.




INPEX joins Idemitsu in Norway oil project as Osaka Gas exits
(Company statements, various, Oct. 28)

a joint venture between Osaka Gas and Sumitomo Corporation, to acquire 50.5 percent (50.5%) of
shares in Idemitsu Snorre Oil Development Co., which is developing oil deposits in Norway.
•  INPEX will buy one percent of the 50.5% of shares held by Idemitsu and all the shares held by OSR

(49.5%), to acquire a total of 50.5 percent in the project. The deal will be closed at the start of next
year.
•  CONTEXT: INPEX and Idemitsu have worked together on offshore gas fields in Vietnam and a
geothermal power business in Japan.
•  Idemitsu Snorre Oil Development owns 11 oil and natural gas assets in production and/or under
development, including the Norwegian state-controlled Equinor-led Snorre Project, as well as

interests in multiple discovered but undeveloped oil and gas fields and exploration licenses.
•  That flagship Snorre Project is expected to draw 35% of its entire power from the Hywind Tampen
floating wind farm currently under construction.
•  With this sale, Osaka Gas will withdraw from the oil exploration and production business, which it
entered in 2005, in order to focus on gas and renewables.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE


Japan at COP26:
Adapting to Great Expectations

The Japanese delegation at this week!s UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in
Scotland will have three main focuses: Coal; How to value and trade carbon; and,
Rules for measuring emissions.

Some members of the delegation expect the climate talks to be tense and stretch
beyond COP26!s Nov. 12 closing date. Nevertheless, they feel there’s broad
consensus among the close to 200 participating countries on certain topics, especially
the need to kickstart an international market mechanism for carbon credits.

In recent years an international climate event would have filled Japanese negotiators
with dread. The country was routinely slammed for supporting coal-fired generation,
with one environmental NGO twice crowning Japan with its satirical "Fossil of the
Day” award. Previous Environment Minister Koizumi even claimed such criticism was a
catalyst for the country!s net-zero emissions pledge.

A year on from Japan!s commitment, however, and attitudes towards coal power
plants are shifting. The G7 recently narrowed its criticism of coal to "unabated”
thermal stations, while touting the potential of carbon capture and co-firing systems.
There!s also a growing interest globally in some form of carbon credits both to offset
the CO2 that cannot be avoided and to encourage efforts that does avoid it.

For Japan, the position change on coal and greater global interest in international
mechanism for carbon credit offer hope of solutions that can act in concert with a turn
to renewable energy. While Japan has committed to doubling the ratio of renewables
in its power mix by 2030, that move alone wouldn!t curb emissions by the amount
specified in its NDC pledge.

Equally important for Japan will be to direct the global conversation during COP26
towards how to measure CO2 and other greenhouse gases at the local, corporate and
national level. At stake is Japan!s ability to carry out decarbonization not only at home
but also to lead the effort across Asia.


Changing attitudes to coal
International criticism of Japan’s coal use finally pushed METI to announce in July
2020 that it would look to scrap all "inefficient” coal-fired power plants by 2030. At
the time, local media reported that as many as 114 out of 140 coal power units in the
country would be scrapped.

After a year of debates around what constitutes "inefficient,” Japan finds itself in a
somewhat more amenable policy environment. The 2018 Paris Rulebook was
somewhat ambiguous on coal but in May the G7 Environment and Climate Ministers
Meeting clarified the extent of the push against coal. The G7 communiqué noted that
aid will be stopped only for new coal plants that are "unabated” (i.e., there is no effort

made to curb their emissions), while leaving the possibility of building new plants that
have carbon capture systems and allow for co-firing of coal and either biomass,
hydrogen or ammonia.

This idea that only unabated coal-fired plants should be eliminated is backed by the
International Energy Agency (IEA).

Of course, criticism of Japan!s coal policy has not stopped completely. Only this
month, Gonzalo Munoz, the UN High-Level Climate Champion, spoke at the Japan
Climate Initiative Online Conference to call for an entire phase-out of coal-fired
generation by 2030. On a practical level, however, it’s known that both Japanese
industry and the government don’t see this as feasible and they’ll never agree to it at
COP26.

In fact, Japan!s negotiators feel the country can stand taller at this week!s event in
Glasgow. The country has "caught up” with the global environmental agenda over the
last year, said Tamura Kentaro, director of the Institute for Global Environmental
Strategies (IGES). Japan’s broader COP26 negotiation team includes staff from IGES.

Out of the 197 jurisdictions attending COP26, only 59 have declared carbon neutrality
by 2050-2060 as a goal. Japan is among them, but even more significant, the country
is one of eight jurisdictions to have written the goal into law, and is one of only a
dozen or so to have increased the size of its emissions reduction program as per the
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).

Japan!s Oct. 22 NDC filing said that in FY2030 emissions will drop by 46% (and maybe
as much as 50%) from FY2013 levels. The previous NDC from 2016 aimed for a 26%
reduction.

How to cut CO2?
Given that Japan still expects to rely on coal for 19% of its power at the end of the
decade, down from twice that currently, critics have questioned how emissions would
drop by so much.

IGES explains that this is possible if Japan’s industries change their mindset from only
thinking about energy efficiency to including the ideas around energy transition.

According to IGES, Japan needs to double the speed of its energy transition by
replacing fossil fuel energy with renewables at a pace of 2% per year. So far, it has
only been 1.2%/ year at most. IGES calculations for meeting the 46% emissions
reduction factor in economic growth of 1.3%/ year and energy efficiency
improvements of 1.5%/ year. As far as renewables-for-fossil fuels replacement, Japan
should be able to slash 3.5% of its emissions on an annual basis, according to IGES.

The transition will come in stages and is unlikely to be linear, but it should unfold as
follows:

•  New coal plant construction plans are scrapped in Japan and overseas
•  Co-firing and CCUS technologies are introduced
•  Renewable energy sources become stronger
•  Coal producers are helped to retire their capacity

The gradual approach is also gaining support across many countries as concerns
about energy shortages and over-reliance on other fuels such as natural gas grow on
the back of recent price spikes in energy commodities around the world.

Article 6 of the Paris Rulebook
Japan has always favored a market-driven approach to climate change, claiming that
regulatory pressures will discourage innovation. As a host of the Kyoto Protocol that
founded the CDM scheme, it engaged with developing countries for emission-
reduction projects, generating offset credits that Japan could claim against its own
CO2 total.

Since 2013, Japan has carried out 203 projects in 17 countries, earning offset credits
for 2.2 million tons of carbon.

By 2030, Japan needs to cut approximately 452 million tons of carbon from its total.
Of that, 352 million tons will be from the energy transition and better energy
efficiency, while another 100 million tons will come through offsets, according to
Japan!s NDC document.

The successful launch of an international credit trading mechanism is essential for
Japan to achieve its NDC goals, according to IGES.

International consensus, however, is still lacking on how to manage the proceeds from
credit trades; on the accounting rules needed to avoid double-counting; and around
credits earned from the Clean Development Mechanism programs.

Climate speaks for itself
Japan may be feeling less of a target at COP26 than it has in the past, but pressure
will not stop with the summit. December 2022 is the deadline for the first progress
report on the updated NDCs. In 2023, Japan will also host the G7 summit, with
climate issues high on the agenda.

Behind the scenes, METI and state-backed JOGMEC are soliciting utilities, energy
companies and trading houses to honor the IEA roadmap, to shift to LNG-powered
stations instead of coal, and to deploy either co-firing or CCUS technologies at
"unabated” coal power plants.

Once the amended Japanese climate law takes effect in April 2022, the Environment
Ministry will start requesting municipalities to create "renewable energy promotion
zones”, as well as zones that cannot host any power stations, to make sure the
decarbonization agenda takes root at local level.

In a way, such regulatory strong-arming of industry and municipalities is a change of
approach for Japan, which had mostly relied on market mechanisms and voluntary
contributions to tackle climate change.

One reason for the tactical change could be the warning signs from the climate itself.
Japan!s air temperature has risen 1.2 degrees Celsius in the last 100 years, more than
the global average increase of 0.8 degrees, according to the Japan Meteorological
Research Institute. Sea temperatures are up 1.16 degrees locally compared with a
global 0.5-degree bump.

As a result, Japanese sea levels are up 10 centimeters in the last century and hot and
cold extreme swings in temperature are on the rise. Meteorologists point to stronger
winds and heavier precipitations, and as a result more frequent natural disasters that
have destroyed infrastructure, including solar farms and other renewable facilities.

Higher sea temperatures are also changing Japan!s fishing catch and, in turn, the local
food chain. Rather than COP26, the climate itself will ultimately determine if Japan!s
actions are sufficiently sustainable.

METI’s Ambitious Outlook for Power Generation in Japan:

How Will it Impact the Global LNG Market?
By approving the sixth iteration of the Basic Energy Plan on Oct. 22, Japan has
cemented its medium to long-term policy shift away from coal and gas in power
generation in favor of renewables. That strategy will likely cause a major impact not
only on Japan’s purchases but also on the global LNG industry as a significant part of
global LNG supply may need to look for a new home.

The new Plan charts a trajectory for LNG’s share of the power mix to fall from 37% in
2019 to 20% in 2030. Based on 2019 import numbers and government data, that
would free up a volume that’s equivalent to 6.6% of global imports, or close to India’s
total imports in that year.

If Japanese power and city gas consumption remains around the 2019 level, then the
country’s LNG imports would drop to around 50 million tons in 2030, just under 10%
of the forecasted global demand. The ratio was at 22% in 2019.

So far, Japanese officials in charge of oil and gas say that rather than curtailing
purchases on the global market, the nation’s companies will buy more cargoes come
the end of the decade. Such confidence suggests Japan sees LNG playing a major
role in Southeast Asia’s energy developments over the course of the decade. Perhaps
it also shows a belief that natural gas will remain relevant well into the future.

Background

The 6th Basic Energy Plan makes some significant changes to the targets in the
previous plan, which was released in 2016 and approved by the Cabinet in July 2018.
METI describes the update as an “ambitious outlook” for energy supply in 2030 on a
pathway to achieving the government’s announced target of net-zero carbon
emissions by 2050. It is certainly an ambitious outlook for the electricity generation
sector, which is one of Japan’s main sources of green-house gas emissions since the
Fukushima disaster, when subsequently power from nuclear reactors was mostly
replaced with thermal capacity.

The new 2030 Plan targets a reduction in GHG emissions of 46% compared with a
baseline of 2013, which is a major upgrade on the previously cited 26% reduction.
This is to be achieved largely through increasing the share of carbon free sources of
power (renewables, nuclear and, to a minor extent, hydrogen and ammonia) from 24%
in 2019 to between 57% and 71% in 2030 at the expense of fossil-fuels, where a
decline from 76% in 2019 to 41% in 2030 is targeted.
Nuclear’s share remains unchanged from the 2016 Plan despite continued opposition
from the public and the technical, safety and security problems that power utilities have
faced in restarting most of the 33 potentially operable nuclear plants.

The more than doubling of renewables, currently 40% of which is from hydro, is similarly
challenging, given the difficulty of finding suitable locations for solar power and onshore
and offshore wind turbines.

LNG is the fossil fuel facing the largest reduction in its share of the power mix, with a
decline from the actual 37% in 2019 (and the envisaged 27% according to the previous
plan) to 20% in the new plan.
Looking at what that means in terms of import numbers, in 2019, Japan brought in
77.23 million tons (mt) of LNG, according to official figures. Of that, 50.63 mt was
ordered by the power utilities.

If LNG had met 20% of electricity demand in 2019 rather than the actual 37%, the power
companies would have imported 27.3 mt, or 23.3 mt less. That’s equivalent to 6.6% of
global imports.

Japan’s LNG pedigree
Japan has been the world’s largest and most influential LNG player over the last 50
years. It started importing LNG from Alaska in 1969. By the mid-70s, it was the world’s
largest importer, and by the mid-80s Japan accounted for 75% of global LNG
imports.

Most of the LNG projects in the Pacific basin were launched with Japan as the main
market and, in the Middle East both ADNOC LNG and Qatargas phase 1 were
developed to supply the growing Japanese market.

The traditional Japan Crude Cocktail (JCC) indexed LNG price formula was
negotiated by Japanese buyers and was adopted by other buyers in Asia. Many LNG
developers have targeted contracts with Japanese buyers because they are reliable,
experienced and creditworthy partners, which supported the raising of project finance
and put them in a position to take a final investment decision (FID).
This year, however, Japan’s hegemony was challenged. China became the largest
LNG importer having taken delivery of around 2 mt more than Japan in the first nine
months of the year. The gap will further widen rapidly as Chinese appetite for LNG
grows while Japan’s domestic demand stagnates along the lines of the new energy
plan.

Japanese buyers have been largely absent from the market for new supply in the last
two years, signing no new long-term contracts in 2020 and committing to only around
1.5 million tons per annum (mtpa) in 2019. Long-term contracts with ADNOC LNG
and Malaysia LNG have been renewed in reduced volumes, and negotiations over the
extension of the 6 mtpa of contracts with Qatargas, which expire at the end of 2021,
have not yet been concluded. The outcome, at best, will probably be a reduction of
the volumes. But it’s possible that some of the contracts will be allowed to expire.
As a result, Japan will likely become a price follower in the Asian market rather than
being a price setter. Japanese officials have often urged LNG producers to accept
pricing based on the country’s demand-supply dynamics, but with a 10% global
market share it will be that much harder for the country to use its market conditions as
benchmarks for the wider Asia market.

What’s more, even METI’s own calculations indicate that as existing gas fields around
the world are depleted, from 2028 there will be more tightness in the market unless
new projects get the green light. That will make procurement even harder and if
Japanese firms are not some of the key investors in the new projects, their volume
demands will slip down the pecking order.



Future outlook

The upside for LNG demand in Japan could come from nuclear and renewables failing
to reach the ambitious targets in the new plan. That would put pressure on Japan to
make sure that what it uses to generate power is as low in emissions as possible,
favoring regasified LNG over coal.
In that sense, recent comments by Hosaka Shin, Commissioner of ANRE (Agency for
Natural Resources and Energy, part of METI) has probably given producers some
hope that there is upside to imports beyond the decline envisaged in the targets for
power generation.

“LNG is an essential balancing fuel to achieve carbon neutrality even as the country
leans more on renewables,” Hosaka said at the METI-hosted annual Producer-
Consumer conference on October 5. “Natural gas/LNG as the source material for
hydrogen and ammonia will remain important even beyond carbon neutrality in
2050.”

Furthermore, Hosaka’s statement that “the goal remains for Japanese companies to
be buying 100 million tons of LNG year by 2030 to meet domestic and overseas
demand” suggests that Japan’s LNG buyers will have a wider role in the Asian market
than just securing LNG supply to meet demand in Japan.
Japan clearly hopes to retain its influence on LNG pricing and contracts as the fuel
remains a significant part of its own energy mix and as a basis for infrastructure
exports. Managing that influence while being in control of the demand for only half of
its import volumes (i.e., the domestic market) will prove a new challenge for Japan,
albeit one which opens new opportunities.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Renewable energy
AC Energy Corporation (ACEN) obtained board approval to increase ownership in
UPC\AC Renewables Australia to 100%, giving the company full control over a
pipeline of renewable energy projects that includes Australia’s largest solar farm. The
$243 million acquisition needs regulatory approval, which if given, would be ACEN’s
first wholly-owned development and operations platform outside of its home in the
Philippines.

Battery storage/ breakthrough
Engineers at University of Newcastle in Australia have patented a material that stores
thermal energy in a block that weighs about 6 kilos. The bricks are known as
Miscibility Gap Alloys (MGAs), and are made from aluminum and graphite. Each block
can store about 1 kWh of energy generated from renewable sources, and is said to be
functional and durable for about 30 years.

“Green” steel/ BMW
Starting in 2025, BMW Group will purchase steel from Swedish startup H2 Green Steel
for its factories in Europe. The German automaker’s goal is to reduce CO emissions in
2
its steel supply chain by about 2 million tons by 2030. H2 Green Steel uses hydrogen
and clean energy to make steel; mass production begins in 2024. The production of
‘green steel’ has about 95% less GHG emissions than steel made using coal.
Climate finance/ investment fund
Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and former Goldman Sachs executive David Blood
have launched a new management firm, named Just Climate, to finance net-zero
carbon projects. The firm has financial backing from Microsoft and Ireland’s sovereign
wealth fund, and will invest in solutions to help limit increases in global temperatures.
This isn’t the duo’s first environmental financial venture. In 2004, Gore and Blood set
up Generation Investment Management.

ESG/ Royal Dutch Shell
Activist hedge fund Third Point, led by billionaire Daniel Loeb, has accused Royal
Dutch Shell of having an “incoherent” strategy on how to decarbonize operations and
transition to clean energy. Loeb is urging the company to split itself into “multiple
standalone companies”, including one that’s focused on oil and gas. Third Point is
reported to have an estimated $750 million stake in Shell, which itself has an
approximate $190 billion market cap.

France/ Nuclear
In a report on how to meet future electricity demand, France’s grid operator, RTE,
said next-gen nuclear reactors can play a crucial role in transitioning the country's
energy sector away from fossil fuels. "Building new nuclear reactors is economically
viable… and it’s possible to maintain a fleet of around 40 GW in 2050," said the RTE
report. It’s expected that by year’s end President Macron will announce the
construction of six new EPR nuclear reactors.

Indonesia/ Coal
Thanks to surging Chinese power demand, Indonesia is enjoying record coal prices
that have soared to $150 per ton, up from about $90 per ton in early June. Southeast
Asia’s biggest economy is now China’s leading overseas supplier of coal, with imports
hitting a record of more than 21 million tons in September, up from 17 million tons in
August. Last year, China banned Australian coal and instead agreed to buy $1.5
billion of coal from Indonesia this year.

UK/ Tidal energy
The £1.7 billion Blue Eden tidal lagoon project in Swansea will have modern
underwater turbines with a capacity of 320 MW, as well as floating solar power. A
battery facility will store the renewable energy and power the entire site. Construction
starts in early 2023. Blue Eden will be the world's largest facility of its kind when fully
operational by 2032. The Tidal Range Alliance says that tidal power generation could
supply 5% to 10% of the UK’s energy needs.

U.S./ Offshore wind
Spain’s wind turbine giant, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, and Dominion
Energy will invest $200 million to build a blade factory in the State of Virginia. The
blades will be used to build the offshore Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project
(CVOW). Expected to be finished in 2025, the 32-hectare CVOW will have 180
turbines, each 245 meters in height, and will generate 2.6 GW. It will be the largest
offshore wind farm in the U.S.

U.S./ Wind
Enel Green Power North America, a leading developer, owner and operator of
renewable energy plants, has started building the 25 Mile Creek wind farm in the
State of Oklahoma. The 250 MW facility consists of 60 turbines that will be operational
in late 2022. This is Enel Green’s twelfth wind farm in Oklahoma, where it has a wind
portfolio worth more than $3 billion. Across the U.S., the company has over 2.5 GW of
new wind and solar capacity under construction.
