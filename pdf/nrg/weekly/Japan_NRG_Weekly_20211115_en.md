NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Japan kicks off debate on $265 billion stimulus including batteries and chip factories

(Nikkei Asia, Nov. 9)
•  The Japanese government kicked off discussions on a ¥30 trillion ($265 billion) stimulus package
for PM Kishida’s council on a "new capitalism". This includes ¥10 trillion for universities to support
storage batteries and mass production of electric-vehicle batteries
•  Development of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) was also proposed, as well as aid for a new
semiconductor device plant by Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC in Kumamoto.
•  The government will finalize the new stimulus measures as early as Nov. 19, and then pass a

supplementary budget in December.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kishida new capitalism advisors call for more priority for green and clean energy
(Japan NRG, Nov. 8)
o  The Kishida cabinet panel on “new capitalism” proposed advancing development of
cutting-edge technologies in digitization, as well as “green” and “clean energy”, as
strategic areas to boost the national economy. The panel advisors called for making

science and technology Japan’s backbone.
o  The key research and development areas were identified as digitalization, AI, quantum
computing, bio and space technologies. The panel also urged the spread of digital
transformation and clean energy supply systems, which are comprised of renewables,
domestic production of storage batteries, hydrogen vehicles and infrastructures,
alternative energy sources for carbon-intensive chemical and steel industries,

decarbonization of homes and building structures, and development of nuclear fusion.
o  The 15-member panel is comprised of representatives of Japan Business Federation,
Chamber of Commerce, Z-Holdings, Shionogi, and Japanese Trade Union
Confederation; but the energy sector is not represented.
• TAKEAWAY: The panel proposal seems to categorize “clean energy” as something available in the near term,
while “green energy” is decades away. This is a shift that Japan NRG has commented on previously – Kishida’s
replacement of Suga’s “green” with “clean”. We understand this to mean less emphasis on renewables in

order to allude also to carbon capture, nuclear and hydrogen.



New Environment Minister discusses joint efforts with Keidanren deputy chief

(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 8)
•  Environment Minister Yamaguchi met with Sugimori Tsutomu, vice chairman of the Keidanren
(Japan Business Federation) and chairman of ENEOS.
•  Minister Yamaguchi said: “I’d like to join hands with the Keidanren to realize a virtuous cycle
between the economy and the environment.”
•  Sugimori responded: "Amid the difficult situation around nuclear power and other issues, there’s a
major need to work closely and share knowledge on how to create a virtuous cycle between the

economy and the environment.”
•  The meeting was held around the theme of COP26.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: This is the first time the new Environment Minister has met with the big business lobby,
which traditionally has supported nuclear energy over renewables.
• TAKEAWAY: Yamaguchi’s predecessor, Koizumi, made his position on energy very clear. He fully supported
renewable energy and pushed back against nuclear power. Yamaguchi’s position is yet to be fully seen, with
many in the renewables industry concerned that the new minister may favor the nuclear lobby. It’s curious that

the Keidanren’s top rep opened with mention of nuclear and the economy.



METI opens Green Innovation Fund applications for batteries and vehicle motors

(Japan NRG, Nov. 11)
•  METI opened applications to companies and consortiums for its Green Innovation Fund to develop
battery and motor systems for vehicles.
•  A total of up to ¥151 billion will be provided for the development of solid state and other new
batteries; cutting cobalt consumption used for cathodes and graphite used for anodes; reducing
carbon emissions while treating battery raw materials; recycling 70% of lithium, 95% of nickel and

95% of cobalt from spent lithium-ion storage batteries; improving performance of motors,
downsizing and reducing weight.
•  The application deadline is Jan. 6; winners will be announced in late February.
• TAKEAWAY: High prices of critical raw materials, driven by looming supply shortages, propel more investment
in recycling and development of alternative materials. Increases in secondary supplies may dampen prices a
little, but news of replacement materials is likely to have the bigger impact with the premise of possibly turning
the supply-demand balance around. Intermediate brokers that do not directly consume the materials will stop

buying them.
• The market will also be looking for the least carbon-intensive supplies. Recycling does not involve long haul
transport of materials as waste is typically treated within the country of consumption. Primary materials travel

across continents before reaching battery makers.


METI minister holds online talks with Saudi Arabian energy minister

(Japan NRG, Nov. 9)
•  METI minister Hagiuda and Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman held an
online meeting on Nov. 8, four days after Abdulaziz said he hadn’t received any request from
Japan to ramp up oil output at a faster pace.
•  CONTEXT: Saudi Arabia is Japan’s second largest oil supplier after the United Arab Emirates, with
a 30-40% share.
• TAKEAWAY: Saudi Arabia seeks to increase foreign direct investment in a bid to diversify its economy and

decrease dependency on oil. In February, the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia was established for this
purpose. Thus, talks with Japan on oil production are unlikely to be limited to that topic.




Okinawa, Tokyo and Shikoku the most dependent regions on thermal power
(Japan NRG, Nov. 12)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  During the Golden Week holiday in May, thermal power accounted for 50-60% of electricity
demand in Okinawa, Tokyo and Shikoku areas, while the ratio was less than 20% for Kansai and
Kyushu due to the latter two region’s nuclear capacities.
•  May is when power demand hits yearly lows due to the holidays. Tokyo had renewable power
supplies of 15.3 GWh, the largest among all areas, but this was not enough to meet demand.

•  The panel seeks to lower the operating rate of thermal power stations by converting their systems
to run at 20-25% operating rates rather than the present minimum threshold of 30-50%.
•  Renewable operators are urged to connect to online supply monitoring systems for a faster
response to demand and supply changes.

ENEOS, Chiyoda scale up Australian CO2-Free Hydrogen Supply Chain Demonstration

(Company Statement, Nov. 2)
•  ENEOS, Chiyoda, and Queensland University of Technology (QUT) have expanded the scale of
technological verifications of CO2- free hydrogen to a practical level.
•  To store and transport hydrogen, previous technology required storing hydrogen produced via
water electrolysis in a tank, then converting it to methylcyclohexane (“MCH”), a type of organic
hydride. ENEOS’ technology simplifies this process by producing MCH from water and toluene
through the electro-chemical synthesis of organic hydride(Direct MCH).
•  In March 2019, ENEOS, Chiyoda and QUT produced MCH from water and toluene derived from

renewable energy; transporting MCH to Japan and then extracting hydrogen.
•  Now, the scale of MCH has expanded to contain about 6 kg of hydrogen from the previous 0.2 kg.
Hydrogen is also extracted from MCH technology, where it’s used to fill and drive a fuel cell
electric vehicle (FCEV).


Mitsui to introduce Ammonia fuel-ready carrier at the end of 2023

(Nikkei, Nov. 7)
•  Mitsui & Co. will deliver a ship that transports ammonia and that can switch to using ammonia for
its own fuel in Dec. 2023. The ship will transport ammonia from Southeast Asia to Northeast Asia,
primarily Japan.
•  The new vessel will be 160 meters long, with a depth of 15.9 meters.
•  Once completed, it will be the first environmentally friendly unit owned by a Japanese shipping

company that can switch between LPG fuel and ammonia fuel.

•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), the shipping company, aims to place an order for an ammonia-fueled
ship in 2023.
•  This will also be the world’s first ammonia carrier to be designed and built based on the American
Bureau of Shipping (ABS) certification.



Japan's Erex and South Korea's Samsung C&T to partner on clean fuel development
(Nikkei Asia, Nov. 4)
•  Erex (Japan) and Samsung C&T (South Korea) will partner on biomass and establish a global supply
chain for cleaner fuels.
•  Erex plans to buy coal-run power plants from major utilities and refit them for biomass fuel. This is

part of Erex’s campaign to convert aging coal plants to run on biomass.
•  Erex aims to boost annual procurement of biomass fuel to 3-5m tons in 2025 and to 10m tons in
2030. Currently, it produces about 1m tons.


Japan firm develops geothermal power module that doesn’t require rare metal

(Nikkei, Nov. 10)
•  Hakusan, a company that handles electronic components, developed a geothermal power
generation module that doesn’t use rare metals, reducing raw material costs by one-fourth
compared to conventional products.
•  Hakusan aims to mass-produce and commercialize this in 2022, offering its module for half the
price of similar products that do use rare metals.


MOL, Mitsubishi, and Namura Shipbuilding in ammonia carrier joint development

(Seatrade Maritime News, Nov. 4)
•  Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and Namura Shipbuilding will develop a large-
sized ammonia carrier, fueled by ammonia.

J-Power plans a giant 142 MW onshore wind project in Yamaguchi/Shimane Prefecture

(Nikkei, Nov. 10)
•  CONTEXT: J-Power is the No. 2 wind power producer in Japan with capacity of about 530 MW.
•  J-Power plans to build a wind farm with a total output of up to 142 MW in the area between
Yamaguchi and Shimane prefectures.
•  The estimated project area is 10,175 hectares in Shunan City and Iwakuni City, and (Yamaguchi
Prefecture) and Yoshika town (Shimane Prefecture).
•  J-Power plans to install 33 wind power facilities each with a maximum output of 4.3 MW.
Construction expected to last for 4-5 years.

• TAKEAWAY: Much criticized for its heavy dependence on coal-fired generation, J-Power is capitalizing on its
wind power base to announce a significant shift to green power. Onshore wind in Japan is still a small sector
that measures less than 5 GW of capacity. J-Power’s project may be unable to compete in scale with offshore
wind efforts but it would be a notable development on land and one clearly backed by the government.



FIT on-shore wind auction awarded at ¥14.98 to ¥17 per kWh, biomass at ¥18.50
(Japan NRG, Nov. 5)
•  The 2021 renewable power auctions awarded 32 onshore wind operators with tariffs of ¥14.98-17/
kWh and one biomass operator a tariff of ¥18.50/ kWh, reports Green Investment Promotion

Organization (GIPO). The results will set renewable rates under the Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) scheme.
GIPO sought to auction 1 GW of onshore wind power and 120 MW of biomass power.
•  Some 44 onshore wind projects went to auction. The lowest bid of ¥14.98/ kWh came from Tokyo-
based wind power operator Reetech. Hokuriku Electric Power followed at ¥15.48/ kWh. Nagoya-
based SunWay bid the highest at ¥17/ kWh, which was also the level of the price cap. Some 29
other winners included Tohoku Electric Power, Japan Renewable Energy, ENEOS and Cosmo Eco
Power. The sole biomass entrant was Oji Green Power Ebetsu in Hokkaido, that bid at ¥18.50/kWh,

the price cap. The company has a capacity of 75 MW, below the 120 MW target.
•  This was the first onshore wind power auction, and the fourth for biomass. The last biomass tender
was awarded also at ¥18.50/kWh. Wind operators with capacities of a minimum of 250 kW, and
biomass operators with a minimum of 10 MW capacities, were eligible. The bids were placed in
late October.
• TAKEAWAY: Participation remains the key for successful auctions and healthy market mechanism. In 2020, 1.92
MW biomass capacity was sourced against the target of 120 MW. There were no winners in the 2018 and 2019

tenders due to a lack of participants and one potential winner being disqualified. While the first onshore power
auction was successful hitting the 1 GW target, the offshore fixed foundation wind power auction, which was
held last year, failed to attract bidders.

(Company Statement, Oct. 29)
•  Sumitomo Corp Global Metals, Shell, Equinor, Toda Construction and Ocean Winds, a JV between
EDP Renewables and ENGIE, said they formed an industry lobby group to press for changes in

Japan’s offshore wind power industry.
•  Floating Offshore Wind Promotion Group, as the lobby is known, is asking the Japanese
government to set a target of 2-3 GW of floating wind power capacity by 2030, and for medium
and long-term targets.
•  The group wants the government to create dedicated committees to discuss floating offshore wind
issues and to chart a clear path towards the creation of a suitable business environment, including

towards development in the EEZ.


NUCLEAR REACTOR ROUND-UP:
Local mayor approves Ikata nuclear plant’s restart
(Yahoo news, Nov. 11)

o  The mayor of Ikata met with the operator, expressing his approval in restarting the Ikata
Unit 3 reactor (Shikoku Electric).
o  As a next step, the operator will meet with Special Committee members from Ehime
Prefecture assembly, on Nov. 16.
o  Governor Nakamura has indicated that he will make his final decision based on the
opinions of the prefectural assembly.
o  The plant’s restart, scheduled for Oct. 12, was delayed after an operator left his post

several times while on standby duty.
o  Work on anti-terrorism safety measures has been completed.
• TAKEAWAY: Ikata No. 3 looks like it may restart at the end of this month or early December, providing the rest
of the local politics go its way. This would be a major event as it’d be the first time in years that a reactor
outside of Kansai Electric or Kyushu Electric was online.

o  Under new regulations, a plant can’t restart if there’s an active fault underneath.


Power utilities concerned over loss of major clients such as Sony to PPA deals

(Diamond, Nov. 9)
•  There’s a growing trend for large electricity users to get into power generation. In September,
Mitsubishi Corp signed a long-term power purchase agreement (corporate PPA) with Amazon. The
agreement calls for the construction of about 450 new solar power plants, with all the electricity
generated by the plants to be consumed by Amazon.
•  Total installed capacity is 22 MW. This is Amazon's first PPA in Japan, and the country’s largest.
•  Corporate PPAs are well established in Europe and the U.S. as a way to directly control renewable

energy supplies without relying on state subsidies such as the Feed-in Tariff (FIT).
•  Such PPAs will play a lead role in Japan's electricity market. A senior executive at a major electric
power company expressed his dismay, saying, "From now on, unless we have a large amount of

Kansai Electric mulls LNG cargo swaps, procurement with Korea’s POSCO
(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 8)
•  Kansai Electric will consider working with POSCO Energy, a major steel group in South Korea, in
areas such as in LNG swaps.
•  Specific details will be discussed later. The two companies will consider joint participation in LNG

procurement, power generation and LNG terminal projects.

Japan Joins Race to Develop Green Tech
That Sucks CO2 Out of the atmosphere

With more and more countries saying that decreasing greenhouse gas emissions isn’t
enough to combat climate change, the idea of Direct Air Capture (DAC) has gained
traction as a solution to cut atmospheric levels of CO2.

Japan initially ignored DAC as a theoretical technology that seemed less promising
than Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This year, however, that stance changed.
Not wishing to be left behind in global green innovation, the Cabinet Office launched
an ambitious R&D initiative that includes efforts to create technology that pulls more
CO2 out of the atmosphere than it emits.

For now, Japan is simply catching up. There are 15 DAC pilot plants already operating
in the world, mostly led by startups in Switzerland (Climeworks), Canada (Carbon
Engineering), U.S. (Global Thermostat), and the UK (Center for Negative Carbon
Emissions), according to the IEA. Together they suck more than 9,000 Mt of CO2 from
the atmosphere each year. Climeworks switched on the world’s biggest DAC plant
just two months ago.

Still, Japan believes it can catch up and become a world leader by developing its own
approach. The country’s DAC research is led by several groups of major scientific
institutions and universities that are looking at ways to capture CO2 from discarded
energy or via membrane separation, among other ideas. Armed with ample
government funding, Japan could yet become a serious contender in the DAC arena.


Carbon Capture isn't enough
Until recently, Japan’s CO2 reduction strategy focused on collecting the emissions at
source, such as by installing a carbon capture system at a thermal power plant.
Among the standout projects was the group effort led by Toshiba, which in October
2020 installed the world’s first carbon capture system at a biomass plant.

The Mikawa power station in Fukuoka Prefecture runs a system known as BECCS (Bio
Energy Carbon Capture and Storage), which collects over 50% of total emissions, or
about 500 tons of CO2 daily.

More installations like that could make a significant contribution, but they’re unlikely
to gather all the CO2 being released. This led the government to seriously consider
developing DAC as a technology that could not only suck up the CO2 that CCS
systems cannot but also allow Japan eventually to aim for a negative carbon footprint.

Mastering DAC will not be easy. Part of the challenge in directly removing CO2 from
the atmosphere is its low level of concentration. While average CO2 concentration
from factory emissions reaches about 10% to 15%, in a regular setting CO2 only
accounts for 0.04% of the atmosphere. This makes DAC more challenging than CCS.

How DAC could work is still under development but there are several potential
approaches being considered. The main DAC research directions the Japanese
government wants to explore are:

•  Separation of CO2 through chemical absorption
•  Membrane separation, which involves separation of CO2 through ion exchange membranes
•  Deep cooling, whereby CO2 is made into dry ice


DAC research finally launches
All major technological leaps require major resources as well as policy. That’s why this
year the Cabinet Office officially launched a ¥115-billion “Moonshot Research &
Development Program” as a way to support work to create technologies that could
be provisionally functional by 2030 and fully commercialized by 2050.

There are seven research projects within the ‘Moonshot’ program that relate to DAC:

6 Integrated fixed reaction system (qua-C system) that can use standby CO2 Tohoku University

7 CO2 circulation system                         Kyushu University

The approaches are all quite different and there is a
lack of detailed information on many of them.

One interesting project, however, is being pursued
by Nagoya University and Toho Gas, a gas utility
based in Nagoya. The two seek to develop
technology that utilizes cold energy created when
natural gas is cooled to -160°C to make LNG. This
cold energy is discarded when the liquid fuel is
converted back into gas, but researchers at Nagoya
want to put it to good use.

The idea is to absorb CO2 via a chemical solution
and then use cold energy to turn the gas into dry

cryogenics. So far, it has only been tested successfully in a lab, but the researchers
aim to scale it up to a demonstration plant within the next 10 years.

Capturing CO2 with membranes
Another approach is being taken by researchers at Kyushu University’s International
Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (I2CNER), who are working with
NanoMembrane Technologies, a venture that specializes in the commercialization of
nano-membrane technology.

Their idea is to develop a system that captures CO2 with the aid of membranes and
subsequently converts the captured gas into useful chemicals. The membrane that the
researchers are working with is about 34 nanometers thin, which is about 1/300th of
the thickness of a food wrap.

Membranes can capture CO2 using tiny air holes that
allow the gas to enter. However, applying membrane
separation in DAC has long been a challenge due to the
air’s aforementioned low CO2 concentration.

The four-stage membrane separation technology created
by Kyushu University and NanoMembrane Technologies
can increase CO2 concentration from up to the 40% level,
which is sufficient for subsequent conversions.
Source: Kyushu University

Fujikawa Shigenori, an associate professor at Kyushu University’s I2CNER and the
current project manager, explains the significance of this membrane-based DAC
system (m-DAC) as technology that enables CO2 capture to take place any time and
any place. In theory, it could be installed in homes, schools, shops and regular
housing, in a manner similar to a photovoltaic system.


What about the cost?
Of course, the main challenge for commercializing DAC is cost. Most DAC techniques
use amine, a chemical mixture that acts as a solvent to capture atmospheric CO2.
Amine absorbs the gas before being heated to allow for the separation and removal
of CO2. The amine process required very large facilities, which leads to high
operational costs.

According to the Center for Low Carbon Society Strategy (LCS), a national research
think-tank of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), as of 2020 the
domestic cost for DAC stands at around ¥35.4/ kg-CO2. The largest cost item is the
equipment, which accounts for 58% of total.

On a global level, Japan’s DAC costs appear to be somewhere in the middle. Projects
around the world run at a cost level of about $250 to $600 per ton of CO2 depending
on the scale of the DAC plant.

A second challenge is the high energy volumes required to power DAC systems,
which also need substantial amounts of heat to separate the CO2 from the capture
medium. In this regard, Japan has a relative advance. While existing DAC pilot plants
overseas require a lot of energy, Japan’s technology captures and separates CO2 at
low temperatures, which also allows for the installation of smaller-scale DAC plants, an
appropriate option for a country with a high percentage of land covered by mountains
or forest.

| the thickness of a food wrap. |

But perhaps Japan’s biggest challenge in the DAC space will be storage. Whether it is
CCS or DAC, the captured CO2 needs a large geological repository and identifying
one on Japanese territory has proved difficult. Any such site needs to have low risk of
CO2 leakage and serve for the very long term.

That’s why Yamaji Kenji, the director of the national Moonshot program, stresses that
the DAC project must aim not only to remove the CO2 but find a use for it in new
materials and fuels. Whether in the form of dry-ice or as chemicals for industrial
processes, the CO2 should have a practical value after it’s separated from the
atmosphere.

Japan was one of the first countries to outline a vision for a hydrogen economy. To
succeed with DAC technology, the country will need to come up with another bold
and innovative vision for an economy based on CO2.



Beyond Moonshot

Separate from the Moonshot program, Japanese engineering giant IHI Corp. has recently
developed a small-scale DAC plant that captures CO2 from the air at its lab in the Soma IHI
Green Energy Center.

IHI captures CO2 by first using an amine solution to solidify and dry the CO2 particle.
Then, the amine is used to act as a membrane to cover and absorb the CO2. Once
absorbed from the air, the CO2 is heated to separate the particles.

The captured CO2 from the DAC plant will be used to generate a 400 m2 hydroponic
facility where the CO2 is supplied to plants through a pipe. IHI plans to further develop this
technology to build a DAC plant that’s smaller but with improved performance, and by the
end of 2022 wants to have a fully operational factory with negative CO2 emissions.

JOGMEC Profile:
Japan’s State Oilmen Stick to Old Principles in a New Role

While most clean energy focus falls on what’s above ground, in fact, what’s happening
below the surface will in large part determine the success of the Clean Energy
Revolution.

Building electric vehicles, solar plants, wind turbines, and many other components of
the energy transition will require access to vast quantities of minerals, some of which
are hard to find, and nearly all of which Japan needs to secure outside its borders.

The role of securing that supply has fallen to a state-backed corporation traditionally
tasked with procuring Japan’s oil and gas. Now, JOGMEC will need to use its prowess
in prospecting deep below the Earth’s surface to deliver the minerals required to
power Japan’s decarbonization.

However, an entity that’s forged its reputation in fossil fuels also has its
own views on the new energy landscape, and not all of JOGMEC’s
experts believe that a radical energy shift is the best way to go.


Changing role for the oilmen
Two major state entities direct Japan’s energy development. One is The
New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, or
NEDO. As its title suggests, NEDO tends to focus on developments in
“new” energy fields, such as renewables and green hydrogen.

The other entity is the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation
(JOGMEC), and true to its name the administrative agency-cum-
corporation grew out of a need for Japan, once the world’s Top 3 oil
buyer, to secure vast quantities of hydrocarbons. In 2004, JOGMEC’s
predecessor, the Japan National Oil Corporation, merged with the Japan
Metal Industry Development Corporation, forming JOGMEC and officially
broadening its scope from oil to mining.

As a sign of the times, JOGMEC’s budget for FY2020 was ¥19.5 billion,

The law under which JOGMEC operates was revised and approved in June 2020. It
added new mandates, including the procurement of fuel for Japan’s power generators
in times of emergency, investment or other financial support for overseas mining and
metals smelting, and also natural gas storage.


National stockpiles of key materials
As part of its new role, JOGMEC will also take charge of stockpiling critical raw
materials (CRMs). Japan lists 34 types of metals and minerals, including rare earth
metals lithium and cobalt, as CRMs because they are indispensable for manufacturing
magnets for EV motors and electronic components for semiconductors. Japan imports
nearly all of the volumes it requires and JOGMEC is tasked with creating an inventory
sufficient enough for at least 60 to 180 days of domestic consumption, depending on
the metal. The exact target numbers are secret.

Partly prompted by the 2010 trade issues with China, JOGMEC has teamed up with
Japanese trading house Sojitz to provide a $250 million loan to Australia’s Lynas Corp,
the biggest rare earth producer and processor outside of China. Further investments
followed. In 2016, the two Japanese entities partially cut debt obligations to Lynas
and then in 2020 JOGMEC further injected capital of $425 million into the Australian
firm to help it compete with Chinese rivals.

The urgency around CRMs is rising. Earlier this year, a person familiar with the matter
told Bloomberg that China may ban the export of rare-earths refining technology to
countries or companies that it deems a threat. Asia’s most populous nation could also
ban or restrict shipments of rare earths in case of a trade war, among other reasons,
the person said.

In response, Japan is trying to accelerate the potential development of both deep-sea
mining and seabed mining. In the summer of 2020, JOGMEC conducted the world’s
first successful excavation of cobalt from the ocean floor, collecting 649 kilograms of
mineral-rich seabed crust. Part of the seabed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone
(EEZ) is rich in cobalt and nickel, two essential components for EV batteries and other
green tech.

Japanese estimates show the EEZ seabed contains enough cobalt to meet Japan’s
demand for 88 years and enough nickel for 12 years.


Digging deep for green energy
JOGMEC’s expanded role doesn’t stop with securing CRMs, and in April, it unveiled
the Action Plan on Carbon Neutrality, in which, alongside measures to support
upstream oil and gas development and LNG, the agency outlined plans to promote
geothermal energy.

Starting last fiscal year, JOGMEC began surveys of potential sites for new geothermal
stations in Japan, with five areas outside national parks under consideration. In total,
the state corporation plans to survey about 30 new sites, including in the national
parks located in Hokkaido, Niigata, Nagano, Kumamoto, and Oita.

Japan’s new energy strategy sees geothermal power’s role in the energy mix at least
doubling to about 1% of the total by FY2030.
Outside of its foray into renewables, JOGMEC is also part of the Japanese
government’s push to create a hydrogen society. The agency was not previously
tasked with working on ammonia and hydrogen projects, which were considered to be
NEDO’s territory. However, the latest Basic Energy Plan, approved by the Cabinet this
October, states that !JOGMEC will contribute to carbon neutrality through the
introduction and expansion of decarbonized fuels and technologies such as hydrogen,
ammonia, and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), in addition to the stable and low-
cost supply of oil, natural gas, and metal mineral resources”.

The Plan specifies that !JOGMEC will review its role and consider strengthening its
functions, such as the supply of risk money and technological demonstrations, to
contribute to carbon neutrality”.

An additional amendment to the law under which JOGMEC governs is being
considered to officially bring hydrogen and ammonia projects within its remit.
JOGMEC is already studying potential investments in ammonia production in four
countries, including Russia and Indonesia.


Opposition to a complete energy shift
Despite JOGMEC’s new role in the energy transition, the agency’s 625 staff don’t
necessarily agree that the industry must change entirely. At heart, JOGMEC remains
an entity with strong roots in the hydrocarbon community.

A top official in charge of fossil fuel procurement at JOGMEC says today’s criticism of
fossil fuels is over-done. “I think there needs to be some kind of alternative force to
the critical trends sweeping from Europe,” he said, noting that more voices from Asian
countries should be heard in the global energy debate. !For example, we can still use
coal but [make sure it is done] in the cleanest way possible; or, we can use natural gas
but focus on projects that emit as little CO2 as possible at the production stage.”

“I think the time has come for us to communicate a kind of code of conduct for Asia
that includes carbon recycling, considerations around economic growth and around
stable energy supply,” the JOGMEC official added.

To be clear, JOGMEC continues to be a major investor in oil and gas projects and
recently played a role in bringing more clarity to LNG supply contracts for Japanese
companies. For example, JOGMEC is involved in the $20 billion Mozambique LNG
project, which is on pause at the moment due to local unrest.

The agency provided about 75% of the ¥300-400 billion invested by Japanese
companies in the Arctic LNG 2 project led by Russian natural gas firm Novatek in the
Yamal Peninsula. That project is expected to produce 19.8 million tons of LNG per
year starting in 2023.

Also, JOGMEC is applying its sea-mining knowledge to promote development of
methane hydrate deposits in Japanese waters. The crystal-like solid could become a
major source of gas since it’s found in large quantities in the eastern Nankai Trough
area and in the Japan Sea. Known as !flammable ice”, methane hydrate is a frozen mix

of water and natural gas formed under high pressure and low temperatures in
permafrost or on the seafloor.

In the Basic Plan for Ocean Policy approved by the Cabinet in 2018,
commercialization of methane hydrate is seen by 2027, although the government has
recently mulled bringing forward this target. JOGMEC is working in this sphere
together with private oil and gas companies and engineering firms.

For many at JOGMEC, the future of energy doesn’t need to be entirely “new” and
even the development of alternative sources such as hydrogen makes better sense as
an extension of the current energy infrastructure.

Speaking to the media last year, JOGMEC President Hosono said: !There are still
many technical and economic issues to be resolved before we can secure stable and
safe hydrogen supply. Until we find an innovative way to supply hydrogen through
technological innovation, the most efficient and shortest route is to extract hydrogen
from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas.”

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Bitcoin/ Nuclear power
Nuclear energy has “tremendous opportunity” for the energy-intensive Bitcoin mining
industry, said a panel of top crypto-currency executives during the “Bitcoin & Beyond
Virtual Summit”. Previous discussions about Bitcoin and renewable energy have
focused on solar and wind power, not nuclear. “What we’d love to see is an
expansion of nuclear power,” said Harry Sudock, vice president of Griid, a U.S.
company that procures renewable energy for Bitcoin mining.

Brazil/ Wind and Solar power
Equatorial Energia will pay €1 billion to buy wind developer Echoenergia, which has
built and operates wind farms in Brazil, with a total of 1 GW of installed
capacity. Echoenergia has another 200 MW under construction and a portfolio of
planned projects with capacity of 1.1 GW, consisting of 90% solar and 10% wind. In
related news, Essentia Energia began operations of its 475 MW solar power plant in
Brazil’s state of Bahia.

Caribbean & Africa/ Renewables
London-based PASH Global Management will invest £1 billion in renewable energy
generation in the Caribbean Region, Africa and Latin America over the next five years.
PASH CEO Kofi Owusu Bempah says the company is building solar projects in Puerto
Rico, and it has a 50% stake in a 50 MW solar farm in Mali, the largest project of its
kind in West Africa. Among PASH's leading partners is the Swiss commodity trading
company Trafigura.

China/ Carbon emissions
The National Development and Reform Commission, China's main economic planner,
will promote low-carbon energy in heavy industry, agriculture, construction and
transportation. The main focus will be on 100 enterprises including steel,
petrochemicals, nonferrous metals and building materials; these generate the most
carbon emissions and pollution. Steel production in China last year emitted 15
percent of the country’s total carbon emissions.

Truck EVs/ IPO
EV truck maker Rivian ended its first day of trading with an $86 billion valuation,
putting the company among the top names in the auto industry. Backed by Amazon
and Ford Motor Co, Rivian is a decade old, but it only delivered a product this year —
156 pickup trucks. Coupled with TESLA’s trillion-dollar valuation, it’s clear that EVs are
a hot topic for investor, who believe in the market potential and are willing to pay a
premium for those deemed to have good leadership.
France/ Onshore Wind
German energy company RWE will expand its renewables portfolio in France,

investing in the 44 MW Les Nouvions onshore wind farm. Construction begins next
year and full operation begins in 2023. With 11 turbines, the wind farm will generate

enough electricity to meet the needs of about 23,000 households. In 2020, RWE
acquired an onshore wind and solar development pipeline in France of ~1.9 GW.

India/ Renewable energy
Indian billionaire Gautam Adani said he’ll invest $70 billion over the next decade to
build the world’s largest renewable energy company. Adani Green Energy, the world’s
largest solar developer, plans 45 GW of capacity by 2030. Adani Transmission, India’s
largest private sector power transmission and retail firm, wants to increase its share of
renewable power procurement from 3% to 30% by FY2023 and to 70% by FY2030.

Netherlands/ Offshore Wind
As part of efforts to meet the EU’s goal of a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030
over 1990 levels, the Netherlands said it’ll add another 10.7 GW of offshore wind
capacity this decade. The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management
published its North Sea Programme 2022 – 2027, which increases the country’s
offshore wind target from the current 11.5 GW to 22.2 GW of offshore wind capacity.

United Kingdom/ SMR reactors
Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources UK Limited and Exelon Generation Limited will
invest £195 million over three years to develop a 470 MW small modular reactor
(SMR), which should connect to the British grid in the early 2030s. This investment will
be matched with £210 million in UK Research and Innovation funding. A single Rolls-
Royce SMR power station will occupy the space of two football pitches and power
approximately 1 million homes.

USA/ Renewable energy
Entergy Mississippi will replace natural gas plants with 1 GW of renewable energy by
2027. In the next five years, the company’s power mix from renewables will increase
from less than 1% to nearly one-third of total. Natural gas currently makes up most of
the generation portfolio. In related news, Entergy Louisiana said it will purchase 475
MW of solar from four facilities across the state.

USA/ Oil prices
President Joe Biden faces growing pressure from fellow Democrats to address rising
gasoline prices. About a dozen Democratic senators urged Biden to help families and
small businesses, possibly banning exports for refined oil products to help force down
prices. However, a release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is considered
the most likely measure. U.S. oil exports often surpass 3 million barrels a day, more
than leading OPEC members.

USA/ Energy transition
General Electric will split into three publicly traded companies focusing on energy,
healthcare and aviation. The energy unit will combine existing wind and gas-fired
power turbines and services. The spinoff will be complete in 2024. “Customers need
GE at its best and at its most focused to help them navigate the energy transition,”
said GE CEO Larry Culp.

USA/Energy fraud
Jeff Carpool, owner of DC Solar, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for defrauding
investors of about $1 billion. Between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar made mobile solar
generators (MSGs). Federal tax credits were an incentive. Carpoff lied about market
demand, and made false financial statements and fake lease contracts. DC Solar sold

GLOBAL       VIEW:    COP26



COP26 Ran Out of Fuel in Week 2,
But Some Measures Will Have Lasting Impact

After a fairly substantive first week, the second half of the COP26 climate summit in
Glasgow ended up falling short of concrete achievements. The U.S. and China
unexpectedly announced a pact to work together to tackle climate issues, but the
declaration held few details. While this eventually may become a platform that'll have
larger ramifications later on, for now it’s hard to credit it with much.

One of the only major developments of the second week occurred this past weekend.
Close to 200 countries agreed to a new deal on climate action that aims to wean the
world off burning coal for power generation. Originally, the deal’s wording discussed
a “phase out” of coal power, the single biggest source of GHGs. Lobbying from
several major coal countries, however, saw that phrase altered to “phase down”.

The Japanese government is expected to welcome the looser language around the
use of coal that came from the Glasgow summit late on Saturday. India, South Africa
and China insisted on ‘phase-down’ rather than ‘phase-out’, and this was reflected in
the final Glasgow Climate Pact. The International Energy Agency still believes that
40% of the world’s coal plants should close by 2030.

COP26’s closing statement also called for a 45% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030,
and more robust, transparent and accountable international carbon markets. That
said, participating countries, including Japan, agreed to submit larger emissions
cutting pledges for 2030 when COP27 meets in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt in 2022.

COP26 also called for implementation of a global CO2 stocktake.

The agreement on coal was not the only fossil fuel measure reached at the summit.
The Glasgow Climate Pact called for accelerating the ‘phasing-down’ of "inefficient"
fossil fuel state subsidies. Coal, oil, and gas are estimated to currently receive $5.9
trillion of annual subsidies globally.

For Japan specifically, the impact from cutting state subsidies to hydrocarbon fuels
should be small, although it remains to be seen how the operations of JOGMEC
Corp, the state-backed agency in charge of oil and gas exploration and investment,
will be affected, as well as other other major players in that sector.

Of more importance to Japan will be the strengthening of adaptation finance
mechanisms to compensate the most vulnerable nations for ‘losses and damages’
caused by a changing climate, an area the Japanese government is expected to be
actively involved in. A specific Glasgow Dialogue was established to accelerate
finance-related action plans. The U.S. and the EU specifically refused to participate in
‘losses and damages’ finance mechanisms.

New rules for carbon markets
Opinion on the value of this will differ, but among major items at the summit's
conclusion was a deal to set out the rules for carbon credit markets. The final deal

allows nations to buy carbon credits that represent emission cuts achieved in other
countries to partially offset their own totals.

To avoid double-counting, Japan proposed that the country generating the credit
should have the right to decide whether the credit counts towards its own CO2 total
or if it's sold. If sold, the originator country cannot claim to have made the emissions
cut. This proposal was accepted.

This is a major “win” from a Japanese government standpoint, which sees credits
based on overseas projects helping to cover as much as a quarter of Japan’s CO2
reduction by 2030. Japan already runs the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), which is
a bilateral system that allows counting credits based on GHG cuts that Japanese firms
have made abroad.

Other nations such as Australia and Brazil will also be big beneficiaries of carbon
offsets.

As part of a separate system, 5% of the proceeds from trading carbon offsets will be
go to an adaptation fund for developing countries.
