NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Japan, Brazil leaders launch green partnership and promote biofuel-fueled hybrid vehicles
(Government statement, May 7)
•  During a May 3 meeting in Brazil, Prime Minister Kishida and President Lula launched the Initiative
for Sustainable Fuel and Mobility (ISFM), a framework to promote biofuels, e-fuels, and hybrid

engines.
•  They also launched the Japan-Brazil Green Partnership Initiative (GPI), which includes prevention of
Amazon deforestation and promoting sustainable agriculture.
•  Brazil’s food, energy and mineral resources offer opportunities for Japan. Kishida said he will
support investments in digital and green sectors.
•  CONTEXT: This agreement, which clarifies hybrid engine-mounted vehicles as climate solutions,

may open ways to expand the bioethanol-blended gasoline market in Japan. The bioethanol mix
ratio in Japanese gasoline is less than 2%, compared to over 10% in the U.S. and Europe.
• TAKEAWAY: In order for Japan’s bioethanol import market to grow, new entries are needed. The market is
dominated by Japan Biofuels Supply LLP, a joint venture of oil refineries. The importers will also need to
decide the mechanism to price bioethanol. This could be a basket of international price indices, a single
Japan-based price, or a combination of the two. This issue becomes important as bioethanol’s share in
gasoline increases. In that case, gasoline suppliers will need to explain to end-users the rationale behind price

changes.




ANRE proposes measures to reduce inefficient coal power, starting with FY2025 auction
(Government statement, May 8)
•  ANRE proposed measures to reduce inefficient coal power, including a cut in capacity auction
contract payments to operators supplying power from unabated plants.
•  This measure is set to be implemented from the FY2025 auction, with a 20% cut in payments from
OCCTO to power operators if unabated plants run above 50% rates.
•  The payment reduction for FY2026 onwards will be decided later.

•  CONTEXT: This past week’s G7 Climate Summit resolved to phase out existing unabated coal
power units in the first half of the 2030s. For its part, Japan plans to phase out “inefficient coal
power”, which are coal power plants with less than 43% energy efficiency, and will end the
construction of new unabated coal power units.
• TAKEAWAY: By FY2030, ANRE forecasts that inefficient coal plants will generate 39.7 TWh, which is down
significantly from 103 TWh in FY2022. ANRE also said these plants have average run rates of 67%.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI, environment ministers attend G7 Climate Summit
(Government statement, May 1)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  METI Minister Saito, Environment Minister Ito, and State Environment Minister Yagi
attended the G7 Climate Summit in Italy, with bilateral meetings at the sidelines.
o  Saito discussed:
▪  Net zero path in the transport sector, and nuclear development with the Italian
Minister of the Environment and Energy Security;
▪  Hydrogen, renewables, gas, CCUS, etc with the EU Energy Commissioner;
▪  Carbon pricing and CBAM with the EU Climate Commissioner.




METI to revise legislation on partial electric power supply for new market players
(Japan NRG, May 9)
•  METI and ANRE will create a new scheme to replace the "partial supply" system that effectively
obliges a deemed retail power utility (the retail arm of a former general electric utility, EPCO) to
make up for any shortfall in supply available to new market entrants (also known as shin denryoku

or PPSs).
•  The change would allow supply to come from two or more retail electricity providers if customers
desire. The proposal for a change comes amid concerns that the existing market will be distorted
and the expansion of off-site PPAs may be hindered.
•  The current partial supply scheme applies to shin denryoku that lack adequate access to power
sources. The system is claimed to be abused by some firms that used EPCO power when JEPX
prices in the market were high.
•  The system was established to promote renewables from new market players but has resulted in

the EPCOs losing money.
•  The govt is accepting public comments for the amendment proposal until June 15.



METI minister participates in Japan-EU economic security dialogue

(Government statement, May 2)
•  On May 2, METI Minister Saito participated in the 5th Japan-EU High-level Economic Dialogue with
focus on reinforcing economic security and resilience.
•  The ministers agreed to maintain WTO as the core of international trade rules and to jointly
address economic system vulnerabilities and to foster level playing fields.
•  Japan and the EU signed a protocol amending the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement to

include provision on the free-flow of data.
• TAKEAWAY: The data free flow agreement may not seem to be relevant to energy issues, but making it a part
of economic security policy may complicate Japan-EU-U.S. ties. The EU and the U.S. have historically been
divided on free data flow principles, notably on privacy, and Japan has tried to act as a bridge. Further, data
flow may become a bigger issue with an expanded use of AI and data centers to complement complex /
decentralized energy systems.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Defense Act amendments pass Diet, onshore wind affected
(Parliament statement, May 10)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  The Act for Establishment of the Ministry of Defense was amended. It will now require
onshore wind operators in designated areas to report and hold consultations with the
govt on possible impact on radio, radar and other defense systems.
o  The consultation period is limited to two years.




Al-Hy-Tec to commercialize power system fueled by aluminum-derived hydrogen
(Nikkei, May 8)
•  Al-Hy-Tec, which is based in the city of Takaoka, plans to commercialize a power generation
system fueled by hydrogen generated from scrap aluminum. The company also plans to enter the

PPA business.
•  320 kWh of power will require 600 tons / year of aluminum. The rates for aluminum-derived
hydrogen power are forecast to be at ¥8 to ¥30 / kWh.
•  CONTEXT: Al-Hy-Tec is a pioneer of hydrogen production that utilizes feed from household scrap
aluminum, dismantled solar panels, etc. The metal emits hydrogen when placed in an alkaline
solution. About 9 kg of aluminum generates 1 kg of hydrogen.
• TAKEAWAY: The ¥8 to ¥30 / kWh range is wide, and suggests that it won’t be as competitive as nuclear

power, seen at ¥7 / kWh. The range also shows a lack of visibility over prices and availability of economical
scrap aluminum, the main material. Scrap aluminum is not waste. Japan generates 1.3 mln tons per year of
scrap aluminum from households and factories, as well as imports, since this amount is not enough to cater
demand from the automotive and housing industries. Establishing strong scrap supply networks and aluminum
price hedging mechanisms are key to make this technology work for the PPA business.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toyota Motor begins hydrogen production from biogas in California
(Company statement, May 2)
o  Toyota Motor North America and FuelCell Energy launched the world's first “Tri-gen”
system that uses biogas to power a 2.3-MW renewables facility that manufactures 1,200

kg/ day of hydrogen.
o  The system was installed at Toyota Logistics Services in Long Beach, California, which is
the company’s largest vehicle processing facility in North America. The electricity will be
for on-site consumption.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Air Water doubles hydrogen supplies in Tokai region

(Company statement, May 7)
o  Air Water has doubled hydrogen supplies in the Tokai region by opening a new 300
Nm3/ hour production plant in the city of Nagoya.
o  Hydrogen with over 99.999% purity will use natural gas as feed.
o  Equipment to load the gas onto trailers was also installed at the plant to supply to large
users. The plant began operations in April.

Kyushu Electric to issue ¥20 billion in transition bonds to boost NPP safety
(Company statement, May 1)
•  Kyushu Electric will issue about ¥20 billion in transition bonds for decarbonization efforts. The
funds will help refinance nuclear power plant safety upgrades.
•  The lead managers will be five companies, including Mizuho Securities and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan

Stanley Securities.
•  CONTEXT: Kyushu Electric operates the Sendai NPP, Units 1 and 2; and Genkai NPP, Units 3 and
4.




KEPCO-led group sets up ¥10 billion fund to develop solar power in Japan
(Company statement, May 1)
•  KX Renewable Energy was launched to invest in solar power projects that utilize PPAs. KEPCO
helped set up the fund, marking its first investment in renewables.
•  The fund will have ¥10 billion at its disposal, and will be managed by KX Renewable Energy, in
partnership with Shiga Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Panasonic Finance, as well as Mitsubishi UFJ

Morgan Stanley Securities and PwC Advisory.
•  CONTEXT: Solar power took off in Japan shortly after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, and by
2017 the country had deployed the world’s second largest solar capacity, only trailing China.
Today, Japan has about 70 GW of installed solar power, contributing about a tenth of the nation’s
electricity. By 2030, Japan aims to build about 108 GW of solar power, and the govt has said the
nation may need much more to meet its decarbonization goals.




Consortium with Hitachi Energy signs €4.5 billion deal to build offshore DC platforms
(Company statement, May 2)
•  Chantiers de l'Atlantique and Hitachi Energy agreed with French transmission operator RTE to
build the offshore DC platforms and onshore converter stations for three wind farms off Normandy

(Centre Manche 1 & 2) and Oléron Island.
•  The deal is estimated at €4.5 billion.
The HVDC transmission systems will
help integrate more than 3.5 GW of
renewable power into the RTE
network.
•  CONTEXT: These offshore wind farms

are more powerful and further from
the coast, where winds are stronger.
To connect these offshore farms to
the onshore grid, it’s necessary to use
DC, which can transport electricity
over very long distances.

MRI estimates offshore wind power potential at 70 GW fixed-bottom, 2.39 TW floating

(Company statement, April 25)
•  The Mitsubishi Research Institute estimated Japan's total offshore wind power potential at 70 GW
of fixed-bottom installations and 2.39 TW of floating installations.
•  At a power generation cost below ¥10/kWh, the MRI calculated that by 2050 about 70 GW of
bottom-fixed wind turbines could possibly be installed. As far as floating wind turbines, it’s
estimated that 1.47 TW of capacity is “highly feasible” at that ¥10/kWh generation cost level.
•  The study took into account data such as wind speed, water depth, as well as navigation and

fishing rights in order to assess the impact on shipping and the fishing industry.
•  CONTEXT: The goal of the research was to identify areas for development, and foster mutual
understanding between offshore wind developers and the fishing industry. Since the study did not
consider all natural and social conditions, the actual potential development area is expected to be
limited.
• TAKEAWAY: As Japan aims to deploy 30 to 45 GW of offshore wind power by 2040, including floating
installations, Japanese firms are keen to lead in the field of floating wind power tech, at least in the APAC

region. Earlier this year, a group of 14 Japanese firms,
along with major utility providers, launched a consortium
to develop mass-production floating wind tech. Japan’s
growing offshore wind market will also offer many
opportunities for overseas wind power developers, and
companies from Northern Europe are busy establishing
partnerships with Japanese firms.

This is possibly the first estimate of floating offshore
wind capacity potential publicized by a private institute
in Japan. MRI’s Mitsubishi connection, and the fact that
Mitsubishi Corp swept the awards of the first round of
offshore wind tenders, is one reason for the positive
outlook in the report. However, it should also resonate

with government energy planners and will likely be taken
into consideration as METI drafts the latest Basic Energy
Plan.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Commercial operation starts at JRE wind farm in Miyagi Pref
(Company statement, May 2)
o  A 42 MW wind farm in Kami town, Miyagi Pref, began commercial operation.
o  It’s run by a JV of ENEOS Renewable Energy and Tohoku Electric.



10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  The farm has 10
Vestas turbines, each
with a 4.2 MW
capacity. The
electricity will be sold

to the Tohoku Electric
Power Network at a
rate of ¥20/ kWh.
o  CONTEXT: The
project was first
launched by JRE
whose shares were acquired by ENEOS in January 2021. JRE and Tohoku Electric began

working on wind power projects in the area in 2020. Tohoku Electric aims to build wind
farms with a total capacity of 2 GW across the six prefs in Tohoku (Aomori, Akita, Iwate,
Yamagata, Miyagi, and Fukushima) as well as in Niigata Pref.



J-Power to suspend or decommission five coal-fired power units

(Company statement, May 9)
•  J-Power will suspend or decommission five domestic coal-fired units across four power plants by
FY2030. A further nine units will be converted to burn a mix of decarbonized fuels with some also
installing IGCC systems and CCS technology.
•  The post-2030 fuel mix will include hydrogen, ammonia, biomass co-firing with CCS, and the use
of coal-derived hydrogen as fuel in IGCC systems with CCS.

•  The power utility also envisions building at least one new unit in the 2030s that will run entirely on
hydrogen or ammonia.
•  CONTEXT: This is the first time that the company has released plans for power plant
decommissioning.
•  By FY2030, J-Power will decommission Units 1 and 2 of the Takasago Thermal Power Plant; and by
late FY2024, Unit 1 of the Matsushima Thermal Power Plant.
•  It will either decommission or suspend Unit 3 of Takehara Thermal Power Plant and Unit 1 of

Matsura Thermal Power Plant. The five plants have 2.7 GW total capacity.
• TAKEAWAY: J-Power was traditionally a wholesale power generator that plugged the gaps in the market and
essentially followed the government energy strategy of the day. In this sense, the firm’s transformation plans
are a reflection of broader state policy to decarbonize the electricity mix, and it’s interesting to see the
portfolio tilt largely to ammonia and hydrogen.
The decommissioned plants represent 30% of J-Power's domestic thermal power capacity. But J-Power’s

vision for the 2030s is not based on a shrinking domestic ‘CO2-free’ generation business – it’s the opposite. In
its medium-term management plan until 2027, the utility plans to invest ¥300 billion over three years. Of that
amount, ¥200 billion will be allocated to renewable energy sources. There will also be more resources put to
the transmission business.

Mitsui to develop 150 MW solar power plant in Texas
(Company statement, May 2)
•  Mitsui & Co will develop a solar power plant (capacity 150 MW) in Hill County in central Texas.
•  Commercial operation is set for 2026, with investment at about ¥30 billion.
•  The power generated will be supplied to the wholesale market and to businesses through Mitsui &

Co. Energy Marketing and Services (MEMS), which handles retail and wholesale sales of electricity
in the U.S.
•  In 2025, MEMS will also operate a storage battery facility in Texas, capacity 300 MWh.
•  CONTEXT: MEMS began trading power in the U.S. market in 2018. In 2021, it started solar power
offtake in West Texas. In 2023, it obtained a license for a retail electric provider, which adopted a
system in which the price of electricity sold to the grid is determined by the location of the power

plant. Hill County is close to heavily populated cities like Dallas where electricity can be sold at a
relatively high price.



Shizen, Majuperak to develop solar power in Malaysia, including floating projects

(Company statement, April 26)

ORIX begins operation of Japan’s largest binary cycle geothermal power plant

(Denki Shimbun, May 1)
•  ORIX began commercial operation of the Minami-Kayabe Geothermal Power Plant by Hakodate
City, Hokkaido.
•  With a 6.5 MW generation capacity, it is Japan’s largest binary cycle geothermal power plant.
•  CONTEXT: Most geothermal power plants in Japan are flash steam power plants that directly use
steam or hot water extracted from underground. Binary cycle power plants can generate electricity
with geothermal resources of lower temperature. It involves vaporizing a working fluid with a

boiling point lower than water, using the heat from underground hot water to turn a turbine to
generate power.

In April, JEPX electricity spot market saw high price volatility on favorable solar power
(Japan NRG, May 10)
•  In April, the electricity spot market on JEPX saw significant price volatility due to positive trends in
solar power generation.

•  There were many days when solar power generation was favorable, pushing daytime prices down.
Only for five days did prices not hit the lower limit of ¥0.01/kWh.
•  Also, prices in April softened for crude oil, but increased for LNG and coal.
•  Prices on JEPX were down from the previous month: the 24-hour average per kWh was ¥9.44; the
daytime average was ¥8.86; the peak average was ¥6.83.
•  The highest price was ¥22.35 on April 3, along the stretch from Kyushu to Tokyo.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Spot market sees contracted volume drop, highest price in upper ¥30 range in March
(Japan NRG, May 10)
o  The JEPX spot market in March saw a 5.5% drop MoM in the average daily contract
volume, falling to 651 GWh. This was because many power sources faced inspections
and repairs, causing a decrease in available supply capacity.
o  Monthly contracted volume increased 1% MoM, to 20.19 TWh.
o  The monthly average price in March was up more than ¥1 over February. The highest

price in March was in the upper ¥30s range.
o  The highest price in the nine areas was ¥36.59, at 6:30 - 7:00 p.m. on March 21.

METI requests Genkai Town to accept survey for nuclear waste final disposal site
(Japan NRG, May 2)
•  Genkai Town council (Saga Pref) accepted a petition for a literature survey on the final disposal site

for high-level radioactive waste. As the town hosts KEPCO’s Genkai NPP, it would be the first
survey in a municipality already hosting an NPP.
•  While the mayor supports the survey, the Pref governor is opposed.
•  CONTEXT: The govt published a map of potential sites. Most of Genkai Town is indicated as
unsuitable, but according to METI the map is not definitive.
• TAKEAWAY: The govt request for a literature survey shows the urgency to support the town's decision-making
process. Yet, there are concerns about local opinion and the burdens of hosting a disposal site. The govt offers

incentives for municipalities, such as subsidies of up to ¥2 billion for a literature survey and up to ¥7 billion for
follow-up surveys.

MODEC  and JGC complete project for quantifying GHG emission from FPSOs
(Company statement, May 2)
•  MODEC and JGC Corp completed a project to measure GHG emissions from floating production,

storage, and offloading systems (FPSOs) in Brazil. This includes methane, nitrous oxide, and
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
•  MODEC aims to become the world's leading FPSO builder and operator.
•  CONTEXT: FPSOs are used in the oil industry to process and store oil until it can be transferred to
a tanker. The equivalent for the natural gas industry is known as a floating liquefied natural gas
(FLNG) facility.
• TAKEAWAY: Measuring GHG emissions from FPSOs is crucial for preventing leakage. Starting 2024, the U.S.

will impose fines of $900 per ton of leaked methane. By 2026, fines will rise to $1,500. Energy companies in
the EU have to install methane leak prevention measures for imported oil and gas.


















Itochu eyes long-term LNG purchases from Canada
(Bloomberg, May 9)
•  Itochu Corp is negotiating a long-term agreement to buy LNG from Canada's proposed Ksi Lisims
project along the northwest coast.
•  This potential deal may span decades. Shell also has a deal with Ksi Lisim.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese trading houses are inking deals for LNG supplies across the globe, eager to

maintain Japan’s strong position in the international market. While a significant portion of the LNG
supplies will help meet Japan’s needs, a sizable amount will be resold to other markets, such as
Southeast Asia, which is boosting its LNG consumption as those countries move away from dirtier
fossil fuels.

Converting CO2 to Cement: Japan Seeks to Decarbonize Hard-to-abate Industries

In April, the Ministry of Environment released its 2022 Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
inventory report to the United Nations, which, in a world first, included CO2 removal
by concrete products. The report said that several innovative concrete variations
demonstrated an ability to absorb CO2. Yet others utilized industrial waste as
feedstock.

The volume of CO2 removed from the atmosphere was small, just 17 tons across four
types of concrete. The impact, however, promises to be orders of magnitude larger as
companies in Japan and elsewhere pursue R&D on a new set of materials that can be
certified as helping to reduce emissions while providing necessary goods.

In a world that puts a price on a ton of CO2, a carbon-negative product could claim
real cost savings. It would also be a major boon for so-called “hard-to-abate sectors”,
such as shipping, and steelmaking, etc, that need to find ways to offset the
environmental costs of operations. Such sectors collectively account for a quarter of
global energy use and a fifth of all emissions. Concrete alone contributes 8% of the
world's total emissions.

While the MoE stresses the need to move away from fossil fuels as the primary means
to achieve net zero, Japan is keenly testing technologies that can absorb CO2 from
the atmosphere. Some of this tech, which is not limited to cement, is developed
overseas thanks to Japanese investments, with the idea that it could later be
‘imported’ and utilized as a key ingredient of Japan’s overall industrial
decarbonization strategy.


We review some of the current initiatives in this field.

Itochu sees opportunities
One of the non-Japanese firms benefiting from interest in decarbonizing cement
production is Australian startup MCi Carbon. Its investors include Itochu, Mizuho Bank
and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. In March 2023, Mizuho Bank invested $5 million in
MCi, with an eye to help commercialize the technology by 2026.

By the end of this year, MCi Carbon plans to complete a new facility in Newcastle,
New South Wales that will utilize the company’s flagship technology, known as
“mineral carbonation”, which converts CO2 into cement. According to estimates, this
process could capture from between 1,000 to 3,000 tons of CO2 a year, producing up
to 10,000 tons of materials with low carbon content.

MCi Carbon’s process is split into three steps. First, in the vicinity of its Newcastle
facility, CO2 will be captured onsite at a chemical company, Orica, which produces
ammonia. (Along with a company called GreenMag Group, Orica founded MCi in
2013.)

Next, the CO2 will react with mineral feedstock gathered from industrial waste.
Specifically, use is made of calcium and magnesium, which are a byproduct of the
steel slag formed during the steelmaking process. The result is the production of
carbonates, which are key ingredients for making cement.


























This mineralization process is spontaneous, which means that it doesn’t need any
external addition of energy. In nature, this happens when CO2 mixes with certain
minerals. The byproduct is the formation of a new mineral, releasing energy. In terms
of chemical notation, the process is: MO (Metal Oxide such as calcium and
magnesium) + CO2→MCO3 (metallic carbonate) + heat.

MCi believes the technology’s key advantage is that captured CO2 does not need to
be of high purity, making it easy for potential customers to integrate the technology.
Furthermore, the mineral feedstock to be reacted with CO2 is not limited to steel slag
but can also come from mine tailings or raw quarried minerals, coal ash from thermal
power plants, etc.

In March 2021, hoping to develop and market the technology in Japan, Itochu inked
an MoU with MCi, confident that the startup is closer to commercializing its
technology than Japanese companies working on such a potential breakthrough.

Among its obligations, Itochu will select sites for an MCi demonstration plant in
Japan, as well as promote products made with the company’s technology. Depending
on the extent of the plant’s success, there may be more developments involving
Itochu in the future.

R&D directions in Japan
Meanwhile, Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development
Organization (NEDO) is advancing a number of different technologies to capture and
utilize CO2 via carbonates and concrete products.

In 2020, five areas related to CO2 recovery R&D were selected. Total funding is
approximately ¥4 billion. One of the five areas is the use of cement-based waste
materials.

Despite state backing, company R&D in this field has been slow to score results.

In 2019, Idemitsu, Ube Industries and JGC Global established a CCSU study group,
aiming to develop technologies to use industrial wastes that are rich in calcium and
magnesium for CO2 capture. The goal was to create carbonates for high-value
applications. The study group’s activities included R&D of elemental technologies,
scale-up, and LCA evaluation.

Furthermore, the group considered exploring potential uses for carbonates and by-
products. Also, research with the Japan Carbon Frontier Organization (JCOAL)
assessed overseas CO2 capture and calcium/magnesium extraction technologies, with
a pilot device technology developed by Columbia University at the Dry Fork coal-fired
power plant in Wyoming.


Four years later, JCOAL told Japan NRG that no specific progress has been made
involving their company. However, after contacting the test center in Wyoming, it
became known that the project is still alive, looking at ways to bind sequestered CO2
with calcium and magnesium in coal fly ash. The methodology will now require field
testing.

In 2020, JFE Steel, Taiheiyo Cement, and the Research Institute of Innovative
Technology for the Earth (RITE) announced work on a similar technology. Specifically,
they're investigating how to extract alkali-earth metals from materials like steel slag
and waste concrete, reacting them with emitted CO2 to produce carbonates.

JFE Steel is also working with RITE and Ehime University to find ways to carbonate
high-temperature steel slag using CO2 emitted by the coal industry, which would lead
to ways to create concrete, cement, carbonates, carbon, and carbides.

Other possible applications
In addition to a rudimentary mimicking of nature, this technology is now evolving into
a way to reuse waste from cement and steelmaking for CO2 capture purposes.

While newly created carbonates will be used to produce cement and steel, the
cement industry is just one possible application. Among others are its inclusion into
the integrated gasification combined cycle, chemical plants, and thermal power
plants.

For example, the Columbia University spinoff, Greenore, extracts calcium from steel
slag and captures CO2. The startup collaborates with TBM in Japan to produce
precipitated calcium carbonate. This is then used to create a line of plastic-like and
paper-line products such as plastic shopping bags, food containers, stationary,
cosmetic bottles and even business cards.

Thanks to their extensive use, carbonates, concrete products and structures show
potential for carbon sequestration through CO2 utilization technologies. The
produced materials from this process are stable.

Unlike CO2 utilization for fuels or chemicals, they don't require hydrogen as a raw
material. Yet, the technology’s widespread adoption would still require significant
capex and strategies to ensure profitability.

Advocates of CCS often say there’s no alternative to CO2 capture for decarbonizing
sectors such as steel, cement, or glass and chemicals. Yet, aside from carbon credits
and other few options, creating value from CCS is currently almost impossible.

Reusing at least part of the sequestered CO2 to create products, such as components
of cement, could possibly lower the cost of adopting carbon capture technologies. In
other words, while adopting CCS would still be a cost item, it could be offset at least
partially by reusing the CO2 through mineralization and turning it into sellable goods.

Energy Jobs in Japan: Building a Local Brand

Anywhere in the world, building an attractive corporate identity and employer brand
is key to attracting top level talent. In Japan, and by no means unique to this market,
is the need to develop a local corporate identity and employer brand. Relying on your
household corporate name in your home market won’t get you very far in Japan.

If the results of the first two rounds of Japan’s fixed-bottom offshore wind tenders
taught us anything, it’s that the Japanese don’t care about your global track record.
The country is not short of well capitalized giants investing in the energy transition,
and it has a strong engineering talent base with some of the largest and most globally
active EPC firms, not to mention a protectionist government.

Considering that more than 90% of the talent pool in the energy market works for
Japanese domestic firms, building a strong brand, highlighting your firm's attractive
points and telling a clear story are key to attracting local talent into your organization.

Communicate a clear vision and commitment to the market
Who are you? What do you do? Why should anyone pay attention? These are the
simplest of questions, but many people in Japan have not heard of many firms that
might be household names in the U.S. or EU markets.


Showing a clear reason for being in Japan, a long-term commitment and goals that
are easy to communicate is also key to gain trust. Culturally, many Japanese have
certain fears of multinational firms, such as a market exit risk or that they might fire
people easily. In a culture that values stability and certainty, these are important
concerns to pre-empt.

Expect to be asked about the time horizon to hit targets, win projects, etc. The vague
“we are here for the long run" no longer holds water since too many who have come
and gone have claimed the same.

Highlight culture, working style and global opportunities
Large Japanese firms tend to be layered and hierarchical, making decisions by
consensus. In some cases, they tie career development to seniority more heavily than
merit. This creates stability and safety, and suits many Japanese professionals. There’s
an increasing number of younger Japanese whose mentality is moving away from the
idea of ‘lifetime employment’ and who wish to take a more active role in their career
development. According to a 2023 study by the Japan Management Association, 36%
of university educated Japanese plan to work for multiple companies throughout their
careers, compared to less than 20% in 2000.

Some of the major positive draw cards for either major foreign firms or Japanese start-
ups / scale-ups are soft touch points. If you have a flat organization structure, flexible
working structure, close interaction with global colleagues, chance to work or be
trained in overseas offices etc, then be sure to highlight and promote these points.

Beyond talent attraction, this can be used to filter the right cultural fit. Describing what
kind of people succeed in the organization, who the business is made of, and what’s
expected of team members can help to allow talent to qualify or disqualify themselves
from your business.

Business introduction > Job description
Job descriptions (JD) are by nature generic. Your project manager likely does work
similar to your competitors, so a list of job duties and requirements don’t do anything
to attract people to your firm. On top of this, they are often filled with internal jargon,
acronyms etc, especially with large firms that advertise internally as well as externally.

Rather than a JD, investing in building a visually appealing slide deck that introduces
your firm will engage talent, and have them understand and be excited about your
business by the time they even reach the JD section. Here are a couple of examples
that have worked well:

European offshore wind developer:
1. ‘About us page’ including information on employees, projects, time in
market, overview of the wider business.
2. APAC presence presented as a map denoting projects and development
phases.
3. Competitive advantages, listing key technical expertise and track record in
floating projects.

4. Culture and workplace, sharing some key benefits offered and notes on
global opportunities.
5. Job description.

Power trading technology firm:
1. Introduction and vision.
2. Raison d'etre.
3. Background and history, demonstrated with figures and timeline.
4. What we are looking for, with cultural descriptions built in.
5. Description of the opportunity - not a job description, but key selling points
of the business around the team, culture, rewards, and impact.
6. Job description.

This approach brings talent along on a journey, builds a personality into your firm, and
will make you stand out among competitors.


Be honest about your capabilities, and what needs to be built
From a survey of more than 5,000 energy industry professionals in Japan, the #1 point
on their wishlist when considering new opportunities was “a role where I can leverage
my skills and experience”. This came above learning new skills, working environment,
salary levels — though of course these will be major decision-making factors!

Considering this, massive value can be secured in communicating where your
organization needs to build capability. By communicating what your team is already
strong in (both locally and globally) you will be able to show that your company has a
strong base of talent to succeed. However, by illustrating where you have gaps, you
allow talent space to find areas where they can come in and add value.
25

This also helps ‘stickability’ - i.e. new employees getting up to speed faster,
onboarding smoothly, and avoiding them leaving or failing fast. Proper management
of expectations is key, and must be done before the person comes into your
organization.

Your corporate name probably won’t hold as much weight in Japan's talent market as
it does at home. Japanese professionals tend to be more cautious about job hunting,
and wish to see more information about a potential employer before considering an
application or even a casual introduction.

Taking the time to craft a story and develop a curated candidate journey allows you to
tap into the top levels of passive talent rather than compete with other companies
over the surface level active talent pool.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Asia / LNG prices
Asian spot LNG prices rose this week on stronger demand amid high temperatures in
China. This pushed EU buyers to bid at narrow discounts to attract sellers. The
average LNG price for June delivery into northeast Asia rose to $10.50 mmBtu, from
$10.40/mmBtu in the previous week.

Australia / Natural gas
The govt unveiled a strategy to boost natural gas development, with an eye to
demand from key Asian partners. Australia is one of the world's largest LNG
exporters. Resources Minister Madeline King said gas would be needed "through to
2050 and beyond".

Australia / Renewable energy
Under the Capacity Investment Scheme, the govt has launched a total of 1.7 GW of
renewable energy tenders in the states of Victoria and Tasmania.

China / Batteries
Taking heed of U.S. and EU complaints about “Chinese overcapacity”, Beijing has
unveiled draft rules that appear aimed at slowing the rapid expansion of its battery
industry. The govt has requested feedback on its proposal, which isn’t yet binding.

China / Hydropower
Erratic rainfall in the southwest is thwarting efforts to green China’s aluminium industry
that accounts for almost 60% of global output. Insufficient hydropower has meant that
only a little over half of the planned aluminium capacity shift has materialized. Some
smelters are scaling back plans and others are seeking alternative locations.

Coal phase out
The G7 agreed to “phase out existing unabated coal power generation in energy
systems during the first half of 2030s”. It’s the first time that a target has been set on
ending coal.

Green steel
Asia's iron ore and steel industry met this past week in Singapore. While virtually every
market player, from iron ore miners to steel mills takes the issue seriously, meeting
net-zero emissions by 2050 in Asia appears unrealistic with current technology.

India / Renewable energy
NTPC Green Energy inked a MoU with MAHAPREIT to develop up to 10 GW of
renewable energy projects in the state of Maharashtra.

Philippines / Nickel
The govt seeks to add three more processing plants to develop a downstream
industry for the country’s abundant nickel resources. China and the U.S. have
expressed interest in the country’s mining sector.

Singapore / Naphtha
In May, Russian exports of naphtha to Singapore are set to rise to their highest level
— as much as 500,000 tons — as Russian refineries recover from drone attacks.

Vietnam / Coal
The country’s coal power phase-out strategy sees renewables accounting for 67.7%–
71.5% of the national energy mix by 2050. Vietnam plans to end coal-power
generation by 2050.
