G7 Climate Ministers to meet April 15-16 in Sapporo
(Japan NRG, Oct. 21)
•  The G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers Meeting will be held April 15-16 (2023) at the
Sapporo Prince Hotel in Hokkaido.
•  METI minister Nishimura said the key agenda is to balance energy security, economic growth and
climate challenges.




New METI group seeks to balance renewable growth and community interests
(Japan NRG, Oct. 17)
•  METI launched a group on balancing renewable capacity growth with community demands to
regulate operators. It's the heir to a joint four-ministry panel that focused on tensions between
operators and local communities.

•  Chaired by Professor Yamauchi Hirotaka of Hitotsubashi University, the panel’s eight other
members are academics, as well as one lawyer and one brokerage firm executive.
•  Four members served on the state panel that disbanded this month.
•  CONTEXT: The previous state panel focused on regulations for forestry development and ways to
spot non-compliance. The new group will address the need to grow renewable capacity while
addressing community concerns.
• TAKEAWAY: Group member Oozeki Takashi of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and

Technology, who also served in the previous panel, cited the need to better train operators. Many are heavily
dependent on engineering contractors and unable to make technology decisions. Increasing the liability of
operators with regulations could defeat plans to expand renewable capacity. So, this is a step taken to help
the industry’s less tech-savvy operators improve.




Ministries submit draft revision of offshore wind public bidding system
(New Energy Business News, Oct. 18)
•  METI and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) have presented a draft
revision of the public bidding system for offshore wind power projects after a period of expert

discussions.
•  The new proposal adds criteria for promptness evaluation, disincentives and penalties for delays,
bidding restrictions, and timing for the announcement of third-party committee members.
•  The criteria will take into account the fastest possible start of operation based on the period of
availability of each base port, while assuming consistency with the energy mix targets for FY2030.
•  The bidding limit is currently set only for offshore Happo Town and Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture;
offshore Oga City, Ligata City, and Akita City, Akita Prefecture; offshore Murakami City and Tainai

City, Niigata Prefecture; and offshore Eshima, Saikai City, Nagasaki Prefecture, which are
scheduled to go to tender during FY2022.
•  In the public auctions for FY2023, if total grid capacity of an area exceeds 1 GW, adding some
form of bidding restrictions will also be considered. The results of FY2022 tenders will be also play
a role in determining the need or otherwise for restrictions.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Ministry working group suggests reviewing offshore wind projects based on port plans
(New Energy Business News, Oct. 17)
o  A working group for offshore wind power jointly run by METI and the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) suggested to rate offshore wind project bids
based on the ports developers plan to use. Officials seeks to avoid overloading ports due

to “overlapping” projects.
o  CONTEXT: When bidding is conducted simultaneously in several nearby offshore wind
promotion areas, there is a possibility that the stated base ports may overlap. For
example, two of the areas in the next round of auctions are located nearby in Akita
Prefecture and would likely require the use of Noshiro Port and Akita Port as base ports.
o  In case of overlap, ministry experts suggested not approving plans for both zones at the
same time. This gives priority to plans that do not overlap.

• TAKEAWAY: The export group suggestions are quite complex and include various conditions. The main goal,
however, seems to be to avoid logistical bottlenecks that would delay nearby projects from keeping to
schedule.



METI minister won’t include LP gas in energy cost relief plan
(Japan NRG, Oct. 21)
•  METI minister NIshimura said that while there are requests to include LP gas in the electricity and
gas price-hike relief plan, LP gas prices rose only 9.7%, which is moderate compared to city gas
and electricity.
•  Nishimura added that LP gas suppliers are small and medium-sized enterprises; and he was

doesn’t want to affect their business.
•  The govt is studying how to reduce power and gas charges for consumers by decreasing fuel
adjustment fees and making the cut visible in bills.
•  CONTEXT: LP gas charges are around 5-10% higher than city gas, resulting in some consumers
shifting to all electric homes. LP gas is primarily used in rural areas that don’t have city gas pipeline
systems.



Japan and Brunei make joint energy transition statement
(Japan NRG, Oct. 17)
•  METI and the Prime Minister’s Office of Brunei said that reducing renewable energy costs and
storage systems, hydrogen, combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) and CCS/CCUS are key
technology areas for decarbonization.

•  Bilateral discussions will formulate energy transition roadmaps in Brunei.

Air Water starts Japan’s first production of Liquified Bio Methane from manure
(Kankyo Business, Oct. 20)
•  Air Water Inc. began production of Liquefied Bio Methane (LBM) derived from livestock manure for
the first time in Japan. On October 13, the first shipment was made from the Center Plant in

Obihiro City, Hokkaido, which processes biogas into LBM, to the Tokachi Main Plant of Yotsuba
Dairy in Sapporo City.
•  The Tokachi facility will conduct a demonstration test of using LBM as an alternative fuel to
liquefied natural gas (LNG), and work to establish a series of supply chain models.
•  If all of the approximately 360 tons of LBM produced annually at the Center Plant were used
instead of LNG, CO2 emission reduction would run to 7,740 tons per year, and the GHG reduction
rate would be more than 60%.

New regulation for next-generation reactors in the works

(Denki Shimbun, Oct. 20)
•  NRA Chairman Yamanaka said new regulation for next-gen reactors will be ready within a year or
two. This refers tor new reactors based on APWR / ABWR technology.
•  However it will take much longer to do the same for SMRs and other reactor technologies.


7


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: Yamanaka’s statement backs up METI policy. Last month, GH Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries disclosed their next-gen reactors, both based on ABWR / APWR. The relatively quicker and easier
path to bringing online reactors based on the tried and tested ABWR and APWR indicates that Japan’s
appetite for other technologies is actually small. For all the talk about SMRs in and outside the country, as well
as Japan’s vaunted high-temperature gas-cooled technology, the leadership seems more interested in getting

capacity online than making breakthroughs.

Quitting Russian Coal:
Japan Struggles to Make Good on its Promise

Six months ago, Prime Minister Kishida vowed that Japan would ban Russian coal
imports, aligning the nation with G7 allies in sanctions over the war in Ukraine.
Actually following through with the order, however, is proving complicated.

Japan’s purchases of Russian coal are down almost 40% since April. While imports fell
significantly in the months after Kishida’s statement, volumes increased in summer. By
August, Russian coal imports recovered to more than two-thirds of the level a year
earlier.

As western allies seek to disengage from Russian energy, the realities of doing so are
hitting hard. The global coal market is in an extreme flux. Prices have jumped to
unbelievable records, and that hasn’t even dampened demand as nations including
Japan look to coal to guarantee power and heating this winter amid natural gas
shortages.

While Russia boosts energy sales to China and India, though at discounted prices, the
leverage of G7 allies is diminishing. Japanese utilities have certainly engaged with
providers elsewhere to potentially replace Russian coal volumes, but logistics and coal
grades are not easily interchangeable.
So, can Japan make good on Kishida’s pledge?


Devil in the details
When Kishida promised that Japan will phase out Russian coal imports he omitted
one crucial detail: Timing. There’s no deadline, allowing Japanese buyers to work out
a solution with exporters from Australia, Indonesia and Canada, etc, on their own
schedule.

Another thing that will be difficult to replace is geography. Russian coal can reach
Japan within three days. The longer routes from Southeast Asia or North America, as
well as elevated oil and freight prices, will raise the total cost of energy.

Currently, Japan is the world's third-largest coal importer, and about 60% of its total is
thermal coal used to generate electricity at power plants, in the cement industry, and
as fuel for boilers. The rest is coking coal used to make steel.

In 2021, Russia supplied 12% of Japan's total thermal coal imports (13.88 million tons),
making it the second largest provider after Australia (81.67 million tons, 73% of the
total). Russia also supplied 8% of Japan's coking coal imports (5.85 million tons), the
third most, trailing only Australia (37.78 million tons, 54%) and Indonesia (12.62 million
tons, 18%).

Russian imports fell significantly in May and June this year, compared with month-
earlier and year-earlier figures. But they revived after that. In the five months of data
available since April, total coal imports from Russia decreased 38%.

Japan imports far more thermal coal from Russia than the fuel for steelmaking. Thus,
Russian imports are a factor in the domestic power price, though smaller than that
played by LNG.

Data shows a much heavier drop in Japanese imports of Russian coking coal than for
its thermal cousin. In April through August, coking coal imports dropped 62% YoY.
Instead, Japan has relied on more supply from Indonesia and Canada. Australian
coking coal volumes remained steady on a YoY basis.

For thermal coal, the story is different. Russian volumes are down just 31%, YoY. The
buying dropped precipitously in late spring, but rebounded in late summer, indicating
the fewer options available to Japan and the fact that much overseas volume is based
on long-term contracts.

Price is one more reason why Japanese utilities failed to diversify significantly from
Russian suppliers. Coal reached nearly $400/ ton in August (up 260%, YoY), rising to
around $430/ ton in September. Japan spent about ¥609.97 billion on coal imports in
May (up 276%, YoY), which ballooned to ¥876.12 billion (up 241%, YoY) in August.


Industries hit hard
Japan’s imports from Russia are mainly of low-ash, high-calorific value coal. That’s not
easy to replace for sectors that require a certain coal quality and grade and that can’t
afford to pay any price to secure the material. One example is the construction
industry, which is already hurting from a broader surge in raw material costs.

Another sector struggling to adapt is cement manufacturing. About half of the coal
used in Japan’s cement industry, where thermal coal heats the limestone, is of Russian
origin. This is the case for Taiheiyo Cement and Sumitomo Osaka Cement.

With coal prices above $400/ ton and transportation costs high, prices of ready-mixed
concrete surged in July 2022, reaching a record ¥16,000/ m3 in the Tokyo area. UBE-
Mitsubishi Cement raised its prices by ¥3,000/ ton from October. Taiheiyo Cement
adopted a new strategy, using a surcharge that reflects fluctuations in the cost of coal.

Coal bidding wars?
The closest alternatives to Russian coking coal in the Asia-Pacific region are in
Australia. In July, Australian mining giant Glencore signed an all-time high deal with
Nippon Steel ($375/ ton FOB through March 2023), and in October it made an even
more lucrative deal with Tohoku Electric ($395/ ton FOB for Oct 2022-Sept 2023).
Such contracts are almost triple 2021 levels, reported Sxcoal.

The contracts between Australia's Glencore and Japanese companies could be
considered as the benchmark for East Asia.
Some analysts expect that China’s and India’s increased purchases of Russian coal will
keep prices robust. But while their purchases rose dramatically from February to July,
they fell in August, indicating that a plateau in their appetite has been reached.

As for Japan, the coming winter will be a major challenge. Forecasts suggest that
temperatures will be below average, forcing Japan to buy large quantities of LNG and
high-energy coal. Japan will have to directly compete with countries ranging from
South Korea to the EU, possibly leading to a bidding war similar to the one in the LNG
market.


Limit on economic pressure
That situation would support the currently elevated power prices in Japan at least until
the end of the winter demand peak, continuing to exert inflationary pressure on the
rest of the economy. With the likely future rise in coal prices (and, consequently, the
cost of other materials like steel and cement), the cost of new construction – including
new power generation facilities – will rise.

Japan’s ability to exert further economic pressure on Russia through a reduction in its
energy imports seems to be reaching its limit. Imports of Russian oil are already down
to 1% of total. Part-subsidizing Japanese gasoline prices has cost the government an
estimated ¥3.2 trillion this year.

Japan’s commitment to Russian natural gas has survived President Putin’s abrupt
restructuring of the Sakhalin-2 LNG project in which Mitsubishi and Mitsui trading
houses sit as investors. If Japan is unable to further replace Russian thermal coal with

alternative suppliers or other forms of power, the scope for further pressure remains
narrow. In fact, there may be a temptation to pause or even relax energy sanctions
against Russia.

In the immediate future, Kishida’s government faces the need to support vulnerable
sectors of the population and economic sectors to ward off energy poverty and a
slump in the construction industry, among others.

The complex intertwining of strategic geopolitical decisions between Japan and its
western partners, and the need to show solidarity on Ukraine, means Kishida will stay
the course promoted by Washington. But should the war escalate, and the U.S. call on
further action against Moscow, Tokyo’s ability to deliver substance and not just
rhetoric will be limited.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF):
Stuck on the Runway, Waiting for Takeoff in Japan

Aviation accounts for over 2% of mankind’s emissions, more than other transportation
systems such as trains or sea vessels. As such it has become key to the international
effort to decarbonize transport, and Japan has eagerly embarked on a strategy to
clean up its air travel by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SAF is a green replacement for traditional kerosene-based jet fuel, and it’s made from
sources such as sugarcane in Brazil, waste gas in China and corn in the U.S. According
to BloombergNEF, U.S. demand for SAF will grow by 12.1 billion liters each year
through 2030.

In Japan, SAF production is still in its infancy. Several manufacturers and trading firms
are eager to get into the sector, seeing strong demand from Japanese airlines. ANA
Holdings and Japan Airlines, the nation’s top two players, both set targets to employ
SAF to meet 10% of their fuel needs by 2030.

The pace of progress, however, remains slow. After three years of pandemic-hit
business, airlines are wary of passing on the higher costs that come with SAF. The key
to bringing those costs down may lie with strategic government support.


State support for SAF
The International Civil Aviation Organization has set two goals for the sector: carbon
neutral growth from 2020 onwards, and 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement
through 2050. Also, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) approved a
resolution to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Implementation of these goals in Japan is led by the government but in close
cooperation with the private sector. Three state entities are charged with
implementing policies on aviation fuel – METI, the MoE, and the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).

On Sept 1, the MLIT issued a roadmap for the decarbonization of aviation fuel,
reiterating the government target set in December 2021 to replace 10% of
conventional aviation fuel with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030.

Should that come to pass, Japanese airports could need between 2.5 billion liters and
5.6 billion liters of SAF by 2030.

The MoE is more concerned with streamlining the SAF supply chain, such as raw
material procurement; and ethanol production from glycation and gasification /
fermentation of waste. The MoE is financing research to identify challenges for
practical usage of SAF, as well as a small plant to ferment combustible waste into
ethanol, for production of SAF and plastic.

Connecting public policy with private action is NEDO, the state research hub. In April,
NEDO awarded ¥114 billion ($916 million) in grants for SAF and other green fuels. Of
that, Idemitsu Kosan received ¥29.2 billion for a five-year project to develop a SAF
supply chain using alcohol-to-jet technology.

Idemitsu’s goal is to convert 180 million liters of ethanol into 100 million liters of SAF;
that facility is expected to begin operations in 2026. A second facility will be online by
2030, boosting SAF production to 500 million liters per year.

On Sept 14, NEDO opened a center on Ohsaki-Kamijima Island, Hiroshima Prefecture
to research Carbon Capture and Storage, but it also seeks to develop SAF made from
algae. On Oct 5, METI held the Japan-U.S. Ethanol Workshop, which primarily
discussed use of alternative fuels in automobiles, and pledged to back the usage of
bioethanol for SAF.


Private sector initiatives
Some Japanese SAF initiatives have involved Finland’s Neste, the world’s leading SAF
supplier. In October 2020, Neste teamed up with trading house Itochu to set up a
supply chain for the green fuel in Japan. This partnership facilitated Neste’s first SAF
Asian delivery. The two now supply domestic and international airlines with SAF at
Haneda and Narita airports.

This past May, Itochu announced a sales contract with Neste SAF to supply Etihad
Airways in the United Arab Emirates. This month, Itochu and Neste said they’ll supply
SAF to Chubu Centrair International Airport (Aichi Prefecture) and Kansai International
Airport (Osaka) until at least the first half of 2023.

The emerging SAF sector is also drawing in Japan’s engineering and oil refining
majors. In March, heavy machinery maker IHI Corp signed a MoU with Singapore’s
A*STAR’s Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment (ISCE) to
launch a Joint Centre for Research and Development. The goal is to accelerate carbon
solution projects, including SAF.

In April, ENEOS and TotalEnergies announced a study to assess SAF production at
ENEOS's Negishi refinery in Yokohama, which, if approved, might begin production in
2025.

In July, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries signed a MOU with Boeing to establish an R&D
facility in Japan to develop SAF and advance electric and hydrogen aircraft
technology. The two will study new feedstocks for SAF production, including green
hydrogen. Boeing is committed to flying its planes on 100% SAF by 2030.

Engineering firm JGC Holdings and petroleum wholesaler Cosmo Oil plan to work
with waste plastics or biomass such as algae and wood chips to create a locally made
commercial SAF product by 2025, with manufacturing expected to take place in
Osaka.

Finally, in September, algae-fuels specialist Euglena scored a first when it supplied
domestically produced SAF to a facility at Narita Airport. Euglena refueled using
"SUSTEO", which is made of edible oil and Euglena oil extracted from microalgae.

International cooperation
The difficulty in sourcing raw materials for SAF and strong R&D in the field in the U.S.
has led Japanese firms also to partner with American companies.

LanzaJet, a startup backed by Bill Gates’ climate-focused Breakthrough Energy
Ventures, counts Mitsui & Co. as a shareholder. The startup is building its first SAF
plant in the state of Georgia, which expects to begin production next year, doubling
total annual Amercian SAF capacity to 34 million liters. A future SAF facility with
LanzaJet technology in Japan has also been discussed by Mitsui.

According to LanzaJet, its SAF emits 85% less pollutant than current aviation fuel.
That ability to significantly reduce CO2 is drawing in sizable investment. With patrons
such as Gates on board, LanzaJet secured a cheap loan worth $50 million from the
Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund (which includes the BlackRock Foundation) and $14
million from the U.S. Department of Energy. About $200 million to build the plant will
come from shareholders, such as Mitsui & Co., British Airways and Shell.


Green premium
With plenty of projects on the horizon and government support across multiple
ministries, SAF should develop briskly. And yet, meeting even the 10% ratio goal by
2030 will be difficult without further reduction in SAF manufacturing costs.

This is far from a Japan problem. As Gates wrote in his notes last week, this is an issue
faced by the industry in general. “I call the difference in price between current
technology and the clean alternative the ‘Green Premium’... and it needs to be near,
at, or below zero” [to get companies on board].

Air travel in 2022 is already at price levels well above those experienced by consumers
in recent years, so passing on the costs of SAF will prove problematic. As such,
Japanese airlines are trying to gauge interest for “CO2-neutral” flying from
corporates, whose fares might subsidize SAF use.

Beyond that, state subsidies will be required to support a broader SAF rollout. That
move may be unpopular. After all, not everyone flies. But after years of subsidizing
fossil fuels, the government could argue that it’s time to switch those subsidies to low-
carbon alternatives.

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Battery storage
The government will support two transmission projects to interconnect regional grids
and increase use of renewable energy. “Rewiring the Nation” is a AU$20 billion
initiative to modernize the electric grid. In related news, Akaysha Energy, owned by
BlackRock, was awarded the 1.4 GWh ‘Super Battery’ contract in New South Wales.

Ecuador/ Oil spill
The operator of the OCP oil pipeline said that damage by vandals caused a spill in the
country's Amazon region. The company said it "managed to control the incident and
begin cleanup operations," but did not specify how much crude had spilled. The OCP
pipeline can carry up to 450,000 barrels/ day.

Germany/ Nuclear power
Chancellor Olaf Scholz decreed that all three of the country’s remaining nuclear power
plants will continue operating to April 2023. Berlin had planned to shut down the
three NPPs by Dec 31.

Italy/ Qatar/ Natural gas
Oilfield contractor Saipem signed a $4.5 billion contract with Qatargas. This is
the company’s largest offshore contract ever. The deal services the North Field
Production Sustainability Offshore Complexes Project in Qatar’s northeast coast.

Norway/ EVs
By the end of 2023, Oslo will become the first capital city with an all-electric public
transport system, as part of its goal to become the world's first emissions-free city by
2030. The plan calls for diesel buses to be replaced by 450 electric ones.

Qatar/ Natural gas
Energy Minister Saad al-Kaabi warned that while this winter Europe will have sufficient
natural gas for power and heating, next winter will be “much worse”, as reserves will
be depleted, adding that the energy crisis could last to 2025.

Russia/ Oil dispute
ExxonMobil accused the Kremlin of “expropriation” of its largest oilfield in the
country, claiming that its stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project was “unilaterally
terminated” and that the field was transferred to a domestic operator.

U.S./ Oil production
Shale billionaire Harold Hamm will take total control of Continental Resources, valuing
its equity at about $27 billion. Hamm said this will give the company freedom to
explore for more oil and “to help secure America’s energy independence”.

U.S./ Biogas
BP will acquire Houston-based biogas producer Archaea Energy that processes
organic waste from landfill sites and the farming industry to make gas. The $4 billion
deal will increase BP’s biogas supply by 50% and provide a pipeline of more than 80
projects that could quintuple volume by 2030.

UK/ North Sea oil and gas
The North Sea Transition Authority will award more than 100 oil and gas licences,
covering 900 locations for exploration. Greenpeace called the decision “possibly
unlawful” and will consider taking legal action.

Ukraine/ Nuclear power
Heavy fighting was reported at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in Energodar.
Russian troops occupy the city, and Ukrainian forces directly across the Dnipro River
are trying to retake it. The 5.7 GW plant is Europe’s largest and in the world’s top 10.
