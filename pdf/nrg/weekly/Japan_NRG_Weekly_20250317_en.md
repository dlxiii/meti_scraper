NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


Japan to establish monitoring guidelines for offshore wind environmental impact

(Government statement, March 14)
•  Japan’s govt launched a study group to develop monitoring guidelines for offshore wind projects,
enhancing environmental impact assessments.
•  The goal is to gather scientific data during construction and operation to optimize environmental
protection measures and reduce the sector’s overall impact.
•  The study group, composed of experts in environmental assessments, will review global trends and
scientific findings, define the roles of the government and businesses, and draft guidelines.
•  CONTEXT: The decision comes amid growing concerns in the industry over profitability of projects
under the existing subsidy and bidding schemes, which caused the Mitsubishi Corp-led consortium
awarded in Round 1 to reassess its ability to continue developing its three large-scale projects.
• TAKEAWAY: Environmental impact assessments take up about half the time of the entire offshore wind project,
according to research conducted in a special report by Japan NRG late last year. The time and resources
involved make the assessments a major cost item for the developers. What’s more, the environmental impact
data developers currently receive from the government is insufficient, often necessitating additional work.
Therefore, this latest effort by the govt to review the current setup and improve it should be seen as a positive
step. It may come too late to help developers resolve issues with ongoing projects, but it should help to
influence the direction of future offshore wind developments.



Govt approves bill to amend the EIA process
(Government statement, March 11)
•  The govt approved a bill to amend the Environmental Impact Assessment Act that will streamline
procedures for redevelopment projects. The Act also calls for the MoE to ensure continuous access
to EIA public documents.
•  The amendment exempts certain surveys for redevelopment projects where existing facilities are
replaced with similar ones in the same or nearby location. Instead, it will require businesses to

disclose environmental considerations for the new structures based on the impact of the existing
project.
•  This change is expected to apply to wind farms undergoing renewal after reaching their lifespan.
•  Additionally, the bill allows EIA documents, such as scoping and assessment reports, to remain
accessible online even after the public viewing period.
•  CONTEXT: More than 25 years since its enactment, many infrastructure projects subject to EIA
procedures now face redevelopment, but the law lacks provisions for projects where location and scale
remain largely unchanged, treating them the same as entirely new projects.



FEPC chairman urges govt to be flexible on coal-power plants shutdown
(Nikkei, March 14)
•  Hayashi Shingo, chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPC) said he supports
the govt's policy to shut down inefficient coal-fired power plants by 2030. Still, he opposes a
uniform reduction with a fixed deadline.
•  He urges a flexible approach that considers the intentions of power companies and the need for a
stable power supply.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  He also called for caution when decommissioning high-efficiency power plants. He requested the
govt to consider compensation for lost profits.
• TAKEAWAY: The shutdown of coal power plants in Japan has faced ongoing utility and industry pushback ever
since the first version of a government strategy to do so appeared in the summer of 2020. At the time, METI
was gearing up to phase out over 100 ‘inefficient’ coal-fired units. The ministry categorized 110 out of the 140
units in the country as ‘inefficient’ based on their energy efficiency. No sooner were those plans floated than
debates broke out over what should be deemed ‘inefficient.’ The plans soon became bogged down and remain
uncertain to this day.



Toshiba ESS, Chubu Electric ink deal on large-scale rock thermal energy system
(Company statement, March 12)
•  Toshiba ESS, Chubu Electric, and Okazaki City, Aichi Pref, agreed to introduce the largest plant in
Japan using rock thermal storage and energy management technology.
•  By late FY2026, they’ll conduct a feasibility study (FS) of equipment, including the optimal thermal
capacity and installation site, based on actual data of electricity and heat demand in Okazaki City.
•  Toshiba will be responsible for overall coordination, general equipment specifications, and
operational simulations. Chubu Electric will provide power system data. Okazaki City will verify

and provide actual energy data.
•  Based on the FS results, Toshiba and Chubu Electric plan to begin manufacturing the units in
FY2027; thermal capacity is expected to be in the tens of MWh.
•  Okazaki City plans to deploy a rock thermal energy storage system by FY2029 to supply heat and
electricity to residences, public facilities, and businesses in the city.
•  CONTEXT: In FY2022, Toshiba ESS and Chubu Electric developed a rock thermal energy storage test
facility of about 500 kWh. In FY2026, they plan to conduct a test of about 10 MWh in cooperation
with Shin-Tokai Paper and Shimada City, Shizuoka.
• TAKEAWAY: Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) is attracting attention as a means of eliminating renewable
energy supply instability and responding flexibly to changes in power demand. Energy storage today is
dominated by batteries and mechanical pumped storage, but thermal storage could also become an important
tech, and its deployment is progressing.



Cabinet approves bill to clamp down on copper cable theft
(NHK, other reports, March 11)
•  The Cabinet approved a bill to curb the sale of stolen copper cables and valuable metals,
particularly from solar farms. Copper theft has been driven by high metals prices.
•  The bill compels scrap metal dealers to verify sellers’ identities, workplace, and addresses, and
requires businesses buying copper scrap to register with the state. Violators will face up to six
months in prison, or ¥1 million in fines, or both.
•  The bill now heads to the Diet and is expected to take effect within a year.
•  CONTEXT: According to the National Police Agency, metal theft incidents have risen from 5,478 in
2020 to 20,701 in 2024. Solar farms have been prime targets. In 2024 alone, 7,054 cases of cable theft
from such facilities were reported.

NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


TOCOM's electricity futures trading surged in Feb, posted record in March

(Exchange statement, March 13)
•  The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) said that on March 13 it set a record-high daily trading
volume of 711 GWh, surpassing the previous record set on Nov 7, 2024 (153 GWh).
•  This came on the back of a strong February performance. Driven by larger trades in both day and
night sessions, TOCOM’s power futures trading volume rose to 3,085 contracts in February, more
than doubling from 1,303 contracts in January.
•  Demand for FY2025 annual contracts (April 2025 – March 2026) and winter contracts (Dec 2025 –
Feb 2026) increased, with some market participants citing a lack of alternative futures products for
winter hedging.
•  Weekly contracts saw growth, especially in Western Japan, where volatility was higher due to
fluctuating solar power generation and temperature-sensitive price movements in JEPX's spot
market.
•  Large trades exceeded 100 contracts in multiple sessions, including a 500-contract deal for
February 2026 at ¥16/ kWh and a total of 700 contracts for the same month traded between
¥15.90 – 16.10/ kWh.
•  CONTEXT: West Japan is the main driver of power trading volumes this year. Volumes on the TOCOM
rose 60.3% in January to 90.7 GWh. West Japan baseload contracts grew 66.2%, surpassing East
Japan baseload for a second consecutive month. On Jan 20, a major deal was struck in response to a
sharp decline in spot market prices, contributing to 60% of the month’s West Japan baseload volume.
• TAKEAWAY: Power trading in Japan is not only winning volumes but also interest from traditional utilities.
About 70% of trades occurring on the TOCOM are now directly posted on the exchange, rather than off-market
deals. And while it’s true that the majority of the volumes are concentrated in about 15-20 players, interest
outside of Japan is growing. Perhaps one of the biggest bottlenecks to market growth today may not even be on
the financial or technical side – it’s the shortage of traders to execute.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TOCOM to launch annual electricity futures contracts in May
(Denki Shimbun, March 10)
o  TOCOM will introduce annual electricity futures contracts on May 26, allowing market
participants to fix prices for one year. The new contracts cover four categories: baseload

and daytime load in both the eastern and western Japan markets.
o  A "cascading" mechanism will be introduced, automatically converting unsettled annual
contracts into monthly contracts by the fiscal year-end, reducing margin requirements and
increasing liquidity in monthly contracts.
o  Annual contracts will be tradable up to two years in advance, addressing strong market
demand for long-term price hedging, especially from renewable energy producers and
retailers.
o  CONTEXT: A full-scale adoption of the contracts is expected in autumn 2025.



EEX sets record for daily and weekly power futures trading
(Company statement, March 10)
•  EEX, the power trading marketplace, set a record for daily volume, with 2.8 TWh of contracts
processed in one day.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  It also set a record for volume traded in one week – 6.1 TWh of electricity derivatives in the first
week of March. EEX expects growth to continue thanks to new monthly options contracts and an
upcoming orderbook trading facility feature.
•  CONTEXT: EEX has succeeded in capturing over 95% of all electricity derivatives trading in Japan since
entering the market five years ago. Other exchanges that offer Japanese power futures include TOCOM
and ICE.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Intraday electricity market sees slight increase, peak price hitting ¥60
(Denki Shimbun, March 11)
o  The JEPX intraday market saw a 0.6% increase MoM in average daily trading volume to
16.6 GWh, marking the second consecutive monthly rise. Trading surged in early January
due to severe cold, with daily volumes exceeding 30 GWh on two days.
o  Total monthly trading volume reached 514 GWh, up 0.6% from December, while the
number of trades fell 6.7% to 218,083. The market accounted for 0.6% of Japan's total
electricity demand.
o  The highest price was ¥60/ kWh on Jan 30, exceeding surrounding periods by nearly ¥50.
The lowest price of ¥0.01/ kWh was recorded in 91 settlement periods.



OCCTO  awards 93 MW in solar power auction with average bid at ¥5
(Government statement, March 7)
•  Japan awarded 93 MW of solar power capacity to five successful bidders in its 23rd auction. This
was the 4th round for FY2024, which ends this month.
•  The highest capacity, 29.91 MW, was awarded to hep SPV 16 Japan (a unit of hep solar, a

developer operating in Germany and Japan), for a price set at ¥5. It secured the same capacity at
the same price in March 2024. It was followed by Manago Taiyoko, which secured 29.9 MW at
¥4.47.
•  The weighted average bid price was ¥5.06/ kWh, with individual bids ranging from ¥4.47/ kWh to

Kyushu Electric Group expands offshore transmission in UK
(Company statement, March 10)
•  Kyushu Electric International and Kyushu Electric Power T&D signed an asset transfer and financing
agreement for subsea transmission of the Seagreen Phase 1 Offshore Wind Farm. Power will be sent
to mainland UK.
•  The project, 27 km off the east coast of Scotland, with a transmission capacity of 1.08 GW, is
managed through an SPC established with UK infrastructure fund Equitix.
•  CONTEXT: The firms are part of Kyushu Electric Group. The project is financed through a £568 million
syndicated loan, arranged by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Mizuho Bank,
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, and Aviva Life & Pensions UK.



TEPCO’s financial struggles and new reconstruction plan

(Nikkei, March 13)
•  TEPCO is preparing a new reconstruction plan to improve its financial balance by ¥100 billion
through asset sales and investment reductions. This move comes as delays in restarting the
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP raise concerns.
•  The utility could have a potential cash shortage within the next 1-2 years. TEPCO is seeking support
from the state and banks to maintain financial stability, negotiating for loan repayment extensions
and new credit lines.
•  TEPCO faces ¥2.6 trillion in short-term debt maturing by the end 2024. If no nuclear reactors
restart by FY2025, cash reserves could fall below the ¥300 billion level needed for stable
operations.
•  TEPCO postponed the release of its new plan to summer 2025 due to uncertainties around nuclear
restarts.
•  CONTEXT: The company’s cash flow has been negative for six consecutive fiscal years, despite ¥1.6
trillion in cumulative net profit over the past decade.
• TAKEAWAY: While financial institutions question TEPCO’s ability to execute reforms, the company is in no
shape to operate as a ‘normal’ business. It remains state-controlled in terms of equity and strategy, but the
government cannot help TEPCO resolve one of its biggest issues – restarting its remaining operable NPP. There
is no financial institution that sees lending to TEPCO as a business proposition. A ¥400 billion emergency loan
in 2023 remains unpaid. Which means, TEPCO remains in limbo, a ‘zombie’ company despite its numerous
viable businesses. The group needs a real restructuring. Should private banks balk at further loans, as expected,
METI will need to embark on a restructuring process within FY2025.



Osaka Gas, CleanMax to help Indian clients with energy transition

(Company statement, March 10)
•  Osaka Gas formed a JV with India-based Clean Max Enviro Energy Solutions, a leading Asian
renewables provider.
•  The JV will be called Clean Max Osaka Gas Renewable Energy (CORE), and it will acquire a portion
of CleanMax's renewables assets and develop new ones. By 2028, CORE is expected to own a total
of 400 MW of renewables assets.
•  CONTEXT: With this partnership, Osaka Gas is entering the clean energy market in India. The JV was
formed by the gas company’s subsidiary, Osaka Gas Singapore, and the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation (JBIC).
•  CONTEXT: The govt of India, anticipating a substantial long-term increase in electricity demand due to
economic growth, set a goal to introduce 500 GW of renewables by 2030.

NEWS:    HYDROGEN



Govt announces tender to support nationwide hydrogen hubs
(Government statement, March 5)
•  METI announced a tender to build infrastructure at sites around Japan that would like to become
hydrogen hubs. Facilities must serve multiple end users of hydrogen or related fuels, such as
ammonia. Applications close June 30, 2025.
•  CONTEXT: This is part of the govt’s program to establish three hubs near major cities, and five regional
sites that would have the infrastructure to import and distribute hydrogen and related fuels in Japan.
The availability of such infrastructure is vital to building business demand for the clean-burning fuels.
•  CONTEXT: JOGMEC is now reviewing various hub proposals from around the country. More than
eight groups/ consortia are interested in creating such hubs in Japan, but METI is keen to initially limit
the support to eight sites.
•  In the first, FY2025 round, only support for FEED (Front End Engineering Design) will be
distributed with a focus on low carbon fuel transportation or storage facilities. The projects that win
must complete the FEED by March 2026.
• TAKEAWAY: Infrastructure development is one of the biggest challenges to creating a hydrogen society. So, it’s
surprising this support scheme was rolled out without announcing a total budget, as was the case in the
ongoing Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme to support hydrogen end-users. Further details are expected
later. There was speculation last year that METI’s infrastructure support would be about ¥1 trillion.




Tokyo Govt selects three projects for new energy tech support program
(Government statement, March 10)
•  Tokyo Govt and Tokyo Environmental Public Service Corp decided on three projects for the FY2024

o  1) “Demo project for new high-pressure hydrogen gas distribution methods and expanded
use for hydrogen energy conversion” by Suntory Holdings, in collaboration with Tomoe
Shokai, Samtech, and Nippon Trex.
o  2) “Demo project for exchangeable battery EV” by Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus, in
collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors, Aqua, Ample, etc.
o  3) “Development of new biofuel (HVO) blended fuel and supply chain construction, and
social implementation” by Euglena, in collaboration with Tokyu Bus, Shimizu, Takenaka,
Asahi Kosan, Isuzu Motors, Kamei, etc.
•  The support is mainly for large companies with headquarters or branches in Tokyo, and the period
is up to three years, with a maximum of ¥3 billion per group; the subsidy is up to two-thirds of
eligible expenses.
•  CONTEXT: Tokyo Govt is working toward the realization of "Zero Emission Tokyo," with the goal of
halving carbon emissions by 2030.

U.S. hydrogen market slowdown poses challenges for Japan
(Nikkei, March 14)
•  Enthusiasm for hydrogen energy in the U.S. is cooling, with Japanese and American companies
delaying or withdrawing from hydrogen projects due to policy shifts under the Trump
administration and rising costs caused by inflation.
•  INPEX postponed a Houston-based ammonia project by at least a year, citing uncertainty about U.S.
decarbonization policies and a preference for natural gas.
•  Major industrial gas company Air Products will withdraw from three hydrogen projects in New York
State, reflecting a decline in investment confidence.
•  CONTEXT: The U.S. shift in energy policy threatens Japan’s hydrogen strategy since the country’s
utilities have banked on ammonia imports as a pathway to reduce CO2 emissions at coal-fired power
plants.

• TAKEAWAY: With U.S. hydrogen and ammonia projects facing setbacks – and most importantly uncertainty
about their cost structures due to the freezing of IRA and other subsidies – Japanese companies may turn to
alternative suppliers, such as in the Middle East and Australia.



MHIET achieves rated output with 500 kW-class hydrogen engine
(Company statement, March 12)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Engine & Turbocharger (MHIET) achieved a rated output with a six-
cylinder 500 kW-class hydrogen engine power generation system.
•  The system was verified, including newly made hydrogen-only reciprocating engines, generators
and auxiliary equipment with additional safety features.
•  By establishing an integrated development cycle for hydrogen-only engines within its own factory,
MHIET says it can commercialize the product in FY2026.
•  CONTEXT: MHI Group is working on the development and practical application of hydrogen engines
based on conventional diesel and gas engines. Projects include:
o  In August 2021, in cooperation with Toho Gas, testing of a gas engine (450 kW) with a
hydrogen co-firing rate of 35%.
o  In November 2023, a single-cylinder gas engine (5.75 MW) to generate power and stable
combustion with a hydrogen co-firing of up to 50%.

(Financial Times, March 13)
•  SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund 2 led a $130 million round for California-based Terabase Energy,
which uses AI and robotics to automate solar farm construction.
•  This assembly line was piloted at three U.S. solar farms (40 MW in total capacity), with two more
projects underway and plans to scale to hundreds of MWs by 2026.
•  The 50-meter-long mobile factory can install 2,000 solar panels in eight hours, and claims to reduce
costs, boost efficiency, and address labour shortages.
•  CONTEXT: Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy was an early backer of the startup that has raised $200

Hirosaki Uni develops lithium recovery method; seeks practical use with Toyota, etc
(Nikkei, March 11)
•  Hirosaki University developed technology to efficiently recover lithium from used batteries and is
testing the method with companies like Toyota Motor.
•  This could reduce recovery costs to about one-tenth of those when extracting lithium from ore. The
goal is to achieve practical application in the next few years.
•  The process involves heating and crushing the batteries, dissolving the material in sulfuric acid, and
applying voltage to facilitate the migration of lithium ions through the membrane. This method
allows for the extraction of lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate with nearly 100% purity.
•  The operational cost to recover 1 kg of lithium carbonate using this method is estimated at around
¥130, compared to ¥1,500/ kg when refining from ore.
•  Collaborative research is underway with Toyota Motor, nonferrous metals manufacturer DOWA,
and Chubu Electric.
•  Plans include a pilot plant capable of recovering several kilograms of lithium per month between
2025 and 2026.
•  CONTEXT: Japan plans to amend laws to mandate the recovery of rare metals from battery waste. Li-
ion batteries are widely used in EVs and for storing electricity generated from renewable energy sources.

An EV typically contains about 5 to 10 kg of lithium. However, due to the high cost and technical

challenges associated with lithium recovery, such as reactivity with impurities, the recovery rate
remains low, at 5–10%. While recycling technologies for metals like cobalt and nickel have advanced,
lithium recycling has lagged behind.

METI and MLIT: offshore wind projects from Round 1 can switch to FIP
(Government statement, March 10)
•  A meeting of a METI and MLIT-affiliated offshore wind promotion council clarified that projects
awarded through the Round 1 tender will be allowed to transition from the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) to
the Feed-in Premium (FIP).
•  Since the FIP launched in FY2022 before the Round 1 tender, this will be classified as a
"clarification of operations" rather than a "change."
•  The council pointed out that other power sources were allowed to switch to the FIP, and there is no
reason for offshore wind to be an exception.
•  Mitsubishi Corp, which won the Round 1 bids for three sea areas — offshore Noshiro City and
Yurihonjo City in Akita Pref, and offshore Choshi City in Chiba Pref – is reassessing the projects'
economic viability and scheduling.
•  With this decision, projects awarded in Round 1 can improve profitability through FIP conversion,
signing corporate PPAs, and utilizing battery storage for time-shifting power supply, all while
benefiting from FIP’ premium revenue.
•  There were also calls to clarify conditions to extend occupancy permits, particularly from the
perspective of reducing power generation costs through long-term operation.
• TAKEAWAY: The council’s decision signals a shift amid international scrutiny; this decision will shape future
offshore wind tenders and influence both domestic and foreign bidders. While Mitsubishi Corp is reassessing its
three projects, the focus is now on the govt’s next moves, with expectations for more adjustments to enhance
the attractiveness of Japan’s offshore wind sector. Industry members argue that bidding process changes for
Round 4 and beyond are insufficient to attract global players, who see better terms in other Asian markets.

Japan must provide clearer frameworks, especially for floating wind, and set up well-defined expectations for
regulatory improvements.

(Company statement, March 6)
•  Recycling firm Ibokin and wind power generation firm Achiha achieved 100% domestic resource
recycling by extracting permanent magnets from a direct-drive wind turbine generator dismantled
in Hyogo Pref in 2024.
•  The process was carried out both on-site and at Ibokin’s Tatsuno plant, after which the recycled
materials were sold to domestic users.
•  Direct-drive wind turbines commonly use rare-earth permanent magnets in their generators, such as
neodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, for which Japan has minimal domestic supply.
•  As wind turbines increase in size, the use of permanent magnet direct-drive systems is expected to
grow, leading to a higher demand for rare-earth magnets.



FLOWRA inks MoU with ORE to explore floating offshore wind tech

U.S. tech giants are betting on nuclear power to fuel AI data centers
(Reuters, March 13)
•  During CERAWeek in Houston, major companies like Amazon and Google signed a pledge to
support tripling global nuclear power capacity by 2050. Other signatories include Occidental and
Japan’s engineering major IHI Corp.
•  The World Nuclear Association is leading the initiative, hoping for support from industries such as
maritime, aviation, and oil & gas. Currently, nuclear power accounts for 9% of global electricity,
with 439 reactors. Yet, only about 411 reactors are operational, with a 371 GW total capacity.
•  CONTEXT: A medium sized data center needs power consumption of around 50 MW, while larger ones
need double or triple that figure. Estimates show that current power usage by data centers worldwide
requires around 55 GW, but many foresee a fourfold growth by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: SMRs seem to be at the center of the tech giants' talks. While Microsoft aims to restart the Three
Mile Island NPP, both Amazon and Google are betting on SMRs. One of the issues with SMRs is whether their
manufacturing costs can be reduced to make them a more cost-efficient alternative to GW-scale reactors. Google
said it hopes that costs can be brought down with innovation.

ANRE determined to restart Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP this summer
(Nikkei, March 14)
•  Discussions began in the Niigata Prefectural Assembly on the restart of TEPCO's Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa NPP. The govt aims to resume operations by this summer and emphasized the restart’s
importance.
•  Still, some Assembly members are concerned about evacuation procedures. Public understanding, a
key prerequisite for the restart, remains insufficient.
•  ANRE’s Director-General attended and said, "Restarting Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is crucial to addressing
the vulnerability of the power supply structure in East Japan." This was the first time a govt official
explained the restart’s importance to the Niigata Assembly since equipment preparation work for
Unit 7 in June 2024.
•  Governor Hanazumi Hideyo, however, remains cautious about making a decision.

•  CONTEXT: Public opposition to the restart remains. In the 2024 House of Representatives election, the
LDP suffered heavy losses in Niigata’s constituencies, which can be interpreted as local resistance. Even
among pro-nuclear LDP members, there is skepticism that the governor will move forward with a
decision anytime soon.
• TAKEAWAY: The urgency behind the govt and TEPCO's push for a summer restart stems from the fact that Unit
7 cannot operate beyond mid-Oct. TEPCO recently said anti-terrorism equipment completion for Unit 7 won’t
happen in time for the regulatory deadline. The govt seeks to restart Unit 7 before this.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

JERA urges Australia to boost LNG competitiveness amid U.S. expansion
(Company statement, March 11)
•  JERA's senior VP, Hitoshi Nishizawa, warned that Australian LNG will face more competition, such
as from expected increases in U.S. supply by the mid-2030s.
•  Many existing Japanese contracts with Australian LNG suppliers will expire around that time,
increasing uncertainty for future procurement, Nishizawa said.
•  CONTEXT: Australia is Japan’s top LNG supplier, providing close to 40% of all imports last year. The
second-largest seller, Malaysia, holds a 16% market share.
•  Nishizawa called for more investment incentives in Australian LNG, and state support for carbon
capture and storage to maintain competitiveness.
• TAKEAWAY: JERA, like Japan as a whole, would like to ensure that procurement remains diversified to hedge
risks associated with politics, logistics, etc. As the U.S. seeks to become a more prominent LNG seller, there are
opportunities for JERA to sign new contracts with U.S. projects. But switching to U.S. supply to a large degree
would limit the hedging strategy. Thus, it makes sense for JERA to encourage one of the world’s top LNG
exporters (Australia) to ensure that its fuels sector can thrive even though some in that country want an end to
the local oil and gas industry. That said, a recent report by Rystad Energy calls into question Australia’s ability
to remain an LNG exporter. With eastern Australia (which had previously stopped exports for a time) facing
energy shortfalls due to aging gas fields, and limited pipeline capacity, “LNG imports to Australia are looking
like an inevitability,” said Rystad.

Daiwa House, Osaka Univ reach methane-to-methanol breakthrough conversion rate

(Organization statement, March 11)
•  Daiwa House Industry, Japan’s largest homebuilder, and Osaka University, have developed a new
synthesis method that converts 89% of methane into methanol.
•  The process can utilize non-fossil-derived biogas from sources such as food waste and livestock
manure, without relying on natural gas.
•  The tech allows to downsize production equipment, even to 1/6 of original scale. Daiwa House
aims to first implement the tech in-house by around 2030.
•  CONTEXT: In 2017, a team led by Prof Okubo Takashi at Osaka Univ was the first to produce
methanol under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. But the conversion efficiency was only
14% and a large amount of raw material was needed. A conversion rate of 10–20% is considered the
commercially viable threshold.
•  The Daiwa-led research team achieved a breakthrough in conversion efficiency by using
perfluoroalkyl ether as the reaction solvent.
•  CONTEXT: Methanol is a critical chemical with a global market of 99 Mt as of 2024, projected to reach

Japan’s PPA Contract Volume and Size Expanded in

2024 Amid Push for More Variety

WHAT IS A PPA?
Corporate PPAs are generally 10- to 20-year power supply contracts between
consumers (buyers) and suppliers. The PPAs can be both physical and virtual. The
former works as a regular supply contract, with the buyer directly securing the
volumes for which they signed up. This can be either via the usual power line
transmission (offsite PPAs), or by adding generation equipment on the end-user’s
property (e.g., solar panels on a factory roof). The latter is called an Onsite PPA.
Virtual corporate PPAs, on the other hand, are derivatives. In this arrangement, the
power firm sells its electricity volume into the wholesale market, while the corporate
consumer gets power from a traditional retailer. The Virtual PPA acts as a contract for
the difference.

The extra benefit of the Virtual PPA is that the buyer can claim the environmental
value of the contracted electricity, regardless of how the power they actually receive
was produced. Put simply, the buyer can say they buy 100% green electricity, because
that’s what they paid for, while the actual electrons they receive may come from
thermal generation.
Physical PPA is a category under the Offsite PPA, when buyers purchase electricity
with environmental attributes such as renewable energy certificates from sellers.


The Japanese market for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) expanded last year while
also adding more variety in power sources and concluding deals that offered more
electricity capacity.

The number of publicly disclosed PPA deals tracked by Japan NRG in 2024 rose 18% to
226, compared to a year earlier. This brought the total capacity covered by deals over
the past two years to around 1.68 GW, our data show. We forecast that the rest of the
decade is likely to see further but uneven growth due to bottlenecks in supply and grid
constraints.
We began tracking publicly announced PPA deals from calendar year 2023. Our
database collects information on details divulged by the counterparties or the
government, and contains parameters such as electricity volumes, forecasted CO2
savings, type of contract, and the sector background of buyers and sellers. It does not
include contract prices as these are not shared by the parties publicly. However, based
on conversations with market players and references to additional sources, we have
included a section below that gives an outline of the price ranges and numbers based on
anecdotal / market average evidence.

Since the earliest known PPA deals in Japan appeared around 2020, the number of total
contracts is now estimated to be close to 500, covering over 2 GW in capacity. Market
players suggest that at least the same amount of capacity tied to PPA deals has not been
disclosed in the Japanese market, covering mainly in-house or onsite arrangements.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The following is a summary of the first part of a new special report by Japan NRG covering
the PPA sector, focusing on providing a practical snapshot of market trends and a basic
analysis of buyers/sellers, deal types, and environmental impact.
Dataset overview
Japan’s market for PPAs saw strong growth again in 2024. The number of projects
increased from 192 in 2023 to 226, up 18%, according to Japan NRG data tracking. The
average capacity of projects also increased. In 2023, nearly 60% of the PPA deals were
for less than 1 MW of capacity. But in 2024, the share of sub-1 MW deals dropped to
less than half, while almost 40% were between 1 MW and 5 MW.

The total capacity tied to PPA deals (based on disclosed numbers) was about 691 MW
(based on 184 out of 226 projects stating their capacity). This compares with 992 MW
in 2023 (based on 178 out of 192 projects revealing their capacity).

Over the past two years, the total PPA capacity disclosed surpassed 1.68 GW.
Considering the number of deals that are undisclosed and the PPAs signed from 2020 to
2022, we estimate that the total capacity in such agreements to date is over 2 GW and
likely closer to 2.5 GW.
The vast majority of that capacity (and deal numbers) remains linked to solar farms.
However, last year saw the emergence of onshore wind, hydro and mixed-source
agreements. There are also PPAs linked to offshore wind projects that are in a
preliminary stage and are therefore not covered in this report. We expect PPAs for
offshore wind farms to be finalized closer to the start of operations, in the latter part of
this decade.

Recent growth in the PPA market is based on several factors:
· Continued policy support for renewables to play a bigger role in the energy mix;
· Corporate sustainability commitments for both domestic and overseas firms
operating in Japan, which seek secure green power volumes;
· Desire to lock in prices in an electricity market that is expected to see more price
volatility as it embraces more intermittent power sources (without adequate energy
storage capabilities currently in place);
· Grid constraints, which limit new power source connections and delay the rollout of
more supply side, thus raising the value of green volumes already on the market.
One more important factor driving the uptick in energy demand is the construction of
new semiconductor production facilities in Kyushu and other regions, and the
proliferation of new data centers nationwide. Last year, Japan’s weather-adjusted
electricity demand rose 0.9% YoY, according to Yes Energy data. That compares with a
1.9% weather-corrected YoY drop in the 2023 calendar year.

Notably, physical and virtual PPAs remain the main tool for emission reduction for
corporations in Japan. The purchase of carbon credits as an offset mechanism is another
option since trading was launched on a trial basis on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
October 2023. The volumes – while showing YoY growth – represent a fraction of the
nation’s billion-ton CO2 footprint. So far, only credits representing about 675,000 tons
of CO2-equivalent have changed hands.

Cost of PPA
The costs of onsite PPA vary by the power generation capacity, contract period (number
of years), and area (of installation). Since PPA contract prices are not made public,
pricing information is usually only available on an anecdotal basis, either through
insiders familiar with certain deals, aggregator sites, or solar sector specialists, such as
Tokyo-based RTS Corporation. In addition, the Renewable Energy Institute (REI)
publishes an annual report that includes pricing information that references RTS
numbers.
Most sources concur that during the early years of PPA contracts in Japan, during the
2021 to 2022 period, the PPA contract price averaged around ¥11/ kWh (tax included).
That compared with an average 24h spot system price on the JEPX of ¥14.15/ kWh in
2021 and ¥22.30 in 2022.
Spot prices then fell to ¥11.93 on average for 2023 and ¥11.67 in 2024. However, PPA
contract prices rose due to rising costs for PV panels and electric equipment in the post-
pandemic period. Furthermore, a boom in onsite PPAs in Japan stoked demand, with
average PPA contract prices said to be at around ¥12 or higher in the past two years.
For smaller scale facilities, however, the PPA contract price can reach ¥20 or more.

For offsite physical PPAs tied to solar, the 2024 price range cited by REI based on RST
numbers was ¥13-16/ kWh (generation cost only, not including tax). Which brought the
total cost for consumers (including wheeling fees, retailer margins, renewable energy
surcharges, and tax) to about ¥25-28/ kWh for high voltage and ¥21-24 / kWh for
special high voltage. This was still lower than regular tariff in some cases, but no longer
an obvious money saver. It’s also worth mentioning that prices are subject to change
based on various conditions.
The basic numbers for offshore wind projects from the early auction rounds, which
would be structured mostly as virtual PPAs, are understood by Japan NRG to be around
the ¥23-26 level on average. That’s considerably higher than solar PPAs and still more
than for onshore wind projects, which tend to start in the mid ¥10s range.

A final point to note on pricing is that with the carbon credit trading system fully
launching in FY2026 and a fossil fuel levy introduced in 2028 the cost of CO2-emitting

even more attractive.

ANALYSIS

BY FILIPPO PEDRETTI

Japan to Increase Its LNG Carrier Fleet: Is the Global Market Strong Enough?
While the first international LNG shipment took place in 1959, only in the past decade
or so has the super-chilled fuel blossomed into a prospering global market. Today,
Japan is at the center of it, both as a major consumer, and due to its leading role in the
LNG shipping industry.

Currently, Japan is the world’s second largest LNG consumer, but it also transports over
30% of global LNG supplies. Not planning to rest on its laurels, Japan’s major shipping
companies seek to expand their LNG fleets by 40% through FY2030, reinforcing their
dominance in LNG transportation.

This status is in large part due to Japan’s geography – with no possibilities of importing
LNG via pipelines (as in Europe or U.S.), Japan has had to focus on maritime supply
routes.
Yet, the fleet expansion strategy hinges on the belief that LNG will maintain its status as
a vital energy source in the coming decades. While climate activists want to shut down
all fossil fuel usage, LNG is seen by the U.S. and many in Asia as an inexpensive lower-
carbon fuel, compared to coal.

If that holds, Japan’s maritime bet on the fuel’s future role will look as a strategically
smart play. Should LNG lose its luster over time, both Japan’s shipping industry and
power industry could be left in the lurch. As it is, the LNG market is a highly volatile
one, particularly sensitive to geopolitical vicissitudes. Japan NRG takes a look at the lay-
of-the-land in the country’s LNG transportation industry.
Leaders: MOL, NYK and K-Line
The global LNG carrier fleet has grown 90% since 2014, currently reaching 751 vessels.
Ten years ago, the number stood at around 400. While Japan is the top nation in carrier
operations, nearly 70% of all LNG transport ships are built in South Korea.

Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), the world’s top LNG transport owner, plans to increase its
LNG carrier fleet from the current 97 vessels to 140 by FY2029, and then up to 150 by
FY2030. This aggressive growth plan calls for investment of up to ¥600 billion.

In January, MOL signed its eighth long-term charter contract for a new LNG carrier.
South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries will build the vessel – 290 meters long and
with a 174,000 m³ membrane tank. When launched in 2026, MOL will manage the
ship’s operations for JERA, Japan’s largest power utility.
Also in January, the company launched a new LNG vessel, called MOL Azure, ordered by
MOL LNG Ship Management. It sails for a unit of TotalEnergies under a time charter
contract. The first loading was at a port in the U.S.

The LNG carrier MOL Azure

Besides MOL, the other two Japanese shipping giants, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) and
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K-Line), also plan to expand their LNG carrier fleets. NYK
targets a 30% increase to reach 120 vessels by FY2028, supported by ¥250–¥300 billion
in investments. K-Line plans the largest proportional increase, growing its fleet 60%,
from the current 47, to 75 by FY2030, with a similar investment range of ¥250–¥300
billion.
The three companies are expecting major profits in the late 2020s betting on rising LNG
demand. One factor that will determine the returns is ship ownership structure.
Hitherto, it was common for an LNG carrier to be shared among four or five parties, to
divide the burden of the costs. However, there’s a new trend where one ship is owned
by only two or maybe three parties; hence, less stakeholders with whom to divide the
profits.

All three major shipping companies intend to share vessel construction costs with
overseas partners. The price tag for one LNG carrier is about ¥30–40 billion, though
cost overruns are common. To help offset these costs, shipping companies are also
eyeing opportunities for long-term transport contracts.
A fluctuating market and rising LNG demand
Profits from shipping LNG are far from certain due to the challenges and volatility in the
market.

An excess of LNG carriers, and delays in new LNG terminals, has recently led to record-
low shipping rates. In December 2024, shipping rates for LNG carriers hit their lowest
levels since records began in 2018.

The primary reason was an abundance of vessels that had followed a surge in new ship
orders in 2022. Despite an expected rise in LNG production, delays in projects such as
the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas left many carriers idle. Estimates say the slump
could continue until 2027, when production and transport capacity reach a balance.

A key factor in the current global market turbulence has been U.S. energy policy. In
early 2024, President Biden imposed a halt on approvals for new LNG export projects,
24

leading to a reduction in expected LNG shipments, thus weakening charter rates. But,
with Trump’s election, these restrictions have been rescinded.

The change in energy direction under the Trump White House has been welcomed by
many governments in Asia, since the alternative LNG supply routes – from the Middle
East and Russia – have been disrupted by geopolitical tensions. For example, MOL was
impacted by military conflict in the Suez Canal area, and the company also had to alter
the purpose of three LNG carriers originally meant to serve Russia’s Arctic LNG 2 project
after the U.S. announced additional sanctions last year. For Europe, disruption of
pipeline-supplied gas from Russia has been a boost for LNG imports, requiring more
carriers.
LNG demand looks set to continue on an upward trajectory. Shell forecasts a 60% rise
in LNG demand to 2040, driven by increasing energy needs in Asia. Further growth
potential is in new markets such as South America.
Gas industry critic, the IEEFA, however, warns that structural LNG demand growth in
Asia could be constrained by diverse factors. Inherent volatility of LNG prices, coupled
with long development timelines for projects and large costs, may hinder a rapid
expansion.

















If the bullish forecasts are right, then broadly speaking, investing now will have the
advantage of low shipbuilding costs and charter rates ahead of future demand. With
U.S. exports expected to rise in the next few years, demand for ships to carry the fuel
should follow.
Global LNG trade volume now stands at around 400 million tons per year, but sector
analysts see it soaring to 700 million tons. MOL, for example, is undertaking its fleet
expansion based on forecasts for demand to reach 624 million tons a year by 2035.

Conclusion
Many countries have incorporated LNG into their decarbonization and energy
diversification strategies, but the question remains: is a higher LNG utilization rate
compatible with energy transition goals and will it be seen as such by future
governments?
There’s also the issue of energy security: will the LNG trade fall prey to geopolitics?
China’s pause on all future LNG contracts with the U.S. amid tariffs, counter-tariffs and
other trade tensions shows that at least one major buyer believes so.

Japan’s overall domestic LNG demand, which until very recently had been forecast by
METI to wane due to nuclear reactor restarts, a shift to green energy and depopulation,
means that the country’s shipping industry is making a high-stakes bet on the fuel’s
appeal across Asia.
Expanding the LNG fleet makes sense should Japanese firms be successful in selling the
fuel to developing countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the
Philippines. Beyond the CO2 footprint, this strategy also hinges on delivering the LNG
at lower prices than what consumers in Japan can accept – and beating international
players such as the traders and oil majors to the deals.

While the debates continue, Japan’s shippers are moving full-steam ahead.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / BESS
Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners will build a long-duration battery energy storage
system (BESS) in collaboration with CATL. Quinbrook said this will be the “world’s first
genuine 8-hour battery at more than double the current maximum 4-hour duration
BESS.”
Australia / Power bills
Power prices are set to rise again, as the Australian Energy Regulator lifts the caps on
how much retailers can charge. The default market offer will rise by up to 8.9% in some
areas, as the cost of power generation and the maintenance of the poles and wires
network keeps climbing.

China / Oil refining
Shandong Yulong Petrochemical is expected to soon start operating its second crude oil
processing unit. The start of full operations at the $20 billion complex would help lift
China's crude imports and its output of refined products in 2025.
China / Renewables
CLP China commissioned two renewable energy projects, doubling its renewable energy
portfolio in the Mainland. One is the 150 MW Bobai Wind Farm. The other project is
the 90-MW Yixing Phase I Solar Power Station in Jiangsu.

India / Renewables
Tata Power Renewable Energy will develop 7 GW of clean energy projects in Andhra
Pradesh. This will include solar, wind, and hybrid projects with or without storage
solutions.
India / Coal imports
India’s coal imports from April to December 2024 reached 183.42 MT, falling 8.4%
from the same period last year.

Indonesia / Natural gas
Sembcorp terminated a gas deal with West Natuna Exploration, Empyrean Energy, and
Coro Energy Duyung. “As regulatory approval in Indonesia has not been obtained, the
GSA will accordingly be terminated,” Sembcorp said.
Malaysia / Power turbines
Worldwide Holding Berhad’s 1.2 GW Pulau Indah combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)
power plant in Malaysia has started operation.

Offshore wind
Uncertainty in the U.S. offshore wind market following the reelection of Trump presents
an opportunity for APAC and Europe. “Trump’s election has undoubtedly reduced the
confidence in parts of the offshore wind industry for some time, but we need to
recognise how shifting momentum can help us turn adversity into opportunity,” said
Tim Fischer, director for Ramboll’s Global Wind Division.
Singapore / Offshore wind
A joint report on Offshore Wind Power Trade Cooperation between Vietnam and
Singapore was endorsed on March 12. The report facilitates regulatory approvals and

27

licences from both countries for renewable energy development and cross-border
electricity trading.
South Korea / Offshore wind
Deep Wind Offshore Korea, the subsidiary of Norwegian developer Deep Wind Offshore
(DWO), secured a Public Waters Occupancy and Use Permit (PWOP) for its 1.5 GW
Abalone offshore wind farm off southwestern South Korea. The Abalone project is part
of a partnership between DWO and BP to develop four offshore wind projects with a
potential capacity of 6 GW across the Korean peninsula.
