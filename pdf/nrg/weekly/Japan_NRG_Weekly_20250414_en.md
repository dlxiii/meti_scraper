NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


China tightens rare-earth export controls, posing risk to Japan's supply chains

(Nikkei, April 9)
•  China has expanded export restrictions on seven additional rare earths, including dysprosium and
terbium that are used in EVs and advanced magnets, significantly impacting supply chains for
Japanese high-tech sectors.
•  Japan and the U.S. together account for 53% of China's rare-earth exports, making them primary
targets of the tightened controls. With these restrictions, procurement delays are already reported as
approvals slow down.
•  CONTEXT: Amid China's geopolitical leverage, Japan is accelerating efforts to diversify its rare-earth
sourcing. In March, Tokyo announced a €100 million investment in a French rare-earth refining venture
to reduce reliance on Chinese processing. Japan also invested in Australian rare-earth projects in the past
decade.
•  China's tighter controls follow its 2024 move declaring rare-earth resources state-owned,
consolidating their processing strictly within state-backed companies.
• TAKEAWAY: This pause raises concerns for Japan's long-term security in tech sectors. The U.S. is China’s main
target with the latest restrictions, and it might ease the restrictions towards Japan as a way to drive a wedge in
relations with Washington. Securing supply without hurting relations with either China or the U.S. will be a
conundrum for PM Ishiba.



Kansai Electric raises ¥30 bln via transition bonds for nuclear, hydrogen projects
(Company disclosure, April 10)
•  KEPCO issued ¥30.7 billion ($200 million) in transition bonds to finance NPP safety upgrades and
next-gen fuel projects, including hydrogen.
•  The bonds have maturities of 10 and 20 years, with interest rates of 1.766% and 2.367%,
respectively; this marks KEPCO’s second set of transition bond issuance following a ¥45 billion
offering in July 2022.

•  Funds will also support upgrades at existing thermal power plants, such as the Nanko Power Plant in
Osaka, in response to rising power demand driven by AI adoption.
•  The bond sales were managed by Daiwa and Nomura securities firms, among others.
• TAKEAWAY: Transition bonds are a subset of ESG bonds. Last year’s ¥20 billion issuance of transition bonds by
JAL was six times oversubscribed. Transition finance is of more interest in Japan than in other markets because
many local companies seek capital for energy sources other than renewables. While these projects are important
to cutting emissions, and thus consistent with limiting global warming according to the Climate Bonds Initiative,
which monitors the integrity of bond issuances, international investors tend to shy away from transition bonds in
favor of green finance. It’s interesting to note that KEPCO’s second issuance of transition bonds is smaller than the
first one in 2022, but still sizable.



Mitsubishi HC Capital and Sanei to generate J-Credits from solar clients
(Company statement, April 9)
•  Mitsubishi HC Capital and Sanei have launched a project that will generate J-Credits based on
adoption of solar power.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The companies will aggregate the CO2 reductions of companies and households that install Sanei’s
solar power systems and convert them into J-Credits.
•  The first certification, scheduled for March 2026, is expected to generate approx. 100 tons of credits.
By 2030, the project aims to create about 900 tons of carbon credits.
•  CONTEXT: Japan plans to achieve 15 Mt of its 2030 GHG reduction target through the use of J-Credits.



MoE offers subsidies for firms that lease equipment for decarbonization
(Government statement, April 10)
•  The MoE said applications are now open for designated leasing providers and exemplary initiatives
under the FY2025 ESG Lease Promotion Program, which supports decarbonization efforts through
subsidies for leasing low-carbon equipment.
•  More information can be found here.



Toyo to appeal fine imposed in Brazil on bribery suspicion

(Company statement, media reports, April 8)
•  Toyo Engineering will file an objection with Brazil’s comptroller general’s office responsible for anti-
corruption, after the agency imposed a fine of 560 million reais (about ¥14 billion, or $140 million)
on suspicion of bribery.
•  Toyo said it was not involved in any wrongdoing. The issue involves a project awarded in 2011 to a
consortium that included a Toyo Engineering subsidiary. The project was for construction at a
petrochemical complex in Rio de Janeiro state, commissioned by Petrobras.
•  Authorities suspect Toyo paid a bribe equal to 1% of the contract to Petrobras execs.



NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


TEPCO to trial hydrogen production for balancing the power grid

(Nikkei, April 10)
•  TEPCO HD plans to trial using hydrogen production systems as a rapid-response mechanism for
balancing the grid, especially at times of excess solar generation. The company joined the Balancing
Market in April.
•  TEPCO is partnering with Yamanashi Pref at a Kofu City facility to test how well electrolyzer-based
hydrogen systems work as a “demand adjustment valve.” The project is the first in Japan to register
hydrogen equipment as a primary adjustment power source (i.e., it must respond within 30 seconds of
receiving instructions.)
•  The partners have three electrolysers at the Kofu site that can be used for balancing. Each one
requires 500 kW of power.
•  CONTEXT: TEPCO, Totay Industries, and Yamanashi Pref last year established the Yamanashi Hydrogen
Company (YHC) to develop and operate P2G (Power to Gas) systems. The facilities use renewable energy
to power electrolyzers that make hydrogen. YHC is also engaged in the storage and transportation of
hydrogen.
• TAKEAWAY: If successful, TEPCO could turn to hydrogen systems as an alternative to thermal power plants as a
regulating power source. PEM electrolyzers are the most responsive of hydrogen-production facilities and have

performed well in tests so far. The issue for TEPCO to tackle will be how to operate the electrolyzer systems at
scale and ensure that cost remains reasonable even as the equipment is used sporadically.



JEPX spot electricity market marks 20 years, trading volume up 300-fold since launch
(Denki Shimbun, April 8)
•  The Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX), which began electricity trading in April 2005, celebrated
its 20th anniversary, with annual trading volumes increasing nearly 300-fold to about 30% of Japan's
total electricity demand.
•  JEPX membership has grown from an initial 27 companies to 320 today, passing the 100-member
milestone in 2015, driven by liberalization and new market entrants.
•  JEPX, which is is upgrading its transaction systems and organizational capabilities, has maintained
consistent trading rules, providing stable power procurement channels for new market entrants (shin
denryoku, 新電力, or PPS).



Capacity market reduces penalties for the power generation side

(Denki Shimbun, April 10)
•  OCCTO has decided to reduce economic penalties in the capacity market.
•  The assumed occurrence time for 'capacity provision notices', a factor determining the penalty
amount, has been changed from the current 30 hours to 90 hours. Thus, the penalty will be lowered.
•  CONTEXT: The frequency of provision notices has increased and the burden on power plant operators
grew after FY2024.
•  If it’s expected that the wide-area reserve rate will fall below 8% after 6 PM the day before
consumption, a 'capacity provision notice' is issued to operators who have signed capacity assurance
contracts. The notified power plants are required to operate and bid in the spot market, among other
obligations.
•  Penalties are calculated by multiplying the capacity that did not bid, despite receiving the notice, by a
certain ratio (penalty rate). That rate is based on the expected hours in which the wide-area reserve
rate is anticipated to be below 8%.



Singapore’s Sembcorp to double stake in Senoko, co-owned by Japan’s Lion Power
(The Straits Times, other media, April 2)
•  Sembcorp Industries, a Singaporean state-owned energy firm, signed a sale and purchase agreement
that will increase its interest in local electric utility firm Senoko Energy to a maximum of 70%.
•  Sembcorp will acquire up to 57.1% in Lion Power, which holds a 70% interest in Senoko Energy.
•  Lion Power is owned by a JV comprising Marubeni, KPIC Netherlands, Kyuden International and
Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Marubeni holds the remaining 42.9% interest in Lion
Power.

Global LNG prices to remain high until at least 2028, says Trafigura CEO

(Nikkei, April 11)
•  Trafigura CEO Richard Holtum expects LNG prices, currently around $11 per million BTU for Asia, to
remain elevated until at least 2028, citing sustained European demand following reduced Russian
pipeline gas supplies.
•  Significant new U.S. LNG production capacity will likely not come online fully until after 2028 due to
typical construction delays, prolonging current high prices.

ANALYSIS

BY MAGDALENA OSUMI

What Can Japan’s Offshore Wind Sector Learn from Other Asian Countries?
Japan is preparing to launch the fourth round of offshore wind power auctions under its
public tender scheme, which has so far allocated around 3.1 GW of capacity. However,
uncertainties over upcoming amendments to the system are raising doubts about the long-
term viability of the country's offshore wind development.

Once seen as one of Asia’s most promising offshore wind markets, Japan is at risk of losing
momentum. Several international developers recently opted out of tenders, turning their
focus to other Asia-Pacific markets. A complicated auction system and concerns over
financial feasibility have made Japan less attractive for offshore wind investment.

In contrast, Taiwan and South Korea have had more success in advancing their offshore
wind sectors due to adjustments that have created more transparent and investor-friendly
auction systems, which are drawing significant competition and funding. This situation
offers clear lessons for Japan as it seeks to rebuild confidence and revive interest.
Offshore wind is still Japan’s main pathway for adding dozens of GW of green capacity in
the 2030s, according to the nation’s energy strategy. Developers want officials to act in
ways that confirm this commitment.

Background: Challenges in the bidding system
Japan’s offshore wind sector faces a myriad of challenges, including complex permitting
procedures, limited sea space, and constrained grid access. These issues are compounded
by an auction system that in the early auction rounds overly focused on price, which led to
unsustainably low bids.
A case in point is the Mitsubishi Corp-led consortium, which was awarded three large-
scale projects in Round 1, but which has threatened to walk away from the developments
and the sector unless the government can accommodate the increase in costs it has seen
over the past three years due to higher materials and EPC costs, and a weaker yen.

While the auction rules were amended after Round 1 to put more attention on the
timescale of project development, the next two rounds saw developers bid at a “zero
premium” price level. This means, the project would not receive a top-up payment from
the state for the electricity it produces and would rely on sales to the market and to
anchor clients under PPA contracts to recover the investment.

Since the bids were made, costs have continued to rise while electricity buyers under PPA
deals are reluctant to agree to higher prices, squeezing developers. This has made some
reluctant to participate in new auctions until there is a better pricing environment in place
either via the state or with offtakers. Few developers are ready to fight for new capacity
based on low project costs that leave little margin to correct for unforeseen expenses or
delays.
The impasse has dire consequences. Expected CO2 emission reductions from the rollout of
offshore wind farms are baked into Japan’s NDC commitments. And at this early stage of
the sector’s development, both the developers and the electricity buyers expect the
government to take the lead in resolving the issues.

METI has stepped up, promising a number of changes from Round 4 that take into
account the variables in cost, and has regularly met with industry participants to source
both feedback and details of how similar issues were addressed in other countries.
So far, however, a degree of skepticism, especially from non-Japanese developers, remains
over the effectiveness of the proposed reforms. Developers want more specifics on future
auction size and timelines, a roadmap of the areas where new wind farms will be allowed,
and more flexibility on supply chain and project management. In this sense, the markets
near Japan offer useful case studies.

The value of a centralized approach
South Korea and Taiwan demonstrate how centralized, transparent frameworks can create
a stable investment environment.

In South Korea, the proposed Special Act, submitted in June 2024, aims to reform the
fragmented permitting system by introducing a one-stop-shop model led by a dedicated
Offshore Wind Power Development Committee.
This move mirrors successful European systems, such as those in Denmark and the
Netherlands, and could significantly reduce project risk, improve predictability, and
shorten development timelines currently stretching to seven to nine years.

South Korea also benefits from strong fundamentals: high energy demand, advanced
infrastructure, and a robust industrial base. Combined with ambitious renewable energy
targets – 21.6% by 2030, and 32.9% by 2038, and contributing to a 120 GW total
renewable energy goal – the country is flagging its long-term opportunities for investors.

Taiwan’s shift toward flexibility and openness
Taiwan is also adapting to changing market conditions. In the latest Round 3.2 auction,
the government introduced more flexibility in how winning projects can be developed.
The goal is to address implementation challenges experienced by both local and European
developers.
In a landmark policy shift, Taiwan pledged to eliminate localization requirements from
future auctions. Once a major barrier for international players, these will no longer be
included as eligibility conditions or award criteria. The move followed a WTO
consultation initiated by the EU in July 2024 that challenged Taiwan’s local content rules
as discriminatory.

It stands in striking contrast with Japan’s plan to raise its domestic procurement goal for
offshore wind farms to roughly 70% in 2040 from the current 60%. The move is aimed at
building up the local supply chain to potentially reduce costs of wind turbine imports. A
decision is expected by this summer.
Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs reaffirmed the country’s commitment to offshore
wind as a pillar of its 2050 net-zero goal and energy security strategy. The focus is now on
ensuring timely grid connection and project execution over rigid industrial relevance
plans.

Starting 2025, Taiwan will adopt a more liberalized, developer-friendly framework. With
the removal of local content mandates, the market is expected to attract broader
international participation to revive the sector on the island. As elsewhere, Taiwan has
faced a combination of policy instability, near-zero feed-in tariffs, and infrastructure
bottlenecks, which in recent years saw several major players exit the market.

South Korea’s offshore wind gains speed
In October 2024, South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) launched
a long-awaited 2.8 GW renewable energy tender, which includes 1.5 GW of offshore wind.
This proved to be a major step for the offshore wind sector.
Of the 1.5 GW allocated, 1 GW is dedicated to bottom-fixed, and 500 MW to floating
wind. The government set a uniform price cap of KRW 176.565/ MWh ($128) for both
types, a move that surprised analysts due to floating wind’s higher costs. However,
floating wind projects benefit from higher renewable energy certificate (REC) multipliers,
which could help balance the economics.

The auction also introduced a balanced scoring system – 50% price, 50% non-price –
covering industrial benefits, grid connection, community acceptance, and project
readiness. For the first time, ceiling prices were made public, reflecting a 5% increase
from 2023 to account for inflation. This transparency is another positive signal to
investors.
These developments show South Korea’s confidence in the rapid innovation of floating
wind technology, which is especially significant when compared to Japan, where floating
wind turbines remain in the early demonstration phase, with just 34 MW installed.

Lessons learned
Japan stands at a crossroads. While it was once seen as a regional frontrunner, its rigid
auction structure, permitting delays, and policy uncertainty are driving developers to
explore more predictable markets.

The progress made by Taiwan and South Korea illustrates key lessons:
•  Flexibility and transparency attract investors and support project execution.
•  Centralized permitting can reduce delays and administrative burdens.
•  Balanced auction criteria help prevent overly aggressive bids and improve long-
term viability.
•  Removing localization mandates opens markets to global supply chain players,
which lowers cost through increased competition.
South Korea’s centralized permitting reforms and balanced auction structure, combined
with strong domestic demand and industrial capacity, has set a new standard in Asia.
Taiwan’s removal of local content barriers and focus on timely project delivery also
demonstrate how government responsiveness can reignite investor interest.

If Japan can implement similar reforms – streamlining approvals, increasing transparency,
and focusing on execution over cost minimization – it has the potential to re-establish
itself as a regional leader in offshore wind. That’s important to secure the ships, human
resources, and capital needed to develop offshore wind energy in Japan.

Recent METI statements indicate that the role of renewable energy in Japan has come to
be recognized as not only one of reducing emissions but also as a means of achieving
greater energy security. That factor should motivate officials to find the compromises the
industry seeks to move forward and unlock the nation’s green potential.

From Importer to Trader: LNG Activity Grows Despite

Shrinking Domestic Demand
Japan is experiencing a dramatic shift in its energy landscape. LNG imports have been on
a downward trend in the past several years due to shrinking domestic demand, and this
looks set to continue. Total LNG imports in 2024 were 65.9 million tons, around the same
volume as FY2023, when there was a slight decrease from the previous year.

By 2030, total LNG demand could drop to 50 million tons, with more aggressive estimates
suggesting even 30 million tons. In response, major Japanese players are adapting to these
new market conditions, with ambitions to become key traders in LNG markets across Asia.
None of this is accidental. In 2020, METI unveiled its "New Strategy for International
Resources" that set a target to handle 100 million tons of LNG a year by FY2030. That
target includes LNG volumes to be traded to third countries amid the building of a strong
international sales network.

Such plans come at an opportune time for Japan. Global LNG demand is set to rise, and if
production doesn’t meet this new demand, prices will of course rise. In order to better
understand the situation and forecast the future, Japan NRG takes a closer look at recent
developments and strategies in the LNG market.

Hedging excess supply through trading
According to JOGMEC, in both FY2019 and FY2020 Japan handled over 100 million tons
of LNG, peaking at 110 million tons in FY2020 and FY2021. Since then, the total has
decreased to 103 million tons. The major change in LNG for domestic consumption
registered a sharp decrease. That figure dropped from a little over 80 million tons in
FY2018 to about 65 million tons in FY2023.
In 2023, Japanese utilities were reselling about 37% of the LNG they purchased, up from
16% in 2018. By FY2023 the LNG for external trade grew to 38 million tons, up from just
under 15 million tons in FY2018.

New long-term contracts inked by Japanese companies was a major factor in this
significant new stage in LNG trading. Nevertheless, as domestic demand continues to
drop, more supply will have to find new markets. Breaking long-term contracts means
incurring hefty penalties: therefore, Japanese traders might be tempted to re-sell LNG at
lower prices in order to offload supply; unless global demand takes a sudden jump in the
coming years.
In this regard, it’s worth comparing Spot Asian LNG prices and Japan LNG import prices,
which roughly accounts for 80% of long-term contracts linked to crude oil prices and 20%
from spot contracts, leaving it less susceptible to the volatile spot market.

companies.





























Source: JOGMEC

In February, spot Asian LNG prices hit $16.10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu: 1
ton of LNG equals to around 52-53 mmBtu), before dropping to $13.50. It stood at $8.30
at the same time last year, and for the most part has hovered around $13/mmBtu in the
past few months. As for Japan NRG data, the LNG import price for February 2025 stood at
¥94,314 / ton, or a little more than $12/mmBtu (leaving some margins for conversions).
JERA, Tokyo Gas and raising global demand
Each year, JERA handles about 30 to 35 million tons of LNG, and has set a target of
handling 35 million tons a year by 2035. Part of that total is sold to Asian countries, but
JERA doesn't specify how much. Toward this goal, it plans to invest ¥1 to ¥2 trillion in
infrastructure.

Tokyo Gas handles from 13 to 19 million tons of LNG a year, with a target of 5 million
tons of LNG to be sold off to third parties each year by 2030, up from 3 million tons today.
The company plans to handle 20 million tons by 2030, and to trade around one quarter of
that LNG. Tokyo Gas is eyeing Southeast Asia for LNG supply chain development as that
regions’ energy consumption is on track to rise rapidly in the coming decade; but the
company is also eager to source LNG from Australia and the U.S.


21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

While there are diverse forecasts, it’s safe to say that 2030 global LNG demand will be
around 550 million tons. If Japan can keep its goal of handling 100 million tons of LNG,
this would be a little less than 20%; currently Japan handles almost a quarter of global
demand.
JERA and Tokyo Gas account for about 50% of the total volume handled by Japan. In
2030, considering their target goals, the volumes of JERA’s contracts would be 6% (down
from the current 8%) of global demand, and around 3.6% for Tokyo Gas (down from
4.5% today).

Besides Japan’s shrinking position in the market, media such as Reuters, noted that
significant growth in LNG global demand could also lead to oversupply and subsequent
falling prices, a risk for LNG resellers.

Destination clauses and LNG prices
A significant hurdle in Japan’s LNG strategy has been the use of destination clauses in
long-term LNG contracts; they restrict the resale of LNG, limiting the flexibility of
Japanese companies to trade surplus gas. A goal of 2020's plan was working to remove
these clauses from contracts, allowing for more fluid trade. Another option supported by
the government is to buy LNG on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.
JOGMEC published the results of a survey on LNG transactions, and contracts with
destination clauses accounted for 42% of all contracts in FY2022, but declined to 39% in
FY2023. When taking an ever broader look at the data, contracts with destination clauses
nearly halved in less than a decade, from 75% in FY2016, to 39% in FY2023. By FY2030,
such contracts are set to fall to 34%.

JOGMEC told Japan NRG that LNG sourced from the U.S. has no destination restrictions.
American LNG exports are expected to reach an annual volume of 180 million tons by
2030, which should account for one-third of global supply. Combined with the increase in
trading volume and market participants, this has played a role in enhancing market
liquidity. JOGMEC also said it expects the U.S. to increase LNG supply through 2030, with
55% of the global LNG supply growth from 2025 to 2030 most likely to be sourced from
the U.S.

Conclusion
Japanese involvement in LNG infrastructure development across Asia is expanding (as
Japan NRG will show in next week’s issue). But if the LNG global sector sees the gigantic
growth in demand that some analysts foresee, Japan’s overall market presence will
diminish.
As LNG sellers, Japanese targets for 2030 probably won’t keep pace with the global
volumes; while as an importer, Japan’s declining domestic demand is already considered a
given.

In a broader perspective, there seems to be a contradiction in Japan’s LNG strategy. On
the one hand, Japan justifies its increased LNG trade volumes as a matter of energy
security. If its companies secure a strong position as resellers, then they can sell the gas
overseas in case of excess supplies, averting a glut.

On the other hand, for the same energy security reasons, Japan launched the Strategic
Buffer (SBL), a state-backed LNG reserve program for obtaining emergency supplies
amidst demand peaks, with JOGMEC covering financial risks.
In other words,while the private sector secures LNG volumes for overseas trading, the
domestic energy security burden falls on the government. The government should be
more explicit when advancing its LNG strategies, clarifying the country’s energy needs, its
role and that of corporate players when it concerns securing supplies.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / BESS
The State Electricity Commission in Victoria said that developer OX2 is building the 200
MWh SEC Renewable Energy Park, which will see a 100 MW/ 200 MWh battery energy
storage system (BESS) co-located with a 119 MW solar PV power plant.
China / LNG from the U.S.
For over 60 days, China hasn’t imported LNG from the U.S.; this is the longest gap in five
years, according to analytics firm Kpler. Zero LNG trade between China and the U.S. is
likely to continue for the rest of 2025 due to Trump’s tariffs.

China / LNG resales
Meanwhile, Chinese buyers of LNG are re-selling U.S.-sourced cargoes as tit-for-tat tariffs
drive up import costs. The trend is set to accelerate as new multi-year supply deals kick in
this month and domestic demand weakens, said Rystad.
China / LPG
Chinese liquefied petroleum gas buyers have prompted a price surge as they seek to
replace U.S. supplies of the fuel following Beijing’s response to Trump’s tariffs. Buyers are
trying to swap U.S. cargoes with alternatives, including LPG from the Middle East.

Coal Power
The world saw its lowest coal power increase in two decades, with just 44 GW of new
capacity added in 2024, according to Global Energy Monitor. The coal fleet rose less than
1% in 2024, a net increase of 19 GW; in the EU, 25 GW of capacity was retired last year.
India / Energy tax
The world’s third-largest oil consumer increased its special additional excise duty on
gasoline to 13 rupees (15 cents) a liter, up from 11 rupees. The duty on diesel will be
raised to 10 rupees a liter from 8 rupees, said the finance ministry.

India / Green hydrogen
Bharat Petroleum Corp and Sembcorp Green Hydrogen India inked a deal to explore
renewable energy and green hydrogen projects across India.

India / Renewable power
In March, India issued around 5.1 GW of renewable energy tenders, according to JMK
Analytics. One tender was from NHPC for a 1.2 GW solar project with a 600 MW/ 1.2
GWh energy storage system.
Indonesia / Waste energy
Waste-to-energy (WtE) processing businesses are attracting interest from foreign
investors, particularly from Singapore, Japan, and China. In response, the govt is working
to simplify regulations and promote ease of doing business, especially involving capital
and technology.

Renewable energy
