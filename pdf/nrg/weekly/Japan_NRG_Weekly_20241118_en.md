NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





METI/ MLIT to consider revision to pricing and evaluation criteria for offshore wind

(Government statement, Nov 12)
•  METI and MLIT plan to revise price evaluation points in offshore wind auctions to ensure that
developers can achieve expected returns when submitting bids.
•  A METI subcommittee is specifically looking at changes in materials costs and exchange rate
fluctuations between the bidding and construction phases.
•  The govt also seeks to introduce a semi-premium level. Currently, a zero-premium level is set at a
FIP reference price of ¥3/ kWh, which is a benchmark rate to ensure that consumers face no

additional burden. This level is much lower than market rates.
•  The new semi-zero premium rate will refer to the average wind power profile market price over the
past 3 years in the wholesale electricity market. As the current 3-year average stands at ¥14.94/
kWh, the rate will be set at ¥14/ kWh to limit any burden on consumers.
•  The proposal includes adjustment mechanisms in case of inflation or deflation. The new system is
expected to launch in FY2025, coinciding with the Round 4 tender.
•  CONTEXT: A proposal was presented where a price of ¥14/ kWh would yield 104 points in the

price evaluation part of bids. The logic is that awarding 104 points for ¥14/ kWh is based on the
average point gap of around 16 between those operators that were selected and the runners-up in
the business feasibility part of the evaluation in Round 2 tenders. Under the previous system, if a
project bidder offered ¥3/ kWh and the runner-up bid ¥9/ kWh, the point gap was 80 points,
making it nearly impossible for the runner-up to catch up in the non-price section of the evaluation.
• TAKEAWAY: Due to rising costs, some global wind power projects face interruptions or cancellation,

prompting governments to revise their sector support frameworks. Japan is only following suit. With those
factors in mind, while maintaining the zero-premium level concept, the policy will recognize that even bids
above this level, if reasonably priced, can alleviate the burden on consumers. The new approach aims to
promote business plans resilient to changes such as cost fluctuations.



Govt will resume subsidizing electricity and gas bills, Jan to March 2025

(Japan NRG, Denki Shimbun, Nov 15)
•  To counteract rising fuel bills, Japan will resume subsidizing electricity and gas bills starting
January 2025 and running until March.
•  A subsidy for electricity and gas bills was introduced in January 2023 to alleviate the burden on
household budgets, and was terminated in May 2024. But it was reinstated from August to
October 2024 due to the hot summer that in turn led to higher bills.
•  The gasoline subsidy, which was due to expire at the end of the year, is expected to be extended

until March 2025.
•  CONTEXT: The government has allocated more than ¥11 trillion to subsidies for gasoline and
electricity and gas bills. In addition to discontent over the huge budget outlay, there’s persistent

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI says electricity provider Smart Tech failed to pay levies
(Government statement, Nov 12)
o  METI disclosed the name of an electricity provider, Smart Tech, that failed to pay levies
collected from electricity users by Oct 31, and also missed the extended deadline
specified by OCCTO (Nov 11).
o  CONTEXT: Under the Renewable Energy Special Measures Act, the METI Minister is

obligated to publicly disclose the name of any electricity retailer that fails to comply with
such payment obligations.



ANRE proposes draft to develop a support system for the CCS industry
(Government statement, Nov 8)
•  ANRE outlined key issues necessary to set up a support system for a thriving carbon capture and
storage industry in Japan. The goals of this system include enabling Japanese companies to offer
competitively priced and stable CCS solutions, supporting the international competitiveness of

carbon-intensive industries, and advancing decarbonization in the energy sector.
•  To make CCS commercially viable, subsidies are proposed to bridge the cost gap between CCS
and conventional CO2 abatement methods, covering both capital expenditures and operational
expenses. This support should be sustained over the medium to long -term until CCS costs fall
below those of traditional abatement.
•  The system should avoid duplicating existing support measures, such as the "auction for

compensation" for power generators within the GX-ETS (Green Transformation Emission Trading
System), and the inclusion of thermal power with CCS in long-term decarbonization auctions. Also,
toward the goal of launching CCS projects by 2030, it’s essential to develop storage sites at home
and internationally.
•  CONTEXT: The global CCS market is still in an early and uncertain stage. While Europe and the
U.S. support CCS with budgets, tax incentives, and credits, Japan faces challenges due to limited
storage potential in depleted oil and gas fields, making it difficult to create a cost-effective CCS

value chain.

• TAKEAWAY: With the passage of the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act, Japan’s "Low-Carbon Hydrogen
Supply Chain Construction Support Project" is set to launch. It mandates adherence to carbon intensity
standards for low-carbon hydrogen. Until green hydrogen becomes widely available, blue hydrogen derived
from fossil fuels is likely to dominate. For fossil-fuel-based hydrogen, CCS and non-fossil fuel certifications are
required, making CCS crucial for the broader adoption of low-carbon hydrogen and related fuels.

industries such as design and construction of rigs, offshore platforms and specialized
vessels.



No bids in OCCTO tender for bottom-fixed offshore wind farms

(Government statement, Nov 5)
•  OCCTO’s third (FY2024) auction for bottom-fixed offshore wind power generation projects drew
no bids.
•  On offer was a total capacity of 190 MW, with a price cap set at ¥24/ kWh.
•  CONTEXT: The auction is held separately from tenders under the Act on Promotion of Use of
Marine Areas for Development of Marine Renewable Energy Generation Facilities overseen by
METI and MLIT.
• TAKEAWAY: The officials continue to seek lower prices / tariffs from renewable energy developers but the lack

of bids in this auction shows that ricing EPC and materials costs no longer make smaller projects feasible even
at ¥24. Equally, this indicates that those companies interested in offshore wind are more likely to work on
projects of several hundred MWs. The time of buildings small to medium-sized offshore wind farms is likely
coming to an end.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
OCCTO’s 7th biomass power generation tender drew no bids
(Government statement, Nov 5)
o  OCCTO’s latest auction for biomass power generation projects ended with no winners as
the auction round failed to attract any bids.
o  OCCTO offered 30 MW of capacity with a price cap set at ¥17.8/ kWh.

o  CONTEXT: The eligible facilities in this tender were power generation facilities using
general wood biomass and with a power output of 10 MW or more, as well as facilities
using liquid biomass fuel limited to those with a capacity of 50 kW or more. The price cap
was not disclosed.

JERA told to amend practices in wake of withholding surplus electricity
(Government statement, Japan NRG, Nov 12)
•  The power sector regulator, the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC), sent a
business improvement recommendation to JERA, citing Article 66 of the Electricity Business Act

that aims to protect consumers. The commission said that JERA withheld surplus electricity from
the spot (day-ahead) market between April 2019 (or earlier) and October 2023.
•  From Oct 2020 to Oct 2023, about 5.4 TWh of electricity was withheld, which caused significant
price impacts, with daily settlement prices rising by more than ¥50/ kWh on certain days. This
practice was found to violate the Guidelines on Proper Electricity Transactions, which prohibit
actions intended to manipulate or significantly impact market prices through trading or withholding
trades.

•  JERA repeatedly failed to submit bids when power plant output was reduced due to issues such as
transmission line inspections. The company attributed this to malfunctions in its bidding tools, but
did not take corrective action despite some employees being aware of the issue as early as 2019.
•  JERA has been instructed to:
o  Conduct a comprehensive review of its bidding processes for the spot market, identify
practices that may have influenced prices outside genuine supply-demand dynamics, and

update systems and revise relevant policies.
o  Implement measures to prevent recurrence, including stronger internal oversight and
compliance training for employees on regulatory adherence.
•  JERA must submit a report outlining corrective measures by Dec 12.
• TAKEAWAY: Suppliers with significant market power are expected to offer to the wholesale market their
surplus electricity at marginal cost and in full volume. Unjustified deviations, such as withholding electricity or
pricing above marginal costs, may be construed as market manipulation. This recommendation seeks to ensure

transparency and fair competition in the wholesale electricity market and to strengthen public trust.



KEPCO plans to raise up to ¥505 billion to fund equipment upgrade
(Company statement, Nikkei, Nov 13)
•  Kansai Electric announced plans to raise up to ¥504.9 billion through new share issuance and the

sale of treasury shares. This marks the company's second public equity offering since 1982 and
represents its largest-ever fundraising effort.
•  The money received will be used to upgrade high-efficiency LNG power equipment, invest in data
centers and nuclear power plant life extensions.
•  KEPCO plans to issue around 148.28 million new shares through a public offering and another
29.09 million shares through a third-party allotment. This will increase its total outstanding shares
from about 938.73 million to roughly 1.116 billion.
•  From the raised funds, ¥215.9 billion will be allocated to updating equipment at the Nanko Power

Station in Osaka; ¥17 billion will go toward extending the operational life of Units 3 and 4 at the
Takahama NPP in Fukui Pref to 60 years.
•  KEPCO will also sell nearly all of its 45.7 million treasury shares through the public offering. The
price for the shares will be determined based on market close between Nov 26-29, with payment
dates set for Dec 2-5.

•  CONTEXT: Equity issuance by electric utilities is rare, as they typically rely on corporate bonds for
financing. The last significant case of a utility issuing public equity was Tokyo Electric’s ¥446.9
billion issuance in 2010, prior to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. KEPCO’s planned
fundraising will surpass this.
• TAKEAWAY: For most of the last decade and a half, power utilities in Japan have been a poor investment. As a

company highly reliant on NPPs, KEPCO has faced a public backlash both in the aftermath of the Fukushima
accident and due to a bribery scandal involving top management and nuclear facilities. Still, in September
2023 KEPCO’s shares finally recovered to the level prior to the March 2011 Fukushima accident. Despite a
recent selloff, the utility and its peers are starting to draw investor interest again largely due to the belief that
new construction of data centers and other IT infrastructure will require more clean electricity. KEPCO is trying
to capitalize on the investor interest now before the market trend inevitably changes.

(Company statement, Nov 12)
•  On Nov 9 at 20:22, there was a wide-area power outage affecting up to 365,300 households in the

Shikoku area; the issue was resolved at 21:49.
•  The cause was an operational error in the balancing system on the DC interconnection line with the
Kansai area due to a difference in understanding between Shikoku Electric and Kansai Electric
while working on the supply-demand balance.
•  The frequency dropped sharply due to a decrease in the supply capacity in Shikoku caused by a
sudden increase in the power flow to Kansai; the supply-demand balance maintenance device was
activated, and transmission was stopped.

•  CONTEXT: Shikoku has two interconnection lines with Honshu. The Chugoku area side is the
Honshu-Shikoku Interconnection Line connecting Kagawa and Okayama, and has two AC lines.

JAPC hopes to reapply for Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 restart
(Nikkei, Nov 13)
•  Japan Atomic Power Company aims to reapply for restart of its Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 in Fukui Pref.
This follows the NRA’s rejection of the plant’s restart application.
•  The NRA cited the possible presence of an active fault beneath the reactor. JAPC will make extra

geological surveys based on external expert opinions.
•  CONTEXT: At the end of August, the NRA denied the restart of Tsuruga Unit 2. This was the first
such denial since the NRA was created in 2012. The NRA cited the presence of a K fault line near
the NPP, as well as the possible connection of the fault with yet another one.
• TAKEAWAY: JAPC’s efforts are widely seen to be in vain. Given the presence of multiple fault lines in the area,
the chances of a restart are unlikely. But the company has only two NPPs and both face restart issues.

Japan’s gas prices becoming more correlated with Europe’s TTF benchmark
(Japan NRG, Nov 13)
•  The TTF-Northeast Asia spot gas prices have steadily become more correlated in recent years, with

the current level at about 80%, says Argus Media. The correlation is partly based on European gas
stockpile levels.
•  Meanwhile, the TTF forward curve for summer-inter price spreads is in steep “backwardation”,
which has only intensified this month. So far this year, there’s been a strong rebound in LNG
demand, which has outpaced supply growth.
•  CONTEXT: “Backwardation” refers to the situation in which current prices for an asset are higher

than those in the futures market. That suggests demand for an asset today supersedes interest in
the commodity in the coming months. A wave of new U.S. LNG production capacity is due online
starting Q2 of 2025.
•  Argus also forecasts a boost in associated gas supply from the U.S. as a result of expectedly pro-oil
policies by incoming President Trump. U.S. shale growth could enter into a “new paradigm”.
•  Stronger U.S. oil and gas output is likely to cause a shift in global attention from the Brent crude
benchmark to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark.



Mitsubishi and Mitsui expand LNG production as power demand rises

(Nikkei, Nov 13)
•  Japanese companies are expanding LNG production to meet rising power demand, viewing LNG
as a cleaner alternative to coal.
•  Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co are leading the increase in investments. Mitsubishi is expanding
its share in Malaysia's LNG projects, and is ready to launch the “LNG Canada” on that country’s
west coast. Mitsui is investing in a UAE LNG project.
•  CONTEXT: Global LNG production will likely increase from 474 Mt in early 2024, to 667 Mt by

2028. There’ll be major growth in supply from the U.S. and Qatar.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
U.S. might sanction Gazprombank, could impact Japan's LNG imports
(Nikkei, Nov 15)
o  The U.S. is considering more sanctions on Russia, prohibiting transactions between
Gazprombank and U.S. banks.

o  Gazprombank facilitates payments for Sakhalin-2. Although the G7 has strict sanctions on
Russia's top banks, there’s no ban on transactions for natural gas.
o  CONTEXT: Mitsui and Mitsuishi Corp own stakes in Sakhalin-2, which supplies roughly
10% of Japan's LNG imports. Japanese companies often rely on U.S. banks for
transactions when purchasing Russian LNG.

Saudi Aramco notifies Japan’s LPG distributors of rising export prices
(Nikkei, Nov 12)
•  Saudi Aramco notified Japan’s LPG distributors that it will raise the export prices for LPG
shipments. This regards shipments scheduled for November, marking the fourth consecutive

month of increase.
•  The price rise is due to heightened crude oil prices driven by Middle East tensions, along with the
onset of peak LPG demand season.
•  For propane, used in heating and water heating, the price was set at $635 per ton, up $10 (2%)
from the previous month. Butane, used as a petrochemical feedstock, was also raised by $10 (2%)
to $630 per ton.
•  CONTEXT: Since LPG is a byproduct of crude oil production, it’s susceptible to fluctuations in

crude oil prices. WTI crude oil futures reached a two-month high in early Oct at $78 per barrel. This
was due to supply concerns after Israel initiated ground attacks in Lebanon. Winter demand for
LPG in East Asia will increase. Last year, prices also rose until November.



LNG stocks up from last week, up over the five-year average
(Government data, Nov 13)
•  As of Nov 10, LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 2.21 million tons, a 4.3% rise from the previous
week (2.12 million tons); and up 2.3% from end November 2023 (2.16 million tons). It’s also 3.8%

up from the 5-year average of 2.13 million tons.
•  CONTEXT: Utility companies are restocking LNG in preparation for colder weather, but Tokyo
recently enjoyed 20 degree Celsius temperature. Last week, Mt. Fuji saw its first snow cap this
year, the latest date on record.

Direct Ocean Capture: Can CCS Go Green?

The challenge of capturing CO2 in a fully sustainable manner is pushing researchers
and companies to be more creative and embrace different approaches. One solution
is direct ocean capture (DOC) developed by the California-based startup Captura,
which has support from important Japanese investors.

Captura’s technology was presented by the company’s CEO Steve Oldham at Smart
Energy Week in Tokyo on October 2. Captura is as green as carbon capture can
possibly be, which sets it apart from other CCS methods that are often criticized by
environmental groups for being too aligned with the interests of the oil and gas
industry.

In brief, Captura’s system amplifies the ocean’s natural role as a carbon sink, since the
ocean can naturally capture CO2 from the air. This feature could make Captura an
interesting environmental solution for decarbonization, and it would be far less costly
and complex than current systems.

While Captura appears to be solidly ‘green’, it’s still a CO2 capture and storage
technology that aims to alleviate industrial emissions and not prevent them entirely.
Thus, it faces many of the same challenges associated with the still-underdeveloped
CCS industry in general.


The technology
Research shows that the ocean naturally captures about one-third of the CO2 emitted
into the atmosphere. Still, as atmospheric CO2 levels have increased in recent
decades, the safe levels that the ocean can absorb are reaching a critical point; for
example, rising carbon levels increase seawater acidification and other detrimental
impacts.

How does Captura’s DOC tech work? It diverts a small part of the seawater pumped
through its system, taking the salt water, sodium chloride, hydrogen and oxygen, and
reassembling them as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. The acid is introduced
into the seawater, causing a reaction that releases dissolved CO2, which is then
captured.

After the CO2 removal, alkali is added to the seawater to counteract increased acidity
from the previous step. Finally, the resulting seawater mixture is returned to the
ocean. Once the CO2 is removed from the water, the ocean absorbs more carbon
from the atmosphere to maintain equilibrium between the gas dissolved in the liquid
and the one above the liquid.

DOC operates using seawater, renewable electricity, a proprietary membrane and
electrodialysis technology. According to Captura, around 70% of the total energy
consumed by the system owes to electrodialysis, which operates only for a few hours a
day. Captura believes it can work well with renewables, using facilities during the day
when energy production is higher than grid demand.

Once captured, a possible final destination for CO2 is storage through geologic
sequestration, but it can also be reused to create sustainable products and fuels. In
particular, the system offers opportunities for sectors like aviation and shipping.

Plants and functions
The first DOC pilot was installed at Caltech’s Kerckhoff Marine, launching in 2022. It
removed one ton of CO2 per year. The second-generation system launched in 2023,
and is located at the AltaSea marine research facility in the Port of Los Angeles, having
a capacity to remove 100 tons per year. A third pilot, capable of capturing 1,000 tons
per year, is under construction in Hawaii, in partnership with Equinor. Operations are
slated to start in 2025. Captura also recently announced pilot plants in Quebec and
Norway.


The system will be deployed utilizing desalination plants and utilities that use
seawater for cooling, aiming to capture up to 10,000 tons of CO2 per year, per site.
Inactive oil and gas platforms can also be used, and would accommodate up to 1
Mtpa of CO2, per site. Both these options lower costs and protect the environment,
without any need to build new infrastructure.

Captura says the technology has no harmful byproducts and, even if deployed at a
gigaton scale, it won’t damage the marine environment. Possibly it could benefit the
ocean: after CO2 removal, the water is less acidic than that of untreated seawater.

With a diversified portfolio of investors, including Japan Airlines and Hitachi, Captura
raised $45.3 million in its Series A round. Full operations are set to come online by
2026, with plans to license the technology and form JVs with partners.

The global aviation industry has strict decarbonization targets, and the International
Air Transportation Association (IATA) sees CO2 capture and SAF as clean fuel
solutions. IATA said that the industry plans to prevent as much as 1,100 Mtpa of CO2
by utilizing SAF, and up to 500 Mtpa with the help of CO2 removal.

In March, Japan Airlines invested in Captura through its Innovation Fund, along with
Nationalgrid; Captura raised around $10 million. JAL’s innovation fund was launched
in 2019 with a total capital of $70 million. It now has a portfolio of 12 startups, in three
areas: mobility, digital and sustainability.

Competitors: DAC and other DOC systems
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), achieving net zero will require the
recovery of a total of about 1 billion tons of CO2 by 2050. Direct air capture (DAC) is
currently the leading method of recovery, but still in its infancy. In principle, DOC is
similar to DAC. Yet, ocean water has a CO2 concentration that’s about 150% higher
volumetrically than the atmosphere.

Since DOC requires less energy to sequester the same amount of CO2, Captura
expects the costs to be 50% less than DAC. Other contributing factors include the
technology's deployability, limiting the majority of its energy intake to just a few hours
a day, and the absence of sorbents used in the process.

The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) is also
developing a DOC technology. But, unlike Captura, it plans to recover CO2 using a
system like DAC paired with renewable energy (namely, wind).


JAMSTEC aims to start prototype experiments in 2025 and hopes to commercialize
the technology around 2040, but it faces challenges regarding cost, which are
currently higher than recovery from the atmosphere.

Globally, Captura’s three main competitors are Brineworks, Sea02, and Ebb Carbon.
Brineworks, based in Amsterdam, utilizes electrolysis to separate CO2. It is also
producing hydrogen as a by-product, which could become an extra revenue stream.
Sea02, a Delft University spin-off, employs electrodialysis (like Captura), and it seeks
partnerships for CO2 sequestration in Europe, aiming to scale its carbon removal by
2045. Ebb Carbon’s approach targets facilities processing seawater. It creates an
alkaline solution that, when returned to the ocean, binds CO2 as bicarbonate, a long-
term storage form. This way, it also helps combat ocean acidification, benefiting
marine ecosystems.

Conclusion
Captura’s DOC technology positions itself as the greenest form of CCS available
utilizing ocean water – something that is abundant on the planet and readily available.
Yet, the notion that CO2 storage should be underground has already become
ingrained in the minds of many in this sector.

Meanwhile, CCS has many capable critics who raise doubts on the effectiveness of this
approach in reducing emissions, as well as its safety. The critics may not be swayed by
Captura’s DOC technology no matter how much of an improvement it purports to be
on regular DAC facilities. This also means that investors interested in going green will
likely prefer established and less controversial technologies for CO2 storage.

To meet tangible CO2 reducing emission goals, Captura plans to deploy DOC on a
scale ten times larger than the pilot’s current 1,000 tons per year. But sufficient
funding is needed, either from industries interested in receiving carbon credits or from
companies eager to use CO2-derived products.

Using DOC for SAF offers hope that this technology might find use in industry and
prove viable over the long term. Still, SAF itself is still far from being widely accepted
and utilized, and faces its own uphill battles in solving technological and production
challenges.


While new technologies often contain the vision needed to shape tomorrow’s world,
such innovations inevitably run-up against the realities of market forces. State
subsidies can help get a technology off the ground, but long-term viability requires
economic sense, and DOC technology still has to prove itself.

Kansai Airports, KHI and Airbus Prepare for Hydrogen Flight

As Japan prepares to launch trillions-of-yen in subsidies to support companies in
building domestic hydrogen infrastructure, one interest group with an eye on the prize
will likely be airports and the aviation sector.

Moves to shift some operations at Japanese airports away from fossil fuels and to
hydrogen, as well as other clean energy sources, have been in motion for several
years already. Several hubs are trialing hydrogen fuel cell support and cargo loading
vehicles, such as forklifts.

The bigger revolution, however, is expected to come in the 2030s when aircraft
themselves enter the hydrogen age. And three of the top airports in the Kansai area
have now teamed up with Airbus, the world’s largest aerospace firm, to plan how to
adapt to hydrogen-fueled air travel.

In part, Kansai International Airport (KIX), Osaka International Airport and Kobe
Airport are simply following a global trend in their sector to build out the necessary
infrastructure to support commercial hydrogen flight. However, the Kansai group also
includes hydrogen engineering specialist Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), which has a
history of success in both advancing new technologies for hydrogen handling and
storage, as well as securing state grants.


Japan NRG reviews the airport project specifications and state of development.

Lighter than air

clear that the solutions favored by, say, passenger road transport, may not apply as
well to marine and air travel. The much-touted electrification push for cars will be hard
to replicate when it comes to aircraft, and so many in the aviation field have turned to
options including hydrogen.

In theory, hydrogen is appealing because it has about 2.8 times the energy density of
crude oil-based aviation fuel by mass and can potentially be produced via renewables
at or near airports. But challenges remain. Although less liquid hydrogen fuel mass is
needed to achieve the same power, the difficulties of storing this alternative means
that a hydrogen aircraft’s combined fuel and tank weight would be greater than that
of today’s planes.

Still, the top airports in the Kansai region have joined the ranks of peers internationally
that believe that the technical hurdle might just be overcome, paving the way for
hydrogen-powered commercial air travel by the mid-2030s.

KIX, Osaka International and Kobe airports have agreed to join Airbus’ global
“Hydrogen Hub at Airports” program and build upon their work with the aerospace
company in 2022 to begin a more detailed feasibility study of creating the necessary
infrastructure to enable hydrogen flight.

The three airports were all early movers with hydrogen, signing up for the transport
ministry’s “Basic Policy for Promotion of Decarbonization of Aviation” program that
started in 2022 with the goal of mapping a roadway for carbon neutral aviation by
mid-century. KIX and Osaka International’s decarbonization plans were certified by the
ministry (MLIT) as part of the first cohort on December 1, 2023, with Kobe Airport
attaining certification on July 31.

KIX’s hydrogen infrastructure is currently the most mature. It has two supply stations
serving three FC cars, 21 FC forklifts, and a number of other FC forklifts owned by
separate companies that work at the airport. In 2022, a subsidy program from the
Ministry of the Environment and Osaka Prefecture helped launch an FC shuttle bus
that runs between KIX and Osaka International, where there is one hydrogen supply
station and several FC vehicles.

Future hydrogen supply chain hubs
While hydrogen infrastructure has not yet been introduced at Kobe Airport proper, a
Kawasaki Heavy-led demo project has built a liquified hydrogen supply chain terminal
on the airport island in the Port of Kobe, which received its first shipment in 2022.

According to Airbus, that’s good groundwork for exploring the feasibility of turning
the airports into future hydrogen supply chain hubs. Airbus, the three Kansai airports,
and KHI have signed an MoU to pursue conducting a feasibility study on this topic.


Japan’s latest iteration of the Basic Hydrogen Strategy, released in June 2023,
estimates that ¥15 trillion ($97 billion) in public and private investments into hydrogen
supply chains are required over the next 15 years. The government will only cover a
fraction of the amount.

A new Contract for Difference subsidies plan, to launch this month or in early
December, will offer as much as ¥3 trillion for domestic supply chains (i.e. distributors
and end users) that want to switch to hydrogen or ammonia without losing out

economically. Money will also be made available for those embarking on hydrogen
infrastructure construction.

Since 2017, Airbus has had an agreement with METI to cooperate on the
development of a local aviation ecosystem, and the two sides met in summer 2023 to
align on decarbonization. This collaboration translates more readily into real-life
support since two of the Kansai airports involved with Airbus, KIX and Osaka
International, are run by the government-funded New Kansai International Airport Co.
Further state support seems implicit when reviewing why the Kansai airports joined
Airbus’ Hydrogen Hubs at Airports program.

Airbus has already carried out a liquified hydrogen demand forecast for Kansai
Airports, and anticipates a few tons of hydrogen fuel per day will be needed to
support hydrogen aircraft “in the early stages of introduction”, meaning 2035 and
shortly thereafter.

The plans will incorporate technology tested by Airbus’ four hydrogen-fueled ZEROe
concept planes. The ZEROe models were designed in 2020 and can carry 100-200
passengers or less on flights of up to 1,000 to 2,000 nautical miles. Around 2050,
Airbus anticipates that several hundred tons of hydrogen fuel will be needed each day
across the three airports.
























Kawasaki’s hydrogen experience
While Airbus focuses on the demand of new hydrogen-fueled planes, it falls to KHI to
consider the airport support infrastructure, which will require overcoming engineering
challenges around how to move and store liquid hydrogen in fuel form.

KHI has made several breakthroughs with liquid hydrogen. In 2022, its Suiso Frontier -
the world’s first liquefied hydrogen carrier - made its maiden international voyage to
Australia, where it loaded 1,250 cubic meters of liquified hydrogen before returning to
Kobe Airport Island. In addition to a 2,250 cubic-meter liquefied hydrogen tank built
on Kobe Airport Island in 2020, KHI has a design for a 10,000 cubic meter tank at the
site, which would be the largest in the world if and when built.

KHI has also been instrumental in developing a Loading Arm System (LAS) to connect
liquified hydrogen ships with terminals. For these technologies, the company leaned
on its decades of experience with LNG.

Much of Kawasaki Heavy’s R&D into liquid hydrogen handling has benefited from
government support. On May 31, the company was awarded three of the first ten
Hydrogen Society Promotion Act grants for three separate hydrogen feasibility
studies.

How about on-site production?
Of course, the most efficient way to utilize hydrogen in aviation would be for airports
to produce at least some of the fuel onsite, especially since renewable energy can be
deployed to power electrolyzers that split water into its oxygen and hydrogen
components.

The idea isn’t entirely far-fetched. KIX is currently building a 23.8 MW solar farm
adjacent to its Terminal 2 that will be used partly to power electrolysis. Due to come
online in spring 2025, KIX hasn’t said how much of the facility will generate electricity
for use as is, and how much will be devoted to electrolyzers.


A comparable installation is the 10 MW Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field,
which was the world’s largest green hydrogen production facility when it opened in
2020. It can produce up to 1,200 Nm3 of hydrogen per hour from 20 MW of onsite
solar capacity. KIX should be able to generate similar volumes, which would be about
110 kg of H2 an hour.

According to BMW, a fuel cell car can travel 100 kilometers on one kilo of hydrogen.
But the volumes required for a busy airport are many times greater. Meanwhile, there
is a limit on the space that airports can dedicate to solar or other renewables facilities.

This is where Airbus and the Japanese consortium parties will need to get creative
and find solutions. Roadmaps for commercial hydrogen aviation suggest that those
solutions will need to arrive this decade.

COP29    WRAP-UP

BY JOHN VAROLI

This week and next, the column will focus on major developments at COP29 in Baku.
Here are some of the main stories.

1. Voluntary transition credits could help finance the phase-out of coal-fired
power plants in Asia, but familiar risks over project permanence and buyer
appetite are seen as major barriers to scaling up such credits, concluded a
COP29 panel discussion.

2. Paul Everingham, CEO of the Asia Natural Gas & Energy Association, said
much of Asia uses coal because it’s familiar and inexpensive. He said that
natural gas is the logical choice as a much cleaner burning alternative to coal.
3. A secret recording shows the head of Azerbaijan's COP29 team, Elnur
Soltanov, discussing "investment opportunities" in that country’s state oil and
gas company with a man posing as a potential investor. "We have a lot of gas
fields that are to be developed," Soltanov says, reported the BBC.

4. The Argentinian delegation withdrew from COP29 on the orders of President
Javier Milei, who is cultivating a friendship with U.S. President-elect Donald
Trump, whose own climate and energy stances need no special introduction.

5. French Ecology Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher pulled out of COP29 after
Azerbaijan’s President Aliyev accused France of carrying out colonialist crimes
in New Caledonia. Since May, a crackdown by French police has killed 13
people and left 169 wounded during protests by indigenous people.

6. The World Bank and other international development banks announced that
they were on track to provide $120 billion per year for low-income and
middle-income countries by 2030, up from $74.7 billion last year.
7. China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in
emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the UK and
U.S. had the biggest decreases in emissions.

8. Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of GHGs, all of
them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth, according to data from an
NGO co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and released at
COP29.

9. The world’s most polluting cities are: Shanghai, 256 MMT of GHGs; Tokyo,
250 MMT; New York City, 160 MMT; Houston, 150 MMT; and Seoul, 142
MMT.

10. COP29 negotiators are expected to wrap up the conference on Nov 22.
Climate financing will be the key issue, which could be in the range of $300
billion annually. The larger figure could be $1 trillion a year and would include
both international institutional funding, as well as hundreds of billions of
private sector funds.
