NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


ANRE presents approach for next-gen geothermal energy roadmap

(Government statement, July 15)
•  ANRE stated its intention to draw up a roadmap for next-gen geothermal. The govt plans to hammer
out a roadmap by October, followed by approval via the Subcommittee on Resources and Fuel.
•  The targeted cost for next-gen geothermal power should be at a level equivalent to or lower than
conventional geothermal, or within the range of ¥12-19/ kWh.
•  While the potential for conventional geothermal capacity in Japan is estimated at 23.5 GW, in
theory, with next-gen geothermal it could be 77 GW.
•  The estimated economic impact of next-gen geothermal, assuming development of even 10% of its
potential (7.7 GW), is about ¥29 to ¥46 trillion.
•  CONTEXT: To expand geothermal power, in April, ANRE launched the “Council for Next-Generation
Geothermal” to facilitate discussions between public and private sectors and to develop a roadmap. Next-
gen geothermal refers to tech that overcomes the limitations of conventional geothermal power and is
both more efficient and environmentally friendly. These technologies include “supercritical geothermal,”
“closed-loop systems,” and “EGS (Enhanced Geothermal Systems).”



New research vessel planned to boost deep-sea rare earth exploration
(Asia Nikkei, July 16)
•  Japan will build a new research support ship carrying multiple deep-sea probes, including crewed
submersibles such as the Shinkai 6500, reducing voyage durations.
•  The new ship will lower research costs and manpower by enabling stationary surface observations
and supporting autonomous vehicles.
•  The existing 35-year-old research vessel Yokosuka can carry only one probe.
•  CONTEXT: Japan aims to begin rare-earth mining by FY2028, tapping an estimated 16 Mt near
Minamitorishima, to decrease dependence on China, which controls 70% of global rare earth
production.
• TAKEAWAY: Japanese media increasingly discuss deep-sea or seabed mining. For example, pilot mining of rare
earth minerals from seabed mud near Minami-Torishima Island, 1,950 km southeast of Tokyo, would start in
January 2026 and a larger trial would kick off a year later. The ambition to turn this entirely new form of
mining into a near-commercial venture by 2028 seems overly optimistic, but we believe it could be possible to
see moderate quantities of minerals mined on a consistent basis from the end of this decade. Japan’s seabed is

known to hold nickel and cobalt ores, as well as rare-earth elements. JOGMEC is the main state entity involved
in searching and mining such elements.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Cobalt price hikes likely to affect battery manufacturers
(Nikkei, July 17)
o  Cobalt prices, critical for EV batteries, are rising sharply due to a supply halt by the world’s
top producer, the Democratic Republic of Congo, which supplies over 70% of cobalt
globally.
o  CONTEXT: Cobalt-free, lower-cost LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries are popular in
China, drawing interest from Japanese automakers and battery manufacturers seeking to
reduce costs and supply chain risks.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan imported some 7,000 tons of cobalt in 2023, with over 60% used in rechargeable batteries,
including those for EVs and electronics. As cobalt prices have risen by about 50% since early 2025,

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

manufacturers face mounting cost pressures and growing supply chain risks. The continued surge in cobalt
prices could accelerate Japan's transition toward cobalt-free technologies, such as LFP batteries, which are
cheaper and increasingly adopted globally. It could even reshape Japan’s EV battery strategy, prompting more
investment in alternative chemistries and domestic battery innovation to reduce imports.



MODEC  and Norway’s Eld Energy to install offshore fuel cell pilot
(Company statement, July 16)
•  Mitsui Ocean Development & Engineering (MODEC) inked a deal with Norway’s Eld Energy to
design and make a 40 kW solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) pilot plant.
•  The system will be installed aboard one of MODEC’s floating production storage and offloading
(FPSO) vessels operating offshore.
•  CONTEXT: SOFCs offer higher efficiency and lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional combustion-
based systems and can use fuels other than hydrogen due to their high operating temperature. The goal
is to develop multi-MW power plants able to replace gas turbines offshore by 2030.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hitachi develops next-gen SOFC tech
(Company statement, July 10)
o  Hitachi has developed a next-gen solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with high power output at

low temperatures.
o  It claims to reduce the number of thermal insulation components required, lowering costs,
while offering broad application potential in industrial and portable power sources, from
factory in-house generation to disaster-response supplies.
o  CONTEXT: This tech applies Hitachi’s expertise in semiconductors to make each fuel cell layer
from separately-manageable partitioned cells, enabling evaluation of each cell and elimination
of defective ones, reducing failure risk.



Power retailer Groove Energy fails again to settle overdue fees
(Government statement, July 11)
•  METI said power retailer Groove Energy failed to pay the renewable energy surcharge by the June
30 deadline and also ignored a follow-up notice due by July 10.
•  METI says the firm has been in default on surcharge payments since Dec 2024.
•  CONTEXT: Groove Energy operates in retail power, energy system planning, and sales of residential
energy equipment. The firm positions itself as a next-gen energy provider in the deregulated power
market.

GX-ETS: benchmarking for power sector will aim for balance, says METI
(Denki Shimbun, July 17)
•  Ito Sadanori, head of the GX Group at METI, said the GX-ETS will adopt a balanced approach when
setting benchmarks for the power sector. It won't highlight "winners and losers" among companies.


4



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Starting FY2026, the GX-ETS will ask companies emitting over 100,000 tons of CO2 a year to join.
The govt will divide free emission allowances among power companies based on benchmarks
aligned with reduction targets.
•  Ito is concerned about a possible “double burden” that could happen when both paid emissions
auctions (from FY2033) and fossil fuel surcharges (from FY2028) launch. He said there’ll be
adjustments to avoid charging for the same carbon twice.



KEPCO Nanko Power Plant: all units to begin operation in FY2030

•  The aim is to optimize energy use, reduce carbon emissions, and cut electricity costs by using solar
power and stored EV energy during peak hours.
•  CONTEXT: Higashihiroshima City and Hiroshima Univ seek to promote regional revitalization and
development by combining the city’s resources with the university’s research strengths under the Town &
Gown concept.



Hokkaido and Kansai utilities ink pumped storage deal to secure grid capacity
(Company statement, July 11)
•  Hokkaido Electric Power Network and Kansai T&D inked contracts to directly procure adjustment
capacity from pumped storage power plants.
•  Both units overseeing power transmission and distribution are affiliated, respectively, with
Hokkaido Electric and KEPCO.
•  The deals covering 340 MW and 470 MW, respectively, run through March 2026 and aim to

JBIC inks $626 million loan for U.S. low-carbon ammonia project
(Company statement, July 1)
•  JBIC inked a loan co-financed with Mitsui & Co for up to $626 million to Blue Point Number One, a
Louisiana firm, to support its low-carbon ammonia production.
•  This loan will be implemented as a syndicated loan with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, with the
total syndicated loan amount at around $1.04 billion.
•  The money will finance trading house Mitsui's investment in Blue Point Number One, LLC as part of
the government’s strategy to support the building of a global hydrogen supply chain.
•  The project will utilize CCS to reduce emissions by over 95% during production. Mitsui will buy a
portion of the low-carbon ammonia and supply it to Japan’s power and chemical sectors.
•  CONTEXT: The financing is separate from a Contract for Difference (CfD) subsidy scheme set up to

support the demand side in Japan. Results of the CfD are expected within this year.



FDK develops alloy for hydrogen storage tanks
(Company statement, July 17)
•  FDK developed an alloy as a new material in hydrogen storage tanks. Sample provision began this
month, with mass production planned starting October.
•  While AB5-type alloys (made of rare earth metals and transition metals such as LaNi₅) have been
used in nickel-metal hydride batteries, the new product is an AB2-type alloy (combinations of
transition metals such as ZrV₂ or TiMn₂).
•  AB2-type alloys are more suitable for hydrogen tanks as they use lighter materials, have a higher
hydrogen storage capacity, and consist of cost-effective elements.
•  CONTEXT: FDK has produced and sold nickel-metal hydride batteries since 1991. Hydrogen storage
alloys are used in the negative electrodes of nickel-metal hydride batteries. These alloys offer a
volumetric hydrogen storage efficiency about twice that of liquid hydrogen and seven times that of
compressed hydrogen gas. Because these alloys can stably store hydrogen at near room temperature and
atmospheric pressure, FDK has been developing them for use in hydrogen storage tanks.
• TAKEAWAY: Currently, the main methods for hydrogen storage are high-pressure gas, liquefied hydrogen, and
liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). But, hydrogen storage alloys were once considered a prominent
storage method because they offer advantages in safety and transportability. Issues remain regarding weight,
cost, absorption/ desorption rates, and storage capacity.

Tokyo Gas to study building high-pressure hydrogen pipeline
(Company statement, July 15)
•  The Tokyo Metro Govt selected Tokyo Gas to develop a hydrogen pipeline covering the airport
waterfront area, to be implemented in three stages:
o  Stage 1: Create hydrogen demand points through applications such as hydrogen boilers,
mobility, industrial use, and hydrogen stations.
o  Stage 2: Expand hydrogen demand at those points by generating additional surrounding
demand and involving various business operators.
o  Stage 3: Establish a hydrogen supply system by connecting the hydrogen demand points
from Stage 2 with pipelines and other infrastructure.
•  This marks the first initiative to consider the construction of high-pressure hydrogen pipelines in the
Tokyo metropolitan area.
•  CONTEXT: In April 2024, the TMG set up the “Tokyo Hydrogen Supply System Council Including

Pipelines” to expand hydrogen demand and future imports of the energy source.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is in the early stages of commercializing hydrogen pipelines, with demo projects and
conceptual planning under way. Pipelines are usually the cheapest means of transport for large volumes of gas
or liquid, and would be ideal to move hydrogen from production point or import terminal to demand centers.
However, hydrogen causes embrittlement in some metals, making them brittle and prone to cracking, especially
at high pressures. This is a concern for pipelines used to transport hydrogen, as it can lead to failures. New
alloys are required to make the pipelines suitable for long-term hydrogen transportation.

NEWS:    NUCLEAR      ENERGY



KEPCO plans to build a new NPP at Mihama site
(Nikkei, July 18)
•  KEPCO will push forward with plans to build a new nuclear power plant at the site of Mihama NPP
in Fukui Pref, starting with community outreach next week.
•  This is the first time a major power company has specifically discussed building new nuclear power
plants in Japan since the Fukushima disaster in March 2011.
•  KEPCO will soon begin geological and environmental surveys on the site and plans to inform local
authorities next week. This move revives plans first started in 2010 but halted after the Fukushima

accident.
•  The planned NPP will use an advanced light-water reactor (ALWR) design, and is estimated to
require 20 years from the survey stage to operation, including regulatory reviews and approvals.
•  CONTEXT: Mihama Unit 3 is operational; the older Units 1 and 2 at the site are being decommissioned.
The NRA approved an extension of Unit 3’s operational life until 2036 (when it will mark 60 years of
operation).

• TAKEAWAY: KEPCO sees replacing aging reactors (like Mihama-3 that will hit 50 years in 2026) as crucial for
energy stability. Extension of Mihama-3 is a short-to-medium-term solution only. The long-term strategy clearly
includes new builds. The utility plans an entirely new NPP on the Mihama site, but not at Unit 3’s exact location.
The govt energy strategy requires new NPPs to be built to keep nuclear’s 20% share in the country's energy mix.
It’s also telling that the utility leaked the news to Japan’s largely pro-nuclear business newspaper, the Nikkei, on
Friday evening ahead of a three-day weekend during which there is also a national upper-house election.
Clearly, the nuclear sector is still concerned about a public pushback. Another issue that KEPCO will need to
navigate is what to do with storage of spent nuclear fuel. The ‘final’ solution for that is not yet available in
Japan, and yet the utility will undoubtedly be asked about its plans during the consultation process. As KEPCO
indicated in the Nikkei article, the entire process will take a couple of decades so there is time for the issues to
be ironed out. Still, KEPCO and other nuclear utilities will need more active support from the national
government – not least in terms of financing and power rate plans – if they are to make good on the national
target of keeping nuclear energy at 20% of the electricity mix going forward.



Japan launches platform to speed up use of ATF

(Denki Shimbun, July 18)
•  Japan launched a platform to promote the practical use of Advanced Technology Fuel (ATF), uniting
academia, industry, and govt agencies to discuss technical issues.
•  All relevant Japanese organizations, such as METI and NRA, have already joined. The Japan Atomic
Energy Agency serves as the secretariat.
•  The platform has four sub-working groups, with a strong focus on chromium-coated cladding for
PWRs, Japan's most advanced area of research.
•  CONTEXT: Usually, "ATF" refers to Accident Tolerant Fuel. But the platform adopts the broader
interpretation of Advanced Technology Fuel, to refer to a new class of nuclear fuel designed to improve
safety in nuclear reactors. Reflecting this trend, the platform uses “new-type fuel” as its official name.

NEWS:    CARBON      CAPTURE      & SYNTHETIC       FUELS


Up to $1 billion worth of carbon credits needed for Japan’s ETS

(Nikkei, July 18)
•  BloombergNEF released a report on Japan's emissions trading system, to be implemented in
FY2026, estimating a need for up to $1 billion (about ¥150 billion) worth of carbon credits. Current
credit supply is insufficient, so further investment in renewable energy is necessary, according to the
report.
•  Under the planned ETS system, companies emitting over 100,000 tons of CO2 per year will be
subject to emission caps. If they exceed these limits, they must offset the excess by purchasing
credits or allowances from companies with a surplus.
•  The govt will allow carbon credits to cover up to 10% of emissions. Based on this limit,
BloombergNEF says demand for carbon credits will rise to 54 Mt by 2030, possibly costing up to $1
billion, depending on carbon prices.



NEDO's GIF projects look to ¥2,000/ ton as CCUS cost target
(Japan NRG, July 18)
•  New low carbon technology projects sponsored by NEDO aim for CCUS costs of ¥2,000/ ton,
according to a number of presentations made at the reporting day for Green Innovation Fund
backed projects in Yokohama.
•  Most sessions focused on hydrogen / ammonia, CCUS, geothermal and biomass, followed by solar
and then wind power tech.
•  Other technologies that took center stage at the event were floating wind turbines and innovations
related to perovskite solar cells.
•  CONTEXT: The ¥2,000 per ton (about $20 USD) target is for the cost of separating and capturing CO2,
not the full CCUS process including transportation and storage. The Green Innovation Fund was

established in 2021 to distribute ¥2 trillion in subsidies for R&D into clean energy technologies. Most
projects are expected to develop technology that's commercially viable by 2030.


METI opens subsidy projects for decarbonization of coastal shipping

•  The program offers up to a 50% subsidy for capital and implementation costs of pilot projects,
combining hardware measures like energy-efficient hulls, propellers, and engines, and software
measures like optimizing operations and fleet planning.
•  CONTEXT: The 7th Basic Energy Plan released earlier this year raised the 2030 emissions reduction
target for the domestic shipping sector from 480,000 kl in crude oil equivalent to 620,000 kl.



KHI begins building CO2 capture demo facility

Major Utilities Adjust Investment Plans to Chime With New National Goals
In February, the Cabinet approved three sweeping energy and climate initiatives: the 7th
Basic Energy Plan, the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures, and the GX 2040
Vision. Since then, major power utilities and gas companies have outlined their yearly,
short-term, or medium-term business management plans, offering the first insights into
how Japan’s energy industry is responding to the new goals.

While nearly every company reaffirmed a commitment to a low-carbon future, the
degree of scale, scope, and choice of technologies varies significantly. Beyond a few
standouts, most plan to keep thermal power as a critical part of the generation mix.

By far the biggest trend among the nation’s biggest energy firms was a re-commitment
to embrace LNG as a replacement for coal, as well as support for co-firing ammonia and
hydrogen fuels and the long-term implementation of CCS technologies as the pathways
to reduce thermal power’s carbon footprint.
Still, the utilities’ decarbonization plans differed in the extent to which thermal power
would remain and the “complementary” thermal-related decarbonization measures. The
stance on expanding renewables was also far from unanimous.

Bolstering renewables infrastructure
The government’s new goals target a national energy mix of 40-50% renewables, 20%
nuclear, and 30-40% thermal power, alongside deep investments in next-generation
fuels and carbon management.

Several EPCOs have since announced additional investments to bolster renewable
energy infrastructure, such as Kyushu’s ¥1.5 trillion by 2035, Hokkaido’s ¥250 billion by
2035, and Tohoku’s ¥300 billion by 2030.
Despite the ambitious goals set by some EPCOs in response to the new national strategy,
the degree of scale varies sharply between firms. While Hokkaido, for example, plans to
generate nearly all of its electricity with renewables and nuclear by 2050, Chubu plans
to rely on thermal assets for at least half of its output in 2040, while TEPCO has not
announced any updated concrete decarbonization plans.

Of Japan’s ten major EPCOs, six have indicated specific expansion goals for renewable
energy over the next decade for a combined total of 16.4 GW by 2035. Kyushu Electric
set by far the largest goal of 10 GW by 2035, far outpacing any other EPCO, with Chubu
Electric a distant second at 3.2 GW.
No information on strategy updates from the EPCOs of Tohoku, Tokyo, Kansai, and
Okinawa was found since the publication of the 7th Basic Energy Plan.

Most major utilities defined their interest in renewable energy as limited to solar, wind,
and geothermal, while also listing nuclear as a clean energy source.

Lack of coordination
Overall, the industry isn’t poised for coordinated, fundamental change to power
generation. Every EPCO that released its plans announced an intention to transition
thermal power production to “low carbon fuels” through integrating LNG in their model
and introducing hydrogen and ammonia co-firing.

However, the specificity in plans and commitment varied. For example, Hokuriku and
Hokkaido committed to fully decarbonized thermal output by 2050, while Chubu only
described its goal as ‘heavy integration’ with low carbon fuels by 2040.

Still, the majority of utilities set 2050 as their net-zero target, in line with the current
national strategy and law.

Several EPCOs – namely Hokuriku, Hokkaido, Chubu, Kyushu, and Chugoku – also
announced a commitment to invest in CCS as a means to offset emissions from their
remaining thermal stations. However, firms that announced such intentions refrained
from setting specific targets related to implementation beyond saying that it was part of
their 2050 decarbonization strategy.
The restart of NPPs nationwide will also play a crucial role in utility decarbonization
plans. In particular, roughly half of Hokkaido Electric’s planned decarbonized energy by
2035, as per its updated plan, will be from the Tomari NPP, which has yet to restart.

In Chubu Electric’s mid-term plan, nuclear power also plays a sizable, though
significantly smaller, role by 2040. At that point, the central Japan utility expects the
bulk of its electricity to come from thermal stations running on “low carbon fuels.”
Conversely, TEPCO appears unable to fully set out decarbonization plans stemming from
the uncertainty surrounding its restart of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP.

Gas utilities’ weak efforts
Japan’s updated national energy strategy had less of an impact on the four major gas
utility companies – Tokyo, Osaka, Saibu, and Toho. The latter announced a ¥50 billion
investment in renewable energy over the next three years, aiming for an additional 500
MW of capacity by 2030.

Saibu Gas, meanwhile, plans to invest ¥100 billion over the same timeline, aiming to roll
out 130 MW of capacity. Saibu’s plan suggests that it will pay significantly more per MW
of renewables (over ¥769 million) compared to Toho (¥100 million).
These moves come as the gas industry as a whole strongly embraces the development of
LNG and supply diversification, and looks overseas – especially in Southeast Asia – for
new demand centers to absorb surplus contracted volumes from Japan.

Still, there are plenty of firms outside of the major power and gas utilities with extensive
renewable energy plans announced since the passing of the new national strategy. For
example, take the Toyota group’s trading house, Toyota Tsusho Corp. Through a series
of acquisitions in the past two-three years, Toyota has emerged as Japan’s biggest
renewable energy operator with assets at home and overseas. That momentum won’t
stop as Toyota Tsusho has business plans to invest ¥1.2 trillion in further wind, solar,
and battery developments over the next two years.
Meanwhile, solar developer Renova has committed to a ¥340 billion investment to add
another 5 GW of renewables capacity by 2030. And Kyudenko, a power infrastructure
construction business affiliated with Kyushu Electric, has announced ¥200 billion in
further green investments as it prepares to start operations at the 480 MW Ukujima solar
farm that is set to be Japan’s largest.

Conclusion
The energy sector response to the government’s updated energy strategy and CO2
reduction makes two points clear. First, there are huge discrepancies between EPCOs
and gas companies. Second, the sector’s interpretation of government strategies has
been to largely confirm the need to retain thermal assets and infrastructure as the core
energy system in Japan over the coming decades.
With the recent re-commitment to LNG, amid fuzzy timelines on integration of low
carbon fuels and CCS technologies, achieving net zero goals seems far from certain;
especially since the technologies and fuels are in an early phase of commercialization. In
fact, no CCS projects in Japan are due to start operation until 2030. The rollout of
ammonia and hydrogen co-firing is also not expected until the next decade.

All this bodes poorly for CO2 reduction planning. The degree to which new technologies
will be able to offset the utility sector’s carbon emissions will only become clear well into
the 2030s. By then, the investments planned today will already be online and part of the
nation’s energy system for decades to come.

JCM Tightens Conditions to Refocus Carbon Credits Support Scheme
The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) recently shifted gears, signaling a strategic move
away from broadly funding traditional solar power installations toward more selective
support for innovative, higher-impact technologies.

The latest auctions reveal a notable tightening of conditions, significantly limiting
support for conventional crystalline silicon-based solar projects. This underscores Japan's
intent to push technological boundaries to achieve deeper emissions cuts per
investment.

Since its inception in 2013, the JCM has successfully funded numerous solar projects
across partner countries, notably in Asia. However, as standard solar installations reach
saturation in regions like Thailand and Indonesia, Japan’s Ministry of the Environment is
keenly aware of the diminishing returns on emission reductions from repeating similar
deployments.
Since 2018, the carbon credits mechanism – which is aligned with Article 6 of the Paris
Accord – has evolved from supporting projects that upgrade local tech to cleaner
alternatives and improved energy efficiency to rewarding initiatives that involve
technology transfer and new solutions. The end goal of the JCM program, however,
remains unchanged: help Japan accumulate credits that represent a CO2 reduction of
100 million tons by 2030.
Shift to higher-impact tech
The shift in JCM’s strategy means the MoE is now prioritizing projects incorporating
newer technologies such as perovskite solar cells, hybrid storage solutions, and
advanced heat battery systems. The new direction is evident in the recent 67th round of
the JCM subsidy funding, where MinebeaMitsumi secured backing for two sizable
solar+BESS projects in Thailand. In Ayutthaya province's Bang Pa-in, the firm plans to
establish a 104 MW solar array coupled with a 129 MWh battery storage facility,
designed to power its local manufacturing plant.

Another project by the same company in Lopburi province includes a 48 MW solar
installation paired with 60 MWh of storage. These ventures reflect the ministry's support
for energy storage to enhance renewable energy's impact.
Another illustrative case from the same round is Tokyo Century’s innovative installation
at a packaging facility in Songkhla province, Thailand. Instead of simply installing solar
panels, the firm is deploying a combined solar and heat battery system. Renewables-
generated electricity will power the battery, creating stored heat energy to provide
stable steam supply to the plant day and night, significantly reducing fossil fuel usage
from conventional boilers.

Kansai Electric also secured funding for an innovative project in Indonesia, installing a
0.7 MW rooftop solar system on an automotive parts factory in Bekasi. It aims to reduce
grid dependency, utilizing solar energy for self-consumption, enhancing environmental
sustainability. Another Indonesian project, led by Tokyo Century, involves a 2.7 MW
solar system at a steel-wire products factory, again emphasizing renewable self-
consumption.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

These recent projects contrast sharply with earlier JCM rounds that predominantly
focused on standalone solar panel deployments without storage or heat utilization
components. This led to limited impact beyond immediate electricity generation. The
latest initiatives emphasize deeper integration of renewables with industrial processes
and grid stability solutions.
Looking for scale
Since its establishment over a decade ago, the JCM has been central to Japan’s
international climate strategy. Partnering now with 30 countries across Asia, Africa,
Europe, and the Americas, the Japanese government has sponsored over 265 projects.
The overwhelming majority (200+) are concentrated in Asia, especially in Thailand,
Indonesia, and Vietnam, reflecting both regional potential for emission cuts and close
economic ties. However, the scale of the projects remains moderate, with one exception
– a 400 MW solar farm in the Rabigh Region of Saudi Arabia, selected in 2020 and
operated by Marubeni.
Japan has also boosted funding for the JCM with NEDO calling for more allocation. The
total budget for JCM projects is expected to be ¥11.4 billion over a three-year period
starting in FY2025. This compares with a total of ¥6.2 billion in the six years from
FY2018 to FY2013.

Historically, JCM projects focused on straightforward renewables solutions like solar PV
arrays and small hydro facilities. Japanese officials, however, have recently tightened
eligibility criteria. For example, traditional crystalline silicon PV systems now face strict
limitations: only three such projects per partner country annually will qualify for
funding. This reduction aims to funnel resources into emerging technologies, and seeks
to create greater emissions reductions per project while supporting innovation.
As such, next-generation perovskite solar cells, despite being solar-only projects, retain
eligibility for funding. This newer solar tech, now a focus of intensive R&D globally, uses
distinctive materials and methods, promising lower cost and greater adaptability in
challenging climates and locations. Japanese firms such as Macnica are deploying
perovskite cells through JCM-backed demonstration projects in subtropical regions like
Thailand, testing their resilience against intense heat, humidity, and air pollution.

Conclusion
The refined JCM approach fits with Japan's wider policy ambitions, which aim not only
at achieving domestic climate targets but also at boosting the international
competitiveness of Japanese tech.
However, challenges accompany JCM’s pivot. Advanced technologies often entail higher
upfront investments and elevated technical risks. Ensuring these more ambitious
projects deliver on their promises will require more monitoring, validation, and support
mechanisms. The higher budget allocation to JCM seeks to partly address these
concerns.

JCM's new trajectory underscores a dual ambition: reducing GHG emissions globally
while advancing Japanese technology and competitiveness. As more pioneering projects
are selected, Japan's approach will serve as a showcase for other nations seeking to
promote their innovations in developing economies, and could lead to new standards in
international climate financing.
For those Japanese firms too conservative to implement clean tech at home, JCM offers
a cost-effective option to trial innovations overseas, booking credits for CO2 reductions
and also business efficiency gains.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Offshore wind
The developer of a proposed $10 billion Victorian offshore wind farm has abandoned the
project. Gippsland Dawn was to be a 2 GW offshore wind farm built on the Gippsland coast.
China / Crude oil
In June, China accelerated crude oil stockpiles since the strongest imports in almost two years
outweighed a rise in refinery processing. Surplus crude amounted to 1.42 mbpd in June, up
from 1.40 mbpd in May, and the fourth straight month above 1 mbpd.

China / Emissions
Surging clean power supplies have allowed utilities to reduce emissions to record lows in H1
2025 – CO2 emissions/ kWh of electricity averaged 492 grams.

China / Power
Days of record-breaking heat across the country have pushed power demand to an all-time high
in excess of 1.5 billion kilowatts on July 16.
India / Renewables
India said it achieved 50% of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources — five
years ahead of its 2030 target under the Paris Agreement.

Indonesia / Solar power
Solar PV will extend beyond replacing coal-based electricity generation; it will also include the
production of e-fuels for hard-to-abate segments, reports Lut University.

Malaysia / Coal
Malaysia is boosting coal-fired power output and importing the fuel at record levels, reports
Reuters, taking advantage of low prices even as it pledges to increase use of gas-fuelled
electricity generation in the longer term.
South Korea / Green hydrogen
YPP Corp will invest up to $3 billion in a large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production
facility in Kazakhstan.

Taiwan / Offshore wind
UK Export Finance said it will guarantee financing for Orsted's Greater Changhua 2 offshore
wind farm off the coast of Taiwan.
