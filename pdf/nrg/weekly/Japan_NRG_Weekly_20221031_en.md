NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Govt announces ¥39 trillion package including power, gas, gasoline subsidies
(Japan NRG, Oct. 28)
•  The govt announced a ¥39 trillion package to protect households and businesses from rising costs
of power, gas and gasoline, encourage new startups, attract foreign investment into Japan, and
propel speedy recovery from COVID.
•  Subsidies will offset energy cost rise from January next year.
•  Household energy spending could be cut as much as ¥45,000 next year

METI community conflicts panel criticizes solar operators, then meets criticism itself
(Japan NRG, Oct. 25)
•  Industrial associations representing solar, wind, geothermal, hydro and biomass power operators,
and officials from two municipalities presented their views to a METI panel for resolving local
conflicts while expanding renewable capacity.
•  The Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA) doesn’t support tighter regulations. Operators

should be allowed to begin generation without waiting for reviews to be completed, simply by
showing the review status. But panel members questioned this.
•  JPEA said operators often outsource tasks, from feasibility studies to plant maintenance;
contractors must be held liable for noncompliance. Panel members said the operators are
responsible to manage contractors and the contracts.
•  JPEA is opposed to making meetings with local stakeholders mandatory as they are often a

formality. If issues arise, municipalities should arbitrate.
•  CONTEXT: This was the second meeting after the Oct 17 relaunch of the community conflict panel
renamed as the Working Group to Make Renewables a Long-Term Supply Source While Coexisting
with Communities.
• TAKEAWAY: Rules need to be consistent across renewable types and locations. However, as the Japan Wind
Power Association pointed out, flexibility is required for rules that relate to geographic and climatic conditions.
The panel has the difficult task to provide guidance on delivering value to communities. See also the Analysis

section for a report on this issue.

Burned by the Sun: Learning from a Local Solar Power Conflict
“At the end of the day, it’s all about money. People weren’t getting into the solar
business because they had strong opinions on energy," says a restaurant owner in a
small town in central Japan. The owner shrugs as he explains in detail an apathetic
and sometimes hostile local attitude towards renewable energy.

Like a number of municipalities around the country, this township about 60 km south
of Nagoya City, has its own unfortunate story related to solar development. That and
gaps in local resources and knowledge about renewables are making it more and
more difficult for developers to move forward with projects in rural Japan.

That bodes ill for the government's 2030 climate targets. To meet internationally
declared cuts in greenhouse gases, METI estimates that Japan needs to boost its
operational solar capacity to 103-118 GW, from the current 66 GW. With other
renewables unlikely to fill the gap near-term, reversing the malaise that's descended
on the solar sector is crucial.

The country needs a growth strategy that makes communities happy and allows
operators to turn a profit, though working in the confines of the law. That's the basis
for a key advisory panel launched by the government. Its role is to be the peacemaker
between renewables operators and communities.

What challenges will the government's experts need to tackle? For this special report,
Japan NRG visited the nation's auto industry heartland of Nagoya to speak with a
community in conflict.


Policy background
On Oct 17, the government re-launched a four-ministry advisory panel that is tasked
with resolving conflicts between renewable operators and communities. The panel
was originally formed in April this year.

The panel advises METI, the MoE, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. The experts spent
their first meeting discussing forestry protection, effective regulatory oversight, and
improving communications between operators and communities.

Along with its previous peacemaker role, the panel has an additional mission to
explore expansion of renewable capacities.


Big Trouble in Little Chita
About 60 kilometers south of Nagoya is the coastal town of Minami Chita. In the first
hour of the drive from Nagoya, the scenes are industrial with trucks heading to JERA’s
thermal power stations, as well as to Nippon Steel and Aichi Steel. But then the
landscape turns green.

Minami Chita is a laid-back fishing and farming community with a population of about
4,000. The area is mostly flat with no tall structures. Locals say “seaside” to mean east
and “mountainside” to mean west.

The town is bordered on the north by small mountains owned by the local farms. Two
years ago, the Nagoya-based developer DSS started to buy up property and applied
to the town with a plan to build some 9.9 kW solar power stations in the mountain
area. There’s little regulatory scrutiny over solar projects smaller than 10 kW. Little did
the locals know that DSS was planning 107 units of the mini-solar stations.

DSS began construction in 2021, tearing down areas far larger than land needed for a
9.9 kW power station. Not only that. Workers were intruding into unauthorized areas
and by “error” had depleted 1.8 hectares of forest while damaging roads.

The town asked the company to file elaborate plans and solicited help from METI and
Aichi Prefecture for stronger regulatory enforcement. In February this year, DSS
canceled the project and agreed to repair the roads and restore the forests at its own
expense. The town confirmed to Japan NRG that the road repairs had mostly been
completed.


Community impact
Even before DSS, some residents were frustrated with solar and on-shore wind
projects. One fruit farmer told Japan NRG that for the last few years developers and
banks had been knocking on their doors, asking if they were interested in investing in
new renewables projects. The farmer was told that banks and developers would take
care of everything. Then, after a solar facility goes online, the farmer would be able to
sell it to the local grid.

“I became dizzy when I learned about the amount of money involved, so I backed out.
But some friends made a hideous profit by reselling the facilities,” said one local
carpenter, who was also invited to projects.

That's pretty much all that was at stake, says a local restaurant owner. “At the end of
the day, it’s all about money. People weren’t getting into the power business because
they had strong opinions on energy. Many neglect the plant's maintenance and
wouldn’t know whom to contact if they catch fire, or if panels were blown away by
strong wind,” said a restaurant owner.

Numerous municipalities shared similar concerns and the four-ministry panel on
community conflicts drafted action plans in summer that included:
•  Increased oversight for small solar units, conducting on-site checks to spot large
projects pretending to be multiple small projects,
•  Require developers to gain all approvals before starting forest projects
•  Disclose project details in front of town meetings before construction starts

The problem was that many operators weren’t energy experts or pioneers. News of
tighter regulations drove them to consider exit strategies. And they got stuck.
“Removing the plant costs money, they realized, and they have no idea how to
dispose of or recycle the panels,” said one resident close to a solar plant.



18

The Minami Chita township tightened its solar safety guidelines with immediate effect
in February 2022, and the guidelines will be escalated into ordinances pending town
assembly approval later this year.

Some local construction firms won’t engage with renewable projects, including
residential rooftop solar panel installations, although the recent regulations don’t
cover residential systems. “Go speak to solar panel manufacturers like Panasonic if
you want a rooftop solar,” said another local carpenter.

Some community members have mixed feelings, as they feel there is a need for new
power sources. In the last two or three years, three gasoline service stations closed.
One was due to the absence of a business heir, and the others due to the regulatory
requirement to overhaul their 30-year-old tank facilities. The owners decided it wasn’t
worth investing in new tanks.

“I’m keen to drive electric vehicles and the good news is the local supermarket has
decided to open a new charging station,” said a local car repair shop owner. She
hopes for charging stations powered by locally generated solar power.

Some added that they saw DSS as an extreme case and it would be a great loss to the
community if all renewable projects were perceived negatively.


METI panel has lots of work
Municipal governments will still have a vital role in gathering the renewable energy
businesses and community stakeholders. Compared to cities, there’s vibrant
communication between the municipality and town residents in places the size of
Minami Chita, because taxpayers want the small local budget to be spent wisely.

Ties are strong enough to build frameworks for clean power supplies, and
communities will be rewarded from them. There is already a foundation for
community-wide collaboration since locals are very aware that a better future will only
materialize if they begin work today.

Many would be happy to engage in a clean energy value chain that will be relevant to
current projects to transform the Chita area into an "organic farm capital", for
example. The town coordinating plans and measures with neighboring villages is also
important.

“Varying regulations and guidelines would only create the impression that after all
that commotion, the government was unable to bring renewable businesses under
control,” said one home builder. “People will say, no renewables, period.”

Some municipalities may be empathetic to Minami Chita’s experiences but not all
areas are the same. Policies need to be uniform and strictly enforced while offering
flexibility to take into account the needs of each area.

This is precisely what the re-launched METI panel needs to clarify. This work load is a
tall order, and the panel certainly has its work cut out in the coming months.

Reactor Life Extensions: A Quick but Temporary Solution for Japan

In tough times, it pays to stretch your money and make it work a little bit harder. This
is especially true if the money at stake is $40 billion. That’s roughly the amount
Japanese firms have spent since the Fukushima disaster to revamp nuclear safety.

Despite the rich outlay, most of the utilities have so far failed to reap any benefits.
Less than one in five of the nation’s nuclear reactors are currently online. What’s
worse, after the 2011 accident a 40-year limit was placed on the equipment’s
operating life. So far, most of the reactors have spent over a quarter of that life fixing
pipes and polishing the dust, all without producing a kW of electricity.

So it comes as little surprise that Prime Minister Kishida made headlines in recent
months arguing for more of the Japanese nuclear fleet to be brought online. But even
if his words move regulators and local politicians to accelerate the restart process,
current reactor economics look grim. Safety upgrades have increased utility
investments into the nuclear stations by about 30-40%. And yet, the facilities have
spent a quarter of their permitted life without earning a single yen.

It was only a matter of time before the issue of operational life extension came up. But
this can’t be more than a temporary answer.


Background
Before the 2011 accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP, Japan counted 54 operable
nuclear reactors. When the disaster was analyzed, reactor age often came up as an
issue since the older units lacked some of the new safety features of more recent
models. This pushed utilities to agree to decommission more than 20 of the older,
smaller or experimental units (This includes six units of the damaged Fukushima Dai-
Ichi NPP and four units of the not damaged but nearby Fukushima Dai-Ni NPP).

Today, there are 33 reactors classified as operable by the industry regulator, the NRA.
Only 17 of those have so far received NRA approval to come back online. This figure
includes two units at TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, which the regulator has again
“frozen” pending probes into onsite safety culture.

Only 10 reactors have made it all the way back to generating electricity, a process that
also requires a green light from local municipalities and prefectural chiefs. With some
of the 10 currently down for maintenance or additional safety upgrade work, just six
reactors are on the grid as of late October.


Rebranding the restarts
Since coming into office a year ago, PM Kishida has unveiled an ambitious
decarbonization program called “Green Transformation”, or GX for short. The
program is supposed to involve multiple elements, many of which are as yet
undefined. One that has come front and center in recent months, however, is the
need to revive nuclear energy in Japan.

20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Kishida’s interest in nuclear energy clearly increased as energy prices jumped over the
past year. It peaked after western sanctions related to Russia’s war in Ukraine put
energy security on high alert.

As a result, the great taboo of Japanese politics of the last decade – discussing the
construction of new nuclear power plants – has been broken. In the past few months,
PM Kishida, METI and key government figures have floated plans to:

o Extend the lifespan of all operable reactors from 40 years to a maximum
of 60 years
o Scrap the lifespan limit entirely and review facilities on a regular basis
o Build new reactors to replace aging units
o Consider sites for entirely new nuclear stations
o Support the development of next-generation nuclear technology.

The ideas above are the boldest pronouncements by the government in a decade.
And, without many other elements of GX visible or tangible at this moment, it feels
almost as if the GX platform was put forward as a way to rebrand nuclear energy in
the country.

Of course, for the administration, there is ample cover. Renewed interest in nuclear
energy is a global trend and extending the lifespan of reactors is happening even in
locations that hitherto fiercely opposed the idea. Germany's recent reversal of
pledges to phase out its nuclear units by the end of this year follows on the heels of
similar decisions by Belgium, California, and the Netherlands, among others.

Portraying nuclear restarts as a way to cut LNG imports, leaving more on the market
for other players, and a bulwark against further yen weakening, are other talking
points Kishida and METI have deployed.


Short-term fix
Keeping as much existing nuclear capacity online is vital for the economics of
domestic utilities, which in turn affects the bills of ordinary consumers and businesses.
After 2011, Japan’s power firms spent approximately $90 billion more on coal, LNG
and oil supplies to cover the gap left by nuclear capacity. In that context, $40 billion
invested in nuclear safety upgrades is a cost that should pay itself back.

The challenge for the government and the utilities, however, is the Fukushima
accident severely cut available domestic power capacity, and as a result heightened
energy security concerns. The decommissioning of older reactors eliminated more
than 16.3 GW in baseload power capacity. TEPCO alone lost 10 nuclear units through
the accident itself and public pressure.

So, extending the lifespan of remaining reactors is really a way to prevent further
capacity leakage. As a result, it is only a temporary solution.

So far, only four reactors are approved to operate for an additional 20 years (Mihama
#3, Takahama #1・2 and Tokai Dai-Ni). But, as per the graph above, other reactors
are soon to reach their 40-year limit. Giving them a 20-year extension buys Japan time

to find other ways to plug the capacity gap, but does not solve it since eventually the
reactors will need to decommission.

Permitted operating life of reactors in Japan
(Remaining permit life in blue)






















Source: Power companies, METI


Nuclear plant planning and construction often takes a decade or more, so if the older
units are to be replaced with the latest reactors, discussion on this needs to start
almost as soon as the 20-year extension is granted.

Furthermore, reactor construction and operations require engineering and human
resources that have started to disperse since the Fukushima accident. To retain staff
and vendors for the nuclear industry, the government needs to offer a vision for the
future. To attract the best young minds, that vision cannot be about standing still by
replacing existing technology with similar units. There has to be emphasis on new
developments.

In a way, METI’s nuclear industry strategy published in the summer vaunted the
potential of four reactor technologies in addition to the regular BWR/ ABWR and PWR
tech that account for all of the commercial reactors in Japan today. The following GX
committee discussions, however, focused on improved (“advanced”) versions of the
same BWR and PWR reactors.

It's normal for governments to focus on the immediate future, and simply getting
social and legal approval for reactor life extensions will require a massive amount of
political capital. But if Kishida truly believes in a nuclear energy future for Japan, his
government will need to provide a more exciting vision for next-gen reactors to tempt
next-gen talent.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Asia/ Wind power
Asia will surpass the EU in offshore wind power by 2030, and eventually garner 60% of
total global capacity by 2050. In 2019, Asia had 5 GW of installed offshore wind
capacity, while Europe had 19 GW, said the International Renewable Energy Agency.
EU turbine-makers still have a technological advantage over Chinese competitors.

China/ Natural gas
Sinopec discovered major shale gas reserves in the Sichuan basin. With daily natural
gas production reaching 258,600 c/m, and an estimated resource capacity of 388
bcm, it's touted as a breakthrough for China’s shale gas sector.

China/ Renewables
About $14 trillion investment in power and transportation is needed by 2060 to reach
Beijing’s goal of net zero emissions, said the World Bank. The ruling Party congress
last week reaffirmed its green energy plans.

EU/ Natural gas price
Thanks to warm weather and near full gas storage, EU natural gas prices dropped
below €100/ MWh for the first time since Russian supplies were cut. EU gas prices are
now 70% below August levels, when they soared over €300/MWh, but they’re still well
above the €20 to €40/ MWh range they traded at over the past decade.

Germany/ Coal
The government has again legalized the use of idled brown coal capacity to next
summer. Already, one small wind farm is being dismantled to expand an open-pit
lignite coal mine operated by RWE. The company said this will “strengthen the
security of supply in Germany during the energy crisis.”

Kazakhstan/ Green hydrogen
Svevind Energy Group will build a $50 billion hub that will annually produce about 2
million tons of green hydrogen. The project consists of a 40 GW renewable energy
station (wind, solar), and a 20 GW water electrolysis production, mainly for export to
the EU.

Poland/ Nuclear power
U.S. firm Westinghouse Electric will build Poland's first nuclear power plant. The first
stage envisions three AP1000 reactors to start by 2033, with an additional three
possibly to be built. If completed in full, total capacity would be as much as 9 GW.

Slovakia/ Nuclear power
Slovakia's 471 MW Mochovce Unit 3 nuclear power plant is expected to launch in
early 2023. The unit will produce about 3.7 TWh per year, nearly 13% of Slovakia's
electricity consumption.

U.S./ Wind power
The White House wants to spark an offshore wind power boom, growing the industry
from less than 1 GW today to 30 GW by the end of the decade. But executives are
concerned that many challenges are pushing that target beyond reach: permits are
too slow, leases too expensive, equipment is in short supply and inflation is high.

UK/ Energy tax
The de facto windfall tax on low carbon electricity companies will have “catastrophic
consequences” for investment in green technologies. The policy was introduced to
raise funds for the government’s energy bills support plan for households and could
remain in place until the end of 2027. The bill is still in Parliament.

Oil services
Schlumberger is rebranding from an oilfield services giant to a global energy
innovation company, changing its name to SLB. CEO Olivier Le Peuch said: “Our new
identity symbolizes SLB’s commitment to moving farther and faster in facilitating the
world’s energy needs and forging the road ahead for the energy transition.”
