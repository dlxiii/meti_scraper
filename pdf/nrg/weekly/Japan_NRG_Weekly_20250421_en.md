by summer 2025. The focus will be:
o  Identifying conditions to promote industrial clustering near decarbonized power sources
and reduce energy price gaps with other countries;
o  Consider measures such as targeted financing, regulatory reforms, and investment
incentives;
o  Address a shortage of industrial land that is estimated to be at half the level of 1996 and
the mismatch between supply and demand across prefectures;
o  Benchmark international practices, such as France's approach to data center location
planning, which involves govt designation of 35 areas close to nuclear power plants to
support the AI-driven national strategy;
o  Attract foreign investment by assessing Japan's competitive advantages.
•  CONTEXT: The GX 2040 Vision formulated in February emphasizes the need to accelerate the clustering
of industries with a view to utilize decarbonized power sources in terms of GX industrial location.
Supply is needed to cover the vast amount of electricity consumed by AI data centers.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is exploring a similar strategic site-selection method as France, and may designate certain
zones as favorable for new data centers based on the availability and proximity of nuclear and renewable
energy. This is reminiscent of the Special Economic Zones approach of PM Abe’s govt in the early part of the
previous decade.

TOCOM  power futures trading hits record high in March 2025

(Exchange statement, April 9)
•  Power futures trading on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) surged to a record 12,600
contracts in March, over 2.5 times higher than the previous peak of 4,853 contracts in May 2022.
•  A single day’s trading volume on March 13 reached a historic high of 711 GWh, significantly
surpassing the prior daily record of 153 GWh on Nov 7, 2024.
•  Off-floor transactions dominated activity, accounting for 154 of the total 167 trades. On March 13,
annual baseload contracts for the East accounted for 9,720 contracts.
•  Smaller-scale futures trades also increased, suggesting growing participation among new power
retailers, with trades as small as one contract per month observed.
•  CONTEXT: Q1 was particularly strong. February’s trading volumes were 205.7 GWh, a 2.3-fold
increase from the previous month. Among the drivers was a concern about the wholesale power price for
West Japan.

EGC discusses reflecting inflation in revenue cap system
(Government statement, April 15)
•  At an EGC expert meeting, the Transmission and Distribution Grid Council and TSOs called to adjust
the revenue cap system to reflect rising labor costs and inflation.
•  Currently, the cap does not allow for inflation-based cost increases, thus requiring companies to
absorb rising expenses.
•  Experts agreed that such adjustments should be made in the second regulatory period (FY2028-
FY2032). Some argued it should also apply retroactively to the first period (FY2023-FY2027), since
the cost impact has already been significant, estimated at ¥150 billion in FY2023 alone.
•  The EGC will continue to discuss the factors contributing to price increases, as well as the
differences in the numbers reported by each operator, and further standardization and refinement of
the calculation methodologies.

•  CONTEXT: The T&D network usage charge, known as the "wheeling charge," was previously calculated
using the "total cost method”. But from FY2023 it’s calculated using the "revenue cap system". Operators
prepare five-year business plans, and the govt reviews the costs necessary to implement these plans
(revenue cap).



Hitachi Energy selected for HVDC to deliver 6 GW of renewables in India

TEPCO's 5th business plan discussions resume, target for summer completion
(Denki Shimbun, April 18)
•  The Nuclear Damage Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation Corp (NDF) resumed talks on
TEPCO's 5th Comprehensive Special Business Plan. It hopes to complete these issues in summer.
•  Key focus includes improving cash flow, and funding must be ensured for decommissioning and
compensation (¥500 billion a year). Reducing that amount could signal a lack of commitment.
TEPCO cites inflation and safety-related investments as factors straining cash flow.
•  There were calls for TEPCO to pursue alliances beyond its JERA venture.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Niigata rejects referendum on Kashiwazaki-Kariwa restart
(Nikkei, April 18)
o  The Niigata Pref Assembly rejected a proposed referendum on restarting the Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa NPP. The idea had strong public support.
o  Governor Hanazumi, who opposed a simple Yes/No vote, plans to hold public hearings and
surveys instead.
o  Opposition parties supported the referendum, while the LDP and Komeito argued nuclear
policy is a national issue.
• TAKEAWAY: The main argument against a referendum was that its binary nature (Yes/No) did not reflect the
complex reality of restarting a NPP. Yet, the biggest issue for the govt is that it would have set a precedent for
any other nuclear power-related project in Japan seeking local consensus, which is often lacking.

Japanese Firms Expand SE Asia LNG Projects as Region Shifts to Gas
Japan’s top utilities and energy companies are accelerating their LNG push into Asia as
they seek to capitalize on new markets for the fuel. Southeast Asia is of particular
interest and a key component of METI’s 2020 international energy strategy.

As of today, Japanese firms including JERA, Tokyo Gas, and KEPCO are active in about
30 projects across Asia-Pacific that span the entire value chain, from distribution
infrastructure and regasification terminals, to gas-fired power plants. The proposed
generation capacity of projects with Japanese involvement has climbed to about 60 GW.

The context is that Japan faces an oversupply of LNG in the coming years and needs to
build ‘secondary’ markets to sell its surplus. Long-term offtake agreements with
Australia, Qatar, Malaysia, and the U.S. helps to protect Japan’s security of supply but
also lock buyers into volumes that the domestic market seems no longer able to absorb.
Should METI’s own 2040 national energy mix forecasts materialize, demand will wane
further.
Despite softening domestic demand, the government sees it as imperative to defend
Japan’s position as one of the top players in the LNG sector. That means finely balancing
new investment in supply and the demand side within an industry often susceptible to
economic and political changes.

Japan NRG takes a look at the significant LNG-related projects with Japanese
involvement in Southeast Asia, as well as at the region’s overall outlook in this sector.

JERA and Tokyo Gas
As Japan's major LNG traders, JERA and Tokyo Gas are leading related infrastructure
expansion in Asia. JERA has set a goal of introducing LNG to Asia’s coal-and-oil reliant
countries, while Tokyo Gas seeks to develop a specifically South-Asian LNG chain.
The driver is
straightforward: Japan
wants to diversify its LNG
supply sources to improve
energy security. This
necessitates creating new
overseas markets for the fuel
in places like Vietnam,
Indonesia, and the
Philippines. With more
Asian nations turning to
LNG, Japanese firms can
play the role of re-seller, or
trader of the fuel. And, if
Japan suddenly runs short,
there would in theory be
more LNG cargoes in the
region to buy or swap.

Of course, the opportunities for Japanese players are not limited to trading the
molecules.

In February 2025, Tokyo Gas made its first investment in an operational overseas LNG
terminal. It acquired a 20% stake in FGEN LNG Corp, which owns and operates a
floating LNG terminal in Batangas City in the Philippines. Tokyo Gas said it will support
the facility’s operations and maintenance, leveraging its experience of managing LNG
terminals in Japan.
Further downstream, Tokyo Gas is involved in a LNG-to-power project in Thai Binh
Province, Vietnam, that includes a 1.5 GW gas-fired power plant and an offshore LNG
receiving terminal. The 2024 investment partners the Japanese gas utility with Truong
Thanh Viet Nam (TTVN) and an overseas unit of Kyushu Electric – Kyuden International
Corp. The goal is to start power operations by 2029.

The above has built on another Vietnamese LNG-to-power project Tokyo Gas launched
in 2022. The $2 billion project involves bringing gas-fired power to the Quang Ninh
Province, with operations slated for the latter half of the 2020s.
The arrival of gas-fired power and LNG imports to Southeast Asia is a recent
phenomenon.

The Philippines and Vietnam only began importing LNG in 2023, as did Hong Kong. The
first LNG cargoes reached Cambodia and Myanmar just a few years before that.

Population and economic growth, however, are pushing a very steep demand
trajectory. Petrovietnam’s PV Gas estimates that the nation’s LNG imports will reach 9
million tons per annum (MTPA) by 2030 and 15 MTPA by 2035, for a total value of $7.2
billion. Despite this, Vietnam has not secured any long-term LNG contracts; the same for
the Philippines.

This means Japanese firms are not only playing the role of LNG sellers – they are
helping to prepare the institutional and logistical networks for Southeast Asia to lean
into the fuel. In December 2023, JERA signed an MoU to assist with the introduction of
LNG in the Philippines. For value chain development, JERA also signed an MoU with a
subsidiary of Indonesia’s state-owned electricity company PLN for collaboration.
Previously, JERA proposed a 4.5 GW LNG-fired power plant and import terminal with
ExxonMobil in Vietnam. Should it go ahead, that project alone would require imports of
about 6 MTPA. Such volumes would complement JERA’s sales in its domestic market
and allow it to redirect LNG vessels to balance surpluses / shortages in Japan.

The origin of much of this LNG is likely to be Australia and the U.S. JERA sees U.S. LNG
as an attractive option: there is abundant supply, relatively low costs, and now with
Trump in the White House – strong support from the government. At the very least, this
indicates that U.S. projects would get faster approval for construction and exports
compared to Australia.
Flexible contract terms in the U.S. market are another big selling point for Japanese
firms like JERA that have ambitions to trade LNG in the Asia region. JERA is leveraging
the flexibility of American contracts to push Australian suppliers to do the same.

Asia’s LNG landscape
Global LNG demand is expected to grow to 630-718 MTPA by 2040, up from the 407
MTPA in 2024, with Asia the main driver behind this 60% growth, according to Shell. By
2030, Shell forecasted a growth of 170 MTPA.
Analysts at the environmental think-tank IEEFA are more circumspect. Such a boom in
LNG implies a shift away from coal and no serious competitive threat from other energy
sources. Meanwhile, coal’s share of the energy mix hit a record (62%) in Indonesia in
2023 – similar to levels in the Philippines. Plus, the average age of coal-fired power
plants was just 11 years when the IEA last reported the data in 2021.
Another issue is the slow progress of many Southeast Asia LNG projects, primarily in
terms of contracting and negotiation. For example, Tokyo Gas and Pertamina in 2015
worked on an LNG terminal in Indonesia, but it was deferred due to uncertain demand.

What’s more, Japan is not the only LNG powerhouse in Asia anymore. Looking at the
Asian market, there are at least two major competitors to Japan’s LNG export strategy:
China and Singapore. China has overtaken Japan as the world’s largest LNG importer,
and with its U.S.-origin cargoes now under the cloud of tariffs, Chinese trading volumes
are rising.
Still, Japan’s state energy firm JOGMEC believes that Tokyo’s strategy has every chance
of success. When asked by Japan NRG, JOGMEC noted that while Chinese imports this
year are at the lowest levels since 2019, intensified LNG trading activity by China and
Japan is likely to be complementary. The two can inject liquidity and volumes in the
Asian market, supporting the trend rather than directly competing with each other.

Singapore is also positioning itself as a major LNG trading hub thanks to its hosting of
many financial institutions, oil companies, and trading platforms. Most of the Japanese
firms have also opened LNG trading desks in the city.
Japan cannot compete with the financial infrastructure of Singapore but it has made a
start. The Tokyo Commodity Exchange, for example, launched yen-denominated LNG
futures in 2022, though growth in trading volumes has been slow. Expanding this
market will be crucial to Japan’s ability to hedge against price fluctuations.

Conclusion
For Japanese firms, securing a foothold in Southeast Asia by participating in
infrastructure projects allows them to retain leverage in price negotiations. The LNG
market is projected to expand in the region, and Japan’s industry veterans smell a
business opportunity.

Still, Japan claims that its LNG strategy is not only about economic advantage, but also a
matter of energy security. As the country looks to buy more LNG from the U.S., so as to
appease the Trump administration, the plan of reselling LNG to Asian countries gains
further strategic significance amid shrinking domestic demand.
Through recent initiatives such as the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), Japan has
laid the political groundwork to promote LNG as a critical bridge fuel in the transition to
a lower-carbon future. For this, critics accuse Japan of locking Asia into another fossil
fuel.

Yet with few other actors coming into the region to finance major shifts to other energy
sources, Japan’s offer may be the most pragmatic on the table.

What’s That Smell? E-Methane Pitches an
Alternative to the Hydrogen Society

Japan has created artificial islands using landfill waste. One such plot in Tokyo Bay even
has the cheerful name “Dream Island.” Now, the country is putting waste to use in a
supply chain that offers a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels.

Last year, a demonstration project in Osaka City, currently host to the World Expo,
utilized raw garbage and renewable energy to produce e-methane, a synthetic gas that
promises to recycle CO2 without adding to the global carbon footprint, all while utilizing
existing gas infrastructure. A similar pilot is in operation just south of Tokyo, in the city
of Yokohama. And while small, the tests indicate the potential for mass scale production
already by the end of this decade.
Capturing the gases emitted from burning waste is just one of the pathways Japan is
trialing to form the outline of a next-generation, low-carbon gas system. While
electrification is expected to shift some of the energy demand from molecules to
electrons, the country is still one of the top importers of natural gas via LNG. Almost half
of those volumes are deployed in heating and industrial equipment – areas that are
harder to electrify and abate. That suggests a substantial market for cleaner gas
substitutes.
Traditionally, the process of methanation involves synthesizing methane from hydrogen
and CO2. The latter is recovered from the atmosphere or industrial emissions. When the
hydrogen is made with renewable energy, the end-product is called e-methane. Like the
liquid synthetic fuels (e-fuels), e-methane is touted as the future lynchpin of energy
systems because it does not increase atmospheric CO2 levels over its lifecycle and has
higher heating value per unit than hydrogen or ammonia when combusted.

One of the biggest stumbling blocks to creating an energy system based on synthetic
fuels like e-methane, however, has been the cost of producing hydrogen (H2). This is
why Japan has started testing several ways to make e-methane, some of which do not
require H2 as a feedstock.
Current gas needs
In Japan, the majority of natural gas is imported as LNG, and the consumption ratio (in
FY2022) was 54% for electricity, 35% for city gas, and 10% for other uses. The
breakdown of city gas use by sector was 59% for industrial, 23% for residential, and
10% for commercial.

Industrial use is primarily as a fuel for heat source equipment, such as steam boilers and
furnaces, and as a fuel for power generation. Residential and commercial use is
primarily for heat source equipment such as kitchens, water heaters, and space heaters.

To reduce GHG emissions, various firms have developed gas turbines and boilers, etc
that can switch to hydrogen or ammonia, and some electrified options are also starting
to appear. Still, in cases where there’s a need for high temperatures and/or large
equipment, retaining existing gas-based supply chains and infrastructure but switching
to a cleaner fuel is seen as ideal.

R&D Trends in e-Methane
Methanation methods can be broadly divided into chemical and biological reactions. The
former relies on the Sabatier reaction (CO2 + 4 H2 → CH4 + 2 H2O) with a catalyst,
but the scale of the output needs to be grown. Much of Japan’s R&D in this area is
focused on finding more efficient synthesis through discovering better catalysts.
Methanation using biological reactions (bio-methanation) swaps the catalyst for
methane-producing bacteria. However, its scale at this point is even smaller than for a
chemical reaction.

Pilot projects
E-methane as a clean energy solution has drawn interest from numerous sectors
including shippers, heavy duty transportation (i.e., trucks and buses), high-temperature
industrial processes (steel, cement, and ceramics), as well as the chemical industry.
The main companies driving the development of e-methane in Japan, however, are the
two large gas utilities from Tokyo and Osaka, the oil and LNG producer INPEX, and the
top engineering group, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI).
Tokyo Gas started small-scale methanation tests in 2021, which progressed into a pilot
project that pools together several players into a fully contained local supply chain.
Thanks to an agreement with Yokohama City in 2022, MHI installed a system to capture
flue gas at a municipal waste-to-energy facility (Tsurumi Plant) that is then transported
to the Tokyo Gas Yokohama Techno Station for methanation using the Sabatier method.
The pilot operates at a rate of 400-500 Nm3 of e-methane per hour. In the 2030s when
the technology is deemed mature, this is expected to ramp up to tens of thousands of
Nm3/ h.
Assuming a methanation facility with a nameplate capacity of 10,000 Nm3 is able to run
nonstop year-round, its annual output would be close to 88 million Nm3. This would
help Tokyo Gas get close to its requirement of substituting 1% of city gas sales with e-
methane by 2030, as per the national target. (Based on a m3 to Nm3 conversion that

Osaka Gas and INPEX have a similar scale Sabatier methanation project (400 Nm3/ h)
that aims to use the synthetic fuel in the local gas pipeline system. Gas extracted from
one of Japan’s largest gas fields, in Nagaoka, Niigata Pref, will be sent to a methanation
facility due to be commissioned this (FY2025) fiscal year.

To spread public awareness of methanation as a future clean energy pathway, Osaka
Gas has also created a small-scale pilot to coincide with the World Expo, which kicked
off April 13 in the company’s home city.

The project is deploying the Sabatier method to extract biogas from household waste
(CH), supplement it with CO2 collected through Direct Air Capture, and bind it to
4
hydrogen made with renewable energy. Kanadevia supplied the methanation
equipment.
Other approaches
The Green Innovation Fund has seeded a number of projects to develop other
methanation methods, such as a “hybrid Sabatier” approach, which relies on PEM
electrolyzers (the “PEMCO2 Reduction” system), and new technologies that work at low
temperatures.
The hybrid Sabatier process claims not only to improve efficiency (from 50% to 80%) by
more effectively utilizing waste heat from electrolysis (an endothermic reaction), but
also promises to make devices smaller and at a lower cost. Among potential future
demand centers is Japan’s space agency. JAXA and MHI are developing a liquid
methane-fueled engine for a next-generation rocket that is expected to take off around
2030.
Electrochemical reduction (PEMCO2) is a technology that reacts at low temperatures
(about 80°C), eliminating the need for thermal management, which is a problem with
the Sabatier reaction. PEMCO2 is also a much simpler industrial structure, making it
cheaper. The main proponent of this approach is MHI’s domestic rival IHI Corp, which
sees this tech as capable of manufacturing from tens to several hundred Nm3/ h by
FY2030.

The most interesting approach, however, may be pursued by Osaka Gas. The west Japan
utility is backing the development of bio-methanation and Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell
(SOEC) – this methanation process uses Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) technology. First,

water and CO2 are electrolyzed using an SOEC electrolyzer to produce H2 and CO using
renewable energy. Next, methane is synthesized from these in a catalytic reaction. Not
requiring hydrogen as a raw material is a key feature.
In addition, electrolysis at high temperatures (around 700-800°C) reduces the amount of
renewable energy required. By effectively utilizing the heat generated during methane
synthesis, it is possible to achieve a world-leading energy conversion efficiency of 85-
90%. The result could significantly reduce the cost of producing e-methane.

Together with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,
Osaka Gas hopes to develop SOEC methanation-related technologies into a unified
supply chain by 2030.

International cooperation
The domestic projects offer glimmers of technological progress, but for volume,
Japanese companies are looking elsewhere. A Japan-U.S. consortium including Tokyo
Gas, Toho Gas, Mitsubishi Corp and Sempra Infrastructure is promoting the ReaCH4
Project on the Gulf Coast of the U.S.
The aim is to build the world's first large-scale e-methane supply chain that will be
capable of producing 180 million Nm3 of e-methane (close to 130,000 tons) in FY2030.
Sempra refers to e-methane as e-natural gas and intends to use its Cameron LNG
terminal in southwest Louisiana for liquefaction of the gas before its transport to Japan.

In November 2023, Tokyo Gas and Santos announced plans to conduct a feasibility
study on a project to produce e-methane in the Cooper Basin in central eastern
Australia. The Australian energy firm has developed gas fields in the area for decades.
The project aims to export 60,000 tons of e-methane per year (equivalent to 80 million
m3 of city gas) to Japan from 2030, with a view to scaling that up even further.
Osaka Gas is conducting feasibility studies across several regions but especially in
America, Australia and Southeast Asia, looking to build on existing natural gas and LNG
facilities. The utility is keen on establishing an e-methane hub in either Nebraska or
western Wyoming where it can source cheap hydrogen, and then send the product by
pipeline to Texas to ship to Japan.

The utility is ready to invest as much as ¥100 billion in the U.S. e-methane projects and
wants to import as much as 200,000 tons of the synthetic fuel by 2030. Work on basic
project design started earlier this year.

To build the sector’s visibility, in October 2024, Japanese firms founded an international
alliance called e-NG Coalition to pool together firms that promote e-methane (aka e-
natural gas). They want to create a global market by standardizing GHG emission
calculation and certification standards.
The nine founding companies were Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas, Mitsubishi Corp,
Engie, RWE, Sempra Infrastructure, Tree Energy Solutions Belgium (TES) and
Totalenergies. Since then, the membership has increased to 20 with IHI and INPEX
among the new faces.

How to pay for this?
As with e-fuel, the biggest issue for e-methane is reducing production costs, which are
typically five times that of LNG. According to some producer’s calculations, the cost of
synthetic methane (CIF price) is currently ¥250/ Nm3 using the Sabatier method. The
plan is to reduce this to about ¥120/ Nm3 by FY2030, and to ¥50/ Nm3 by FY2050
through better technology and lower hydrogen feedstock.

Even that price trajectory requires additional fees. For now, Japan is considering a
number of approaches to cover the price gaps including some form of an e-methane
marketplace, or by further expanding quotas from the current 1% by 2030.
The latter would still require a way for the buyers to pass on the higher costs compared
to LNG. These may be addressed either through a contract for difference (CfD) support
scheme, as already initiated late last year on the back of the Hydrogen Society
Promotion Act. Another alternative is the gas wheeling charges system.

It's likely that several of the above will need to be put into place within the next three
years or so to enable e-methane to gain a foothold in Japan’s energy system. The results
of this year’s CfD – which allows the subsidies to cover e-methane – may be the first
indication of which way the sector will develop commercially.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Renewables
ACEN Australia completed its AU$750 million portfolio debt financing to support renewable
energy expansion. The financing will support the 400 MW Stubbo Solar project in New South
Wales.
Australia / Solar power
Octopus Australia will soon start construction on the AU$300 million Fulham Solar Farm. The
project will have an 80 MW solar farm and a 128-MWh battery project.

China / Coal
Coal production set a new monthly record of 441 Mt in March, as the country focuses on
increasing domestic output and reducing reliance on imports. Coal production has totalled
1,203 Mt so far this year, up from 1,106 Mt in the same period in 2024, and surpassing the
previous record of 1,153 Mt in 2023.
Data Centers/ Electricity demand
Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is projected to more than double by 2030 to
around 945 TWh, said the International Energy Agency. Electricity demand from AI-optimized
data centers alone will more than quadruple by 2030.

India / Hydro power
The Central Electricity Authority approved six hydro projects – Upper Indravati (600 MW) in
Odisha; Sharavathy (2 GW) in Karnataka; Bhivpuri (1 GW) in Maharashtra; Bhavali (1.5 GW)
in Maharashtra; MP-30 (1.9 GW) in Madhya Pradesh; and Chitravathi (500 MW) in Andhra
Pradesh.
India / LPG
India plans to end taxes on U.S. ethane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports as it looks
to reduce its trade surplus and ease its tariff burden.

India / Renewables
India continues to expand renewable energy capacity, installing nearly 30 GW of solar and
wind power in FY2025. According to JMK Research, compared to 2024, installations for both
solar and wind increased 58.5% to 23.8 GW and 27.9% to 4.1 GW, respectively.

Indonesia / LPG
Indonesia proposed increasing imports of crude oil and LPG from the U.S. by $10 billion as part
of tariff negotiations, said energy minister Bahlil Lahadalia.
Singapore / Power grid
Singapore is stepping up efforts to strengthen its power grid and diversify energy sources, with
natural gas — currently powering 95% of the country’s electricity — still playing a major role.
As the city-state targets GHG emissions of 45 Mt to 50 Mt by 2035, authorities face the dual
challenge of meeting rising energy demand while decarbonising the grid.

Vietnam / Power plan
The latest amendments to the Power Development Plan, approved by the govt earlier this
week, call for the nation to more than double total generating capacity by 2030 over 2023
levels, with the aim of increasing capacity nearly 10-fold by 2050. Solar and wind power will
be key. To meet these targets, Vietnam needs a total investment of $136 billion by 2030.
