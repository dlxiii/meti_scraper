Japan Chemical Industry Association fails 2020 carbon target
(Japan NRG, Jan. 11)
•  The Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA) reported to METI that the sector failed to reach
the 2020 target to cut 1.5 million tons of carbon emissions from 2005 levels on a business as usual
(BAU) basis. The 2020 reduction was 0.9 million tons, BAU basis.
•  The actual carbon emissions were 55 million tons, down from 58 million tons a year ago. The

emissions dropped thanks to lower plant run rates on the back of Covid, but energy efficiency
deteriorated and the reduction was 0.6 million ton short of the target.
•  The association’s 2030 reduction goal is 6.5 million tons on a BAU basis compared to 2013 levels.
It plans to revise up the 2030 target to a more ambitious level, once it achieves the 1.5 million
tons/ year reduction on a BAU basis.
•  Similarly, rubber and lime industryl bodies reported failing their 2020 reduction targets.
•  CONTEXT: The chemical sector is the second largest GHG emitter outside the energy sector, after

steel. The sector runs 38 coal-fired plants with a total capacity of 4.1 GW.
• TAKEAWAY: The industrial bodies set carbon reduction goals that aren’t legally binding. They also can decide
measurement metrics that range from BAU-basis carbon to energy efficiencies. The means there is little
recourse to verify the reported figures.

• JCIA has refused to disclose run rate details used in the BAU carbon calculations, claiming collecting
operational data of member companies may be seen as non-compliance with the anti-monopoly act.

Superconductors hold promise to reduce transmission losses
(Nikkei, Jan. 12)
•  The Railway Technical Research Institute, a research body of Japan Rail, began trialing a 1.5 km

stretch of superconducting transmission line in Kyushu.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The line carries several hundred amps at 1500 V, the amount railways use.
•  Superconductors use cryogenic temperatures to eliminate electrical resistance and thus,
transmission losses.
•  While previous technologies required conductors to be cooled to -269°C, necessitating the use of

expensive liquid helium as a coolant, the Institute developed a way to make transmission lines
superconducting at -196°; so, cheap and abundant liquid nitrogen can be used instead.
•  In part, the transmission lines are made by MESCO, a Mitsui company.
•  The technology holds promise for reducing carbon emissions: in Japan, 4.3% of electricity
generated is currently wasted due to transmission losses. In the UK the figure is 8.0%, and in India
the figure is 17.1%.



EGC to scrutinize fuel cost management of baseload power
(Japan NRG, Jan. 13)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) will monitor how baseload power
operators calculate fuel costs after bid levels rose in the recent auction.
•  The 2022 baseload capacity auction, held in November last year, settled at ¥15.69/ kWh for 4 MW

Hokkaido; ¥13.42/ kWh for 146.7 MW in east Japan; and ¥10.63/ kWh for 409.3 MW in west
Japan. No non-compliance was established, but the EGC will continue to monitor if the fuel cost
calculations were reasonable.
•  It will ask the operators with dominant market positions for more details of power generation costs,
as well as their cost and supply forecast. Seller bids rose ¥0.44/ kWh and buyer offers were also up
¥1.74/ kWh from the previous auction, the EGC said.




MoE selects Yusa Town to test streamlined offshore wind assessment system
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 12)
•  The area off the coast of Yusa Town, Yamagata Prefecture will be used to trial the new
environmental impact assessment system for offshore wind projects.

•  The MoE will conduct documentary research, interviews, and nature field surveys in the area where
offshore wind power is expected to be introduced around Yusa. The trial will start from FY2022.
•  CONTEXT: The government vowed last year to speed up the offshore wind project development
process by taking on the environmental impact assessment and other preparatory work. This would
lessen the burden on the local area as currently each potential bidder needs to conduct its own
assessment.


Four ammonia R&D projects selected for government funding

(Kankyo Business, Jan. 12)
•  NEDO announced winners for Green Innovation Fund financing for ammonia fuel and supply chain.
R&D will get a maximum of ¥68.8 billion over 10 years.
•  The winning projects are:

power plant. The R&D period is set to run for about eight years to FY2028. JERA plans to attract
transition finance to cover its own costs outside of the government funding.




Japan announces new energy initiative for ASEAN
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 13)
•  At an online event on economic cooperation between Japan and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), METI Minister Hagiuda announced the "Asia Future Investment Initiative,"

that will set the direction for economic cooperation in Asia in the post-Covid era.
•  Together with the Asia Energy Transition Initiative (AETI), announced in 2021 to support energy
transitions in Asia, the new program will invest in supply chains, connectivity, digital innovation,
and human resources.
•  This means funding to develop the market for next-gen vehicles, including EVs and hydrogen
vehicles, and utilization of biofuels, as well as continued contribution to auto supply chains in
ASEAN countries.
•  Minister Hagiuda wants to promote cooperation between public and private sectors in areas of

distributed power sources using renewable energy, geothermal power generation, ammonia co-
firing at coal power plants and CO2 capture and storage.


Toshiba Energy Systems CEO talks up firm’s decarbonization business vector

(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 14)
•  CONTEXT: This is an interview with Konishi Takao, president of Toshiba Energy Systems. The unit
owns Toshiba’s nuclear assets and Fukushima decommissioning work. The company last May
partnered with GE to become one of the first major Japanese firms involved in the sector.
•  Toshiba ES will focus even more on decarbonization products and services. One big growth area is
CCUS (carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage). Toshiba ES has already started to supply
carbon capture equipment to smaller power plants, but needs to work more on standardizing

CCUS tech costs.
•  With GE, Toshiba is discussing how to set up a Japanese production base for offshore wind parts.
It may be set up in Akita Prefecture, close to many of the offshore wind power projects.
•  Toshiba ES also acquired a U.S. plant-monitoring software business. It is used in about 40% of
thermal power plants in North America. Toshiba now hopes to expand its sales globally, especially
to clients that already run its gas turbines.

(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 11)
•  Aeon operates more than 160 malls around Japan, which account for about 0.2% of the country’s
electricity demand. All the facilities will switch to 100% renewable energy by 2040.
•  Aeon Mall plans to buy green electricity and produce its own with plans to buy land for this. The
shift to solar will begin in 2022.
•  CONTEXT: Parent company Aeon, Japan's top retail group by sales, accounts for nearly 1% of the
country's total electricity demand
•  Along with setting up solar panels at its sites, Aeon Mall will sign corporate power purchase

agreements (PPAs) and install batteries.


Euglena says research confirms its biofuel works well for coastal vessels
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 11)
•  Euglena released a report on biofuel-based navigation research for coastal vessels that showed no

major issues with using the clean-fuel technology.
The biotech firm worked with Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency to
test a tourist-type high-speed cruiser that ran on Euglena's next-generation biodiesel fuel Susteo.
•  The partners measured data on speed, fuel consumption, engine exhaust temperature, and other
factors during test cruises. Based on the successful trial, the two parties started a technical study
on the co-firing of Susteo in marine diesel engines using heavy oil A from December 2021.

New nuclear reactor model to adjust output in just 17 mins, Mitsubishi Heavy says
(Nikkei, Jan. 14)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) plans to develop a new nuclear reactor in the mid-2030s that will
be able to fine-tune its output in minutes, enabling it to respond to fluctuations in power
generation from renewable energy sources.
•  The engineering firms hopes that the technology will make nuclear as nimble as thermal power,

allowing it to take on the role of balancing the grid in a system with a high renewables component.
•  CONTEXT: Advanced gas-fired plants can adjust their output in as little as 10 minutes. Current
nuclear technology requires about an hour.
•  The reactor size is expected to range from 600 MW to 1 GW. It will be able to cut output by half in
17 minutes, a quarter of the time current reactors take. This model could be used to replace
existing reactors, according to MHI.
•  The cost of power for the new fast-responding reactor will be ¥10.02 (8.8 U.S. cents) per kWh.

That includes the cost of installing safety systems and getting fuel reprocessed.
• TAKEAWAY: This is just one of several new nuclear reactor designs that MHI is currently working on. An
update on some of them will feature in next week’s Analysis section. Judging by the timelines, work on the
reactor design mentioned in the article has started fairly recently. And, while it offers a very important feature,
quick and flexible load adjustment, the downside is: it won’t be ready until mid-2030s. In practice, this means
the reactor won’t be an option for most domestic utilities until early 2040s. As a solution for replacing the
aging fleet of reactors today, that already feels “last minute”. Given the fact that just half a year ago,

discussing new nuclear reactors in Japan was almost taboo, MHI has moved quickly to reinstate its nuclear
credential. It will need to move even faster for the plans to turn into reality.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

U.S. and Japan to collaborate on fast-breeder reactors
(Yomiuri, Jan. 9)
o  Details have emerged of a MoA to be signed this month by TerraPower in the U.S., the
Japan Atomic Energy Agency, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries regarding fast-breeder
reactor technology.
o  U.S. entities will share confidential technical information regarding fast-breeder reactor
technology with their Japanese counterparts.

o  The agreement includes development of systems for inserting and removing fuel rods
and identifying the location of broken fuel rods, improving heat exchangers and pumps
for use with molten sodium coolant, and shielding technologies.


Fukui governor speaks with tops of Kansai Electric, J-Atomic on reactor plans
(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 12)
•  Governor Sugimoto of Fukui Prefecture met with President Morimoto of Kansai Electric and

President Muramatsu of Japan Atomic Power.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: All of Kansai Electric’s nuclear plants are located in Fukui Prefecture. One of Japan
Atomic’s two plans is also in the prefecture.
•  Kansai Electric CEO Morimoto reiterated plans to find a site outside of the prefecture for interim
storage of spent fuel by the end of 2023, while J-Atomic’s Muramatsu expressed his determination
to make progress in the examination of the Tsuruga NPP Unit 2.

•  Morimoto expressed gratitude for the consent to restart the Mihama NPP Unit 3 last year.
Regarding the interim storage facility, he said: "We are considering all possibilities in cooperation
with the government and the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan.”
•  Governor Sugimoto praised the work to restart the older Mihama station without any major
problems, and hopes the same would be true for the restart of the Takahama NPP Units 1 and 2,
which, like the Mihama Unit 3 reactor, are over 40 years old. In the case of interim storage, the

governor asked for "a relationship of trust and a sense of speed."
• TAKEAWAY: This is a reminder of the precarious operating status of Kansai Electric’s nuclear reactors. The
utility has until 2023 to fix a plan to move spent fuel rods out of storage pools inside reactor buildings to a
facility outside of Fukui Prefecture. That was the deal on which it won approval to restart its nuclear fleet. With
less than two years left, Kansai must do a lot of lobbying, mostly likely in northern Japan, to secure that safe
storage site. It won’t be easy.

• Meanwhile, the cordial comments by the governor towards Japan Atomic may signal that the company is
making progress towards the restart of its Tsuruga reactor. Last year, the Nuclear Regulation Authority
suspended the reactor’s safety screening after discovering data tampering in documents submitted by the
company. The scandal threatened to stall the restart of the Tsuruga station.




Cosmo submits plans to build 400 MW offshore wind farm in Akita area
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 14)
•  A unit of Cosmo Energy Holdings, published the environmental assessment method statement for
a 400 MW offshore wind power project off the coast of Oga City, Lagoon City, and Akita City in

•  At the letter of intent stage, Cosmo Eco-power partnered in the project with Venti Japan and
Mitsubishi Corporation. But, the method statement was submitted by a venture between Cosmo,
Venti Japan, Shimizu Corporation, and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (JAPEX).




Offshore wind tender: losers unhappy about Mitsubishi’s clean sweep
(Diamond Online, Jan. 7)
•  Unsuccessful bidders were shocked at being undercut despite competitive offers.
•  A similar project in Akita was recently awarded to a Marubeni consortium for ¥36/ kWh.
•  The secret to Mitsubishi’s rock bottom offer is backing from Amazon, NTT, and beer giant Kirin

Holdings, with which Mitsubishi will have a PPA after its 20-year FIT agreement ends.

ANALYSIS


BY TAKEHIRO MASUTOMO

TOP INTERVIEW: Director at METI’s Policy Planning Division

Japan NRG sat down with KUME Takashi, Director at METI!s Policy Planning and
Coordination Division, to discuss the latest energy issues and outlook.


ASIA STRATEGY
At COP26, Prime Minister Kishida announced $10 billion in additional aid to
developing countries over the next five years. What kind of assistance is envisioned?
Japan will contribute to the decarbonization of Asia by providing support via the Asia
Energy Transition Initiative (ATI). While it’s too early to speak of specific projects,
we’re talking about support for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and LNG, too.
We will keep in mind all projects that could lead to decarbonization.

In terms of renewables, solar will be the main focus initially as it is quite difficult to set
up wind power in Asia. However, if we install a lot of solar, as is also the case in Japan,
we will need a certain amount of thermal power to manage the variable nature of solar
power. This means it’s also important to pursue zero-emission strategies for thermal
power generation.

Asia has a lot of coal-fired power plants, so efforts that promote their decarbonization
will be of great importance in the region. Japan is working on ammonia and hydrogen
strategies through the building out of the infrastructure. This is a lot of work. But we
believe it will be vital technology both for Japan and the broader Asia region, so we
will promote its development.

There are strong voices calling for Japan to abandon the promotion of LNG in ASEAN
and to focus on renewables. How do see this?

People in developed countries, including European countries and the U.S., need to
understand that Asian nations still want economic growth and need stable energy at
low cost. We can't just ask them to use renewable energy regardless of the high price,
or to use nuclear power when they don't have the technology.

Even during the transition to carbon neutrality, the issue of securing a stable supply of
fossil fuels remains, especially in LNG [which allows for an] uptake of more renewable
energy while filling in for the intermittent nature of renewable. It’s possible that other
Asian countries, in addition to China, Japan, and South Korea, will want to move from
coal to gas. And, I'm sure that people in Europe already understand the importance of
stable gas supply, no matter how difficult it is for them to say so politically. Asian
countries have the same understanding. Looking at things in a realistic light, Asian
people need stable and inexpensive fossil fuel supply during this transition.

Within the G7, Japan is the only Asian nation, but in the G20 there are other Asian
countries. Japan can play a crucial role in in these meetings to convey the message
that the energy transition has to be done with a sense of reality.

COAL
At COP26 Japan did not signal any interest in ending coal-fired power generation.
Why is coal still considered a necessity for Japan?

First of all, we are firmly committed to the goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and a
46% reduction in emissions by 2030. These goals have received strong approval
worldwide. But which route one takes to reach such goals is specific to each country.
The energy picture greatly varies from country to country.

For a nation like Japan, which is not blessed with its own energy raw materials, we
abide by the principle we call S + 3E, which calls for a balance between safety, energy
security, economic efficiency, and concern for the environment. The latest Strategic
Energy Plan1, approved in October, includes the principle that renewable energy will
be treated as a priority. In fact, the only CO2-free power generation sources available
right now are renewables and also nuclear. But even if we use those two sources to
the maximum, potential blackouts are a concern.

Unfortunately, we are not in a position where we can stop using thermal power or
even announce when we’ll phase it out completely. However, we have decided to
phase out inefficient coal-fired generation, and we can also gradually reduce
emissions by introducing ammonia as a fuel in coal-fired power plants. Our initial aim
is for ammonia to account for 20% of co-firing, but eventually we will achieve single
fuel firing of ammonia. We are now moving in this direction in a realistic manner.


RENEWABLES
The latest Strategic Energy Plan sets a goal of doubling the share of renewable
energy to 36-38%. Yet, available land for solar, the main renewable source, is limited.
So, how can Japan achieve this goal?

The share of renewables currently stands at around 18%, so within 10 years it must
double. As you say, most of that growth will come from solar. Offshore wind power
will be very important for the 2050 target, and we’re counting on its contribution, but
this decade it will be on solar to make up the numbers. Japan has about 56 GW of
solar power capacity today. This suggests we need to add about the same amount
again by 2030.

Still, it’s true that local residents are becoming more and more critical of solar power,
and the number of ordinances in place restricting further buildout of renewables has
increased fivefold in the past five years. About one in 10 municipalities now have such
ordinances. So, it’s clear that solar capacity should not expand in a way that will cause
friction with local communities.

We’ve been asking solar operators to conduct proper explanations of their projects to
local communities for a long time. Nowadays, even if a project has been certified
under the FIT system, if it violates an ordinance, the certification can be revoked. If
there is a violation, the FIT will no longer be granted and power won’t be purchased
at the higher price. This is how discipline is maintained. Still, it is based on the
premise that local people know the local situation best. The national government


1 Please note, Japan NRG translates the government’s long-term energy plan into English as the “Basic Energy Plan”. METI
refers to it as “Strategic Energy Plan”.
13


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

can't impose a uniform request to do this or that. We simply ask municipalities to
discuss the matter carefully.

The Ministry of Environment (MoE) is aware of the need to grow solar power, so they
have set up promotion areas. The message is: "If you are going to [create a solar
project], please do it here, and if you do, then we can conduct all the procedures in
one place.”

Meanwhile, some municipalities want to declare themselves as zero-carbon cities. For
them, it’s better if they can oversee a disciplined development [of solar] that is not
overdone and is concentrated in a certain area. I think that approach works well for all
parties.

We are aware that we need a considerable amount of solar capacity, so we, METI, and
other ministries, are doing our best to find a spot for it in every possible place: at
airports, public facilities, and schools. Roughly 60% of new houses will have solar
panels in the future.


NUCLEAR
The latest Strategic Energy Plan has kept the nuclear target unchanged, yet this looks
challenging in practice. What policies do you have in mind to achieve it?

Nuclear, together with renewables, is the only CO2-free power source that can
provide stable electricity supply at scale, at the moment. That's why the new Strategic
Energy Plan adopted the policy that nuclear energy should be utilized at the
necessary scale as we aim for the 2050 target. I think this implies it will be difficult to
achieve the right energy mix without nuclear power unless other energy sources,
including renewable energy sources, get technologically advanced and become much
more affordable.

For the foreseeable future, the first thing we need to do is restart the reactors that
passed the Nuclear Regulation Authority safety review. Through this, people will
gradually realize that with nuclear power in operation, the electricity prices of utilities
that operate nuclear power plants remains relatively stable even when the price of
LNG fluctuates.

We are working to restore public trust in nuclear power in an environment in which
accidents are not tolerated. We need to obtain public understanding of the
significance of nuclear power. I think it would be good if we can deepen the debate
surrounding nuclear power, step by step.


CARBON PRICE
METI and MoE have examined the issue of carbon pricing and carbon tax for several
years. When do you expect to form a final decision?

Both our and MoE!s study groups have considered carbon pricing based on the same
source materials. There are two types of carbon pricing: Implicit and explicit. The FIT
system belongs to the former. Oil and coal taxes are partly an explicit price. Both MoE
and METI have a common understanding within our respective study groups that we
already have a system of economic tools linked to carbon and that if we are to

14


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

implement carbon pricing further, we need to do so in a way that contributes to
economic growth.

In the tax system debate [within government] at the end of the year, the discussion
tends to focus on whether or not to include a carbon tax. Tax is certainly one option
among many. There is also the trading of emission credits. And there is the private
sector's voluntary initiative that METI’s Industrial Science and Technology Policy and
Environment Bureau is considering, in which private entities pledge emission cuts and
then conduct a review of their progress. In that initiative, if one misses its target, they
have to procure carbon credits, which include credits from others who overachieve
their goal. We are still in the process of discussing how to implement various
mechanisms in a way that contributes to economic growth. I don't think we have yet
decided on the best direction.

Is there any deadline for the discussion about carbon pricing?

None. But we are aware of the timing of the EU's move on CBAM and its content, and
how that may change the environment. I don't mean that Japan should do something
just because the EU is doing it. If Japan is going to do something, we need to make
sure we can explain it to industry and the Japanese people, to show that it’s a
necessary course of action for decarbonization and that it will contribute to growth,
rather than being yet another burden.

Still, we can't remain apart from moves overseas. What will Europe do? Or what will
China do? What will the United States do? I think this is something we always need to
monitor and think about as our domestic discussions proceed.


BATTERIES
When do you expect storage batteries to play a significant role in the power sector of
Japan?

The more renewable energy is connected to the grid, the more important batteries
become. The only and major drawback is that batteries are expensive. At the moment,
pumped-storage hydro is the common way to balance supply and demand. Unless
batteries become cheaper than pumped-storage, they will not become widespread.
We are developing various technologies to make batteries as cheaply as possible so
that their cost is equivalent to pumped-storage systems, which means around ¥23,000
per kilowatt.

As for when this will happen, that’s a very hard question. This is a field that everyone
around the world thinks is important and is researching. We will continue to provide
industry with our strong support.


GREEN STEEL
The government is providing financing for R&D into steelmaking that moves away
from use of coal. Why is this an important program; what are your expectations for it?

This is one of the initiatives covered in the Green Growth Strategy that was published
in December 2020 and updated in June 2021. The financing is coming from a ¥2
trillion fund that METI set up, called the Green Innovation Fund. This fund’s assistance

15


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

will cover a range of projects from R&D through to demonstrations to social
implementation of the outcomes. We're organizing projects within the priority fields
for which implementation plans have been formulated as part of the Green Growth
Strategy, where policy effects are significant, and where long-term continuous support
is required to realize social implementation. We’re calling for applicants for each
project.

Certainly, ‘green steel’ is one of the key areas covered by the Fund. If you count the
amount of money that has been invested in this technology to date, it's quite large.
But, as you know, we are pursuing this research without knowing whether it really can
be done or not, especially in terms of iron production. Still, we can't stop ourselves
from trying. We can't see the goal line yet, but we are working hard on this field.


POWER MARKET LIBERALIZATION
In the past, the power market in Japan was controlled by 10 or 11 companies. Thanks
to the market liberalization, today there are hundreds of players. How has the
government adapted to communicating with such a large number of stakeholders?

That!s a very important question. The people who reformed the system didn't think at
the time that 500 or 600 companies would enter the electricity business.

Since the electricity retail and generation markets where liberalized companies can
enter and leave the market freely. This has created some issues. In the case of power
generation, for example, the notification system used to be “after the fact”. But, [with
a more diverse and complex generation system] we should make it a “before the
event” system, otherwise trouble could occur and there could be a shortage of
capacity all over Japan.

As for the retail business, the registration system for new players is still open, so any
interested company can apply. If they decide to quit, however, they should do so in a
way that causes as little trouble as possible to their customers. We’ve seen some
companies exit the retail sector. Given what’s happened in the UK [over recent
months, when several power retail firms went bankrupt due to price volatility], it’s
possible that more companies will quit this sector.

Last winter, [when electricity prices in Japan spiked to a record and were volatile for
several weeks] we felt that we needed to communicate with each individual power
retailer to find out what issues they were facing, their electricity procurement status,
and whether or not there was any room for the government to support them. We did
this, but it was very difficult to communicate with hundreds of companies all at once.
Officials worked hard even on their days off.

Since then, we’ve become more organized. The department in charge of retail has
informed retail companies how to hedge against the possibility of the same issues
recurring. We have been providing information and answering questions on this topic
for about a year now. We try to provide the right information as proactively as
possible, and we hope that companies will make use of it.

ANALYSIS

BY MARIE TANAO

Upset Over Offshore Wind Tenders Makes
Japan Govt. Reconsider Process, May Delay New Projects

Japan’s first-ever, fixed-bottom offshore wind tenders were swept by a Mitsubishi
Corporation led consortium that offered record low prices. The results caused surprise
and even shock in the industry. Whilst the winning price may become the catalyst for
the beginning of competitive pricing of offshore wind power generation in Japan, it
may cause challenges for diverse participation in future auctions in a still nascent
market. Now, METI Minister Hagiuda has signaled that the framework to select
auction winners may be reconsidered or at least adjusted to accommodate some of
the concerns.

The minister’s comments, if taken at face value, would require time-consuming
changes to regulation; thus, future tenders for offshore wind projects could be
affected and even delayed.

Energy experts close to the government have given a mixed reaction to the results
announced at the close of 2021, when tenders for all three sites were won by
consortiums led by Mitsubishi Corporation and a unit of Chubu Electric.

The other auction from the first round of offshore wind tenders, for a floating turbine
project off the coast of Nagasaki, was awarded in June 2021 to an all-Japan
consortium led by Toda Corporation that made the only bid.

Experts clash on results
Japanese academics who serve on relevant METI and MLIT2 committees that are vital
to offshore wind policy seem to be split on the clean sweep by Mitsubishi and C-Tech
Corp. The latter is a unit of Chubu Electric Group that’s mainly involved in power

facilities construction, maintenance, and data analytics. C-Tech independently
operates just 57 MW of wind capacity, all onshore, across three Japan projects, the
two biggest ones of which were built over a decade ago.

Yamaka Kimio, a distinguished professor at Kyoto University, and an analyst of
domestic offshore wind development, went as far as to suggest3 that the tender
results should be reconsidered. Calling the choice of tender winners as especially
sensitive, Yamaka voiced concern about the profile of the Mitsubishi consortium and
called their low bids a “gamble”, pointing to the feasibility of such a project in a still
developing market. The outcome will “go down in history as one of the first energy
projects to introduce international mentality” to tenders in Japan that give no
“consideration of the existing systems or the consensus of the parties involved,”
Yamaka said.

A more favorable view came from Professor Matsumura Toshihiro of Tokyo University,
who periodically appeared before government committees. Matsumura highlighted
the unexpectedly low bids submitted by Mitsubishi as proof that offshore wind can be
competitive with existing generation types and a chance to sway skeptics of the
emerging energy source.

The sentiment was echoed by fellow University of Tokyo professor, Takamura Yukari, a
big proponent of the energy transition, who called the cost-competitive nature of the
winning bid an encouraging sign for Japan hitting its 2030 GHG reduction goals.

Indeed, Mitsubishi’s ability to offer as little as ¥11.99/ kWh in one of the tenders is
said to have been the big draw for the government’s decision. METI is particularly
sensitive to the issue of the “renewables surcharge”, the markup on the Japanese
power bill that covers the cost of the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) system introduced in 2012 to
stimulate the development of renewables.

METI emphasized the issue of cost numerous times during committee discussions that
led to the current offshore wind auction framework.


Can METI reconfigure the auction process?
Since the publication of the government’s Vision for Offshore Power Industry and the
Green Growth Strategy in December 2020, Japan’s goal has been to bring the cost of
offshore wind electricity generation to ¥8-9/ kWh by 2030-2035 and to award winners
10 GW worth of projects by FY2030.

The first four auctions awarded last year would bring online just over 1.7 GW of
capacity. This year’s auction in the Happo and Noshiro area in Akita Prefecture would
add close to 0.36 GW. This would leave METI with eight years in which to stage 8 GW
of tenders and award them.

To hit the cost targets, however, the government needs to act faster since projects
awarded now would not come online for another eight years or so. That suggests
within the next five years winning project bids need to drop to the ¥8-9 level.

The Mitsubishi consortium’s ¥11.99-16.49/ kWh bids, which is rumored to be as much

as ¥5 less than the nearest rival in some of the tenders, helps the government set the
right marker to achieve its roadmap goals. Nevertheless, METI wants to keep most of
the industry onside and cannot be seen playing favorites.

As such, METI Minister Hagiuda was cited in the media as saying that the government
will consider “an alternative framework for selecting auctions winners” to counter the
likely backlash from many in the industry.

The current rules are enshrined in law, specifically the “Act on Promoting the
Utilization of Sea Areas for the Development of Marine Renewable Energy Power
Generation Facilities,” which lays out the flow from designation of development zone
to auction winner selection. Still, details around how to implement the process are in
the hands of METI, MLIT and other ministries via two sets of guidelines.

Although the government would not need to change the law, ministries would have to
alter the two sets of guidelines – a process that typically requires additional
committee sessions. Expert deliberation takes months. Finally, the changes would
need to be incorporated in the guidelines, likely published for public review and
feedback, and only then become active.

The process is possible, but if enacted, likely to take time. Meanwhile, all new tenders
would have to be put on hold.

Of course, METI could take the cost issue out of the hands of the bidders and simply
set a price, as with the floating turbine auction in Nagasaki Prefecture. Then, bidders
would be evaluated purely on their ability to carry out the project. Such an approach
would not be applicable to the next auction, for the Happo and Noshiro area in Akita
Prefecture, the terms of which have already been announced.

Another option is for the bid prices to carry a smaller weighting in the overall
assessment.

The result of the Happo and Noshiro area auction is expected in December 2022. If
the METI minister follows through on his comments, however, the timeline could shift
and the rollout of additional sites will be affected.

This may prove a delicate balance for the government: adjusting the auction
framework so a diverse set of players can participate whilst trying to keep offshore
wind generation costs competitive. Close monitoring of relevant METI and MLIT
committee discussions going forward will be vital to those interested in future auction
participation as they will likely shape the changes in the framework. This also sends a
signal that the auction framework is not set in stone, and there are opportunities for
potential players to advocate for change.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Italy/ Solar power
NextEnergy Capital divested its solar portfolio in Italy that was part of its NextPower II
fund established in 2016. The deal’s value wasn’t revealed. The fund’s portfolio had
105 individual solar facilities with a total capacity of 149 MW. The company recently
set up NextPower III, a solar infrastructure fund that exceeded the $750 million
fundraising target.

Offshore wind battery storage
A sea-bottom, offshore energy storage system was unveiled at CES 2022 in Las Vegas,
potentially a game changer, says the developer, Dutch startup Ocean Grazer. In a
statement, it said: the “battery allows utilities to transform offshore wind farms into
dispatchable power generators using hydro dam technology” that can be deployed at
the source of power generation.

Czechia/ Coal and nuclear power
The new government pledged to phase out coal by 2033, and will compensate for the
loss by increasing capacity for nuclear power and renewables. Coal-fired power plants
currently generate about 50% of Czech electricity output.

UK/ Nuclear power
EDF Energy will speed up closure of Heysham 2, a nuclear power station operational
since 1988. Instead of a planned closure in 2030, Heysham 2 will now close in 2028.
Meanwhile, Heysham 1 will cease operations in 2024, as planned. The UK has 11
nuclear reactors at five locations; they produce 20% of the country’s electricity.

Italy/ Fossil fuels
Italian energy services group Saipem won offshore contracts worth a total of $1.1
billion. The first contract is for connecting Scarborough gas field with an onshore plant
in the Carnarvon Basin, off Western Australia; its first cargo is expected in 2026.
Saipem’s second contract is with a subsidiary of ExxonMobil for a project off Guyana’s
coast.

U.S./ Wind power
A 1 GW wind farm in the state of New Mexico began operation. Developed by
Pattern Energy Group, “Western Spirit” is called the largest renewable energy project
in the U.S. The four wind power facilities rely on 377 GE wind turbines that range from
2.3 to 2.8 MW.

U.S./ Oil
Oil production could break pre-pandemic records in 2023, thwarting President Biden’s
goal to transition away from fossil fuels. Output is likely to rise to 12.4 mbd in 2023,
said the Energy Information Administration. U.S. natural gas production will also set
records over the next two years. The EIA added that OPEC is expected to increase
crude oil production to 28.9 mbd in 2023, up from an average of 26.3 mbd in 2021.

Russia/ Gas
The head of the International Energy Agency accused Russia of slowing gas supplies
to Europe to create an energy crisis as part of a geopolitical ploy. The context is that
Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned gas company, wants approval for the start-up of the
Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany, which is an alternative to pipeline transit routes
via Ukraine.

U.S./ energy storage
Tesla unveiled its Megapack battery project in Texas that has a capacity of 100 MW/
200 MWh. It’s one of Tesla’s biggest energy storage projects. Last winter, unexpected
harsh weather resulted in many parts of Texas having blackouts.

Philippines/ Offshore wind
Spain’s Iberdrola and Triconti ECC Renewables, the Philippines ’largest wind
developer, plan to build five offshore wind projects with a combined capacity of up to
3.5 GW. The Philippines has a target of 35% renewable energy in its power mix by
2030, and 50% share by 2040.

UK/ Offshore Wind
EDF Renewables will work with DP Energy to build offshore wind capacity from
floating turbines of up to 1 GW. The project, Gwynt Glas, is planned to be off the
coast of Wales. It’s expected to be operational starting in 2030.

Canada/Renewables
Blackstone Inc. will invest $3 billion in Canada’s clean energy company, Invenergy,
which has 190 clean energy projects across the globe with a total installed capacity of
29 GW.
