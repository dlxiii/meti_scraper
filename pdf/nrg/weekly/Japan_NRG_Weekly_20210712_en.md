NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Discussions around new Basic Energy Plan near completion

(Various, July 8)
•  Govt. discussions for updated Basic Energy Plan now in final stage.
•  METI plan to present a draft on July 21.
•  Next, open the plan to public comments from mid-Sept and complete debates in time for the
Cabinet to give final approval at end of Oct.
•  The schedule is set with COP26 UN conference in Nov. in mind.
•  Language around use of nuclear will be to “continue using it at the required level” while talk of

new plants to replace existing, aging reactors has been dropped. Nuclear’s ratio in the power mix
will remain at around 20-22% by 2030.
•  Use of renewables will be expanded as much possible in line with the national decarbonization
policy. Renewables’ ratio in the power mix will rise to 36-38% by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: The timing of publication for the Plan seems to change weekly if not daily, but several reports
across the major daily newspapers indicate the latest information is coming from ministry sources. The
numbers on nuclear and renewables are not surprising at this point and have been reported several times

previously.


Government publishes renewables capacity targets for 2030

(Japan NRG, July 6)
•  A METI panel released a forecast for renewables capacities in FY2030. It puts solar capacity at 74
GW but notes there’s room to expand it to 88 GW by introducing key performance indicators for
policies to accelerate the development.
•  MoE says Japan can also gain 6 GW from adding solar panels to half of the nation’s public
buildings, another 10 GW from panels on buildings owned by private businesses, parking lots, and

other non-housing facilities, and 4.1 GW from solar installations on public land across 1,000 towns
and cities of Japan.
•  On wind, METI sees onshore capacity climbing to 13-15 GW by 2030, up from about 4 GW today.
•  Installed offshore wind is seen at 1.7-3.7 GW by 2030, up from a tiny amount today. This offshore
expansion will depend on operators managing to develop their projects in line with the national
offshore wind strategy.
•  Hydro power is seen at 50.7 GW maximum in 2030, little changed from 50 GW today.
•  Biomass is seen rising to 7.3 GW from around 4.5 GW.




MoE minister Koizumi keen on renewables grant idea

(Nikkei, July 6)
•  Minister of the Environment Koizumi Shinjiro is interested in creating a scheme to pay local bodies

Environment Ministry studies how global warming changes typhoon impacts
(Japan NRG, July 2)
•  MoE released a report on how the rise in temperatures impacts typhoons. The study compiled
simulations of typhoons in 2019 and resulted in numbers that show water flow in eight major rivers

of Japan could increase by 15% on average if temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius, and by 29%
if the rise is 4 degrees.
•  The possibility of floods in smaller rivers increases by 1.44 times for a 2-degree rise, and 2.28 times
from a 4-degree rise.
•  Water depth in Tokyo Bay was seen increasing by 5% on a 2-degree rise; 13% on a 4-degree rise.
•  This shows that river infrastructure must be strengthened to protect from stormwater.




Roadmap to zero emission sea and air vessels released by project group
(Japan NRG, July 8)
•  The Green Innovation Project group of Industry Structure Council released road maps for
developing zero emission sea and air vessels.
•  Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism plans to develop zero emission sea vessels

that run on hydrogen and ammonia engines, as well as a technology to prevent methane leakage
from LNG-powered vessels.
•  Hydrogen engines and their peripherals plan trial runs starting in 2027, with ammonia engines and
peripherals a little earlier around in 2025.
•  Methane leakage systems on LNG-fueled ships will start tests in early 2024.
•  METI aims to establish core technologies for hydrogen-powered aircrafts by 2030, and to develop

new material that realizes 30% weight reduction by 2035.



MoE commissioned study confirms that changing consumer behavior can cut CO2 emissions
(New Energy Business News, July 5)
•  A trial conducted between 2017 and 2020 by Oracle Japan and energy efficiency consultants at
the Jyukankyo Research Institute applied the ‘nudge’ theory pioneered by U.S. economist Richard

Thaler and succeeded in reducing CO2 emissions by 47,000 metric tons.
•  The trial was commissioned by the MoE.
•  In the trial, 300,000 subscribers to Hokkaido Gas, Tohoku Electric, Hokuriku Electric, KEPCO, and
Okinawa Electric used the service to monitor their energy use. Energy savings averaged 2%.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The parties will study the potential to create a clean ammonia supply chain in UAE, which will
involve capturing CO2 at the production site and sequestering emissions. The ammonia would be
transported to Japan.
•  The captured CO2 could also be injected into ADNOC oil and gas fields to boost output. INPEX is
a co-investor in some of ADNOC’s oil fields.

•  A feasibility study will be conducted through November.



BlackRock to launch $500M green infrastructure fund in Asia
(Nikkei Asia, July 5)
•  BlackRock will launch a ¥55 billion ($500 million) fund in order to develop infrastructure for the

transportation of green energy in emerging markets.
•  The fund is named Climate Finance Partnership and will be in collaboration with state agencies and
private financial institutions from Japan, Germany and France. The goal is to encourage
developing countries to accelerate initiatives to tackle climate change.
•  The fund will invest in infrastructure projects in Asia, Latin America and Africa. BlackRock will
coordinate the fund.
•  CONTEXT: BlackRock is one of the world's largest investment management companies.




Norway’s Yara interested in supplying green ammonia to Japan
(Nikkei Asia, July 8)
•  Norway's Yara International, one of the world's top fertilizer companies, plans to produce ammonia
using solar energy in Australia and export it to Japan, said CEO Svein Tore Holsether.
•  The company aims to set up a supply chain for ammonia, which does not emit CO2 when burned.

•  Yara is working with French electric utility Engie in the ammonia project in western Australia's
Pilbara region.
•  Yara hopes to start small-scale production of 3,700 tons by end of 2023.
•  Also, JERA has agreed with Yara to look at whether it's feasible to produce "blue ammonia" --
created from natural gas, but with the CO2 captured and stored -- at the Pilbara plant.
•  CONTEXT: Yara, which has 17 ammonia plants worldwide, also plans to produce "green

ammonia" in Norway and Netherlands.



Daikin develops a refrigerant for EVs that can boost range by up to 50%
(Nikkei, July 7）
•  Daikin Industries, Japan's top air conditioner maker, has developed a refrigerant for EVs that
extends their range by up to 50%. The company plans to commercialize the product by 2025.

•  Air conditioners use heat generated by compressing the refrigerant to heat and cool the air inside
the car. Daikin's new refrigerant has a boiling point of about minus 40 C, which is 10 to 15 degrees
lower than the conventional product. This reduces the power required for compression.

Solar Farms in the Eye of the Storm: Mudslide Unearths Local Concerns
•  Only a few weeks ago Japan’s most controversial energy source was nuclear, with furious debates
inside government and business about the need to continue supporting the industry. Now, much
of the concern has shifted to solar power.

•  How does this fit with announcements about national targets to boost solar capacity? It doesn’t.
But, as we noted in the June 28 edition, national policy is increasingly at odds with on-the-ground
developments. Unless this is resolved, the 2030 projections simply won’t materialize.
•  The spark for the current solar debate came after a natural disaster at the popular hot springs
resort town of Atami on July 3. Several days of heavy rain led to a landslide -- a massive mud
avalanche that rolled down the hillside killing at least four people. More than 80 people are still

missing and there is damaged to homes and roads.
• Atami lies 90 km southwest of Tokyo.
• The cause seems to have been the
collapse of a landfill high up in the
mountains that was made to create land
for new development.
• Although the development of a solar

project in the town was not named as the
direct cause of this disaster, forest clearing
and land development in mountainous
areas for projects such as solar farms were
identified as aggravating the severity of
such natural disasters.
• Just a week before the mudslide, a top

daily, the Mainichi, published results of a
survey showing that 80% of Japan’s 47
prefectures claim to have experienced

problems with solar development. One of the issues cited is the “destructive impact on the
environment” from solar.
•  Two days after the disaster, the left-leaning newspaper, Asahi, published a rather skeptical editorial
also questioning the economic costs of renewables.
•  Even Bloomberg Japan published an article to show how Japan has more solar panels per square

kilometer than any other economy, and how this is creating a sense of limitation to further utility-
scale development.
•  The Atami disaster is not just a media topic – it’s already impacting projects. Ito, a neighbor city to
Atami, last week rejected a solar project proposal, citing local opposition. It mentioned the Atami
disaster in its commentary.
•  Other cities are appealing to lawmakers to gain more control over renewable energy project

operators, which will at the very least push up the cost of doing business for utility-scale solar.
•  The issue may be as “simple” as setting up clear no-go zones for solar projects to reassure the
local population that developments are not taking place on land that is at risk.
•  Fair or not, the solar industry in Japan is in the eye of the storm and must adapt to changing public
opinion and any new regulations that might follow.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Ministry of Environment to enact ordinance to stop solar projects in risky areas

(Denki Shimbun, July 9)
o  MoE will enact a new ordinance to prevent the construction of solar power generation on
land at risk of sediment-related disasters. This will reference the Global Warming
Countermeasures Promotion Law and show which areas are suitable for solar projects.
o  The move will encourage businesses to closely study land created by embankments and
on natural slopes where the risk of landslides is greatest.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

80% of Japan's 47 prefectures have problems with solar power plants
(Mainichi, June 28, reprinted in English on July 4)
o  A Mainichi Shimbun survey found that of all 47 prefectures in Japan, 80% have some kind
of problem with solar power.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Ito City cancels solar project citing residents opposition

(Mainichi, June 8)
o  Ito City in Shizuoka prefecture announced the construction plan for a large-scale solar
power plant in the Yawatano area.
o  The city has been embroiled in a debate with the solar project developer, including in
the courts, over permissions to move heavy machinery to the project site, as well as other
issues.

o  Rejecting the project outright, the local mayor said Japan needs new regulation to
govern developments in the mountain areas, especially in light of the landslide in the
nearby city of Atami.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kada Yukiko visits controversial solar site
(Asahi Shimbun, July 5)
o  Independent Diet member Kada Yukiko visited the planned site of a solar farm in Shiga

that faces local opposition.

11


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Residents’ groups say Japan’s laws limit demands that can be made on solar operators,
and are calling for more regulation.
o  Solar panels will be erected on the 7,600 m² site by end of September.
o  Kada will study the issue further before considering a response.
o  CONTEXT: Kada is a very well-known environmentalist and a former two-term governor

of Shiga prefecture. She is in her first term as a lower house lawmaker.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Causal relations between solar panels and landslides
(Toyo Keizai, July 10)
o  Author Kono Hiroko points out that in the push to have more land available for solar and
wind, the government did not provide any guidance over land that should be off-limits

because of natural disaster risk. That leaves locals wary of accepting solar projects
because they do not feel like such factors have been properly vetted.
o  Some localities have taken it upon themselves to put some restrictions in place to protect
land that might be at risk. However, it is not clear whether these ordinances are
appropriate within the current legal framework. Also, from the outside, such ordinances
may look as if localities are against all solar and wind projects, as opposed to being
protective over which land gets used.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hosono Goshi pledges investigation into solar farms’ role in landslide
(Nikkan Sports, July 4)
o  Shizuoka Diet member and former Environment Minister Hosono Goshi took to social
media to call for an investigation into the link between solar farms on the Izu peninsula
and the landslide in Atami on July 3.

o  Hosono is trying to stop a new solar farm in neighboring Kannami.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
The rocky road to carbon neutrality
(Asahi Shimbun editorial, July 5)
o  Japan’s pledge to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 will require widescale
adoption of renewable energy.

o  The govt. wants to source over 35% of energy from renewable sources by 2030. Since it’s
not possible to install so much offshore wind capacity in a short time, solar energy is the
hope to achieve the target.
o  METI, however, says that even if solar panels are installed on the roof of every house,
block of flats, factory, and commercial premises built in the next nine years, we’ll still be
nowhere near to achieving this goal. Extensive new solar farms are also required.
o  Sourcing half of our electricity needs from renewable sources by 2050 is also expected to

double the cost of electricity.
o  Instead of only talking about the role that renewables can play in economic growth, the
govt. needs to explain the harsh realities of a transition to renewables for both businesses
and households.

Japan and India See Complementary Energy Strategies
Signaling Partnership in Hydrogen Development

Japan wants to create a carbon-free hydrogen supply chain. India plans to more than triple
its renewables capacity within this decade, which could create a surplus of energy that
could be diverted to producing hydrogen.

The two national strategies are potentially complementary, and both sides are starting to
take note. For India, traditionally a buyer of energy-related fuels, this opens the door to
large-scale energy exports. For Japan, it’s a way to diversify the geography of its hydrogen
supply and secure new providers in a country with which it already enjoys a strong energy
relationship.

As 2030 is widely forecast to be when the cost of making hydrogen from renewables
starts to be cost-competitive with its manufacture from fossil fuels, India’s green wave
could play a major role for Japan and the broader Asia region.


Known quantities
Japan and India already enjoy a strong relationship in energy, holding regular
meetings at the ministerial and working-group level. Also, ministers from both
countries attend a Japan-Indian Energy Dialog every few years, and, recently, on an
annual basis.

There are also numerous task forces with experts and officials from both countries
looking at smart grids, energy storage, energy efficiency and methanation, among
others. Hydrogen entered the conversation in 2019, via a Workshop on Hydrogen and
Fuel Cells, held in Delhi to exchange information and find ways to work together for
“mutual cooperation in this field”, according to comments at the time posted by
Japan’s METI.
The workshop, and subsequent intergovernmental meetings, focused specifically on
cost-competitive applications of the fuel for transport, industry, as well as regulations
and standards needed for the hydrogen industry. Recently, however, the dialog has
evolved to the topic of production.

At an online event in April, officials and experts from India and Japan spoke positively
about a “perfect alignment” for working together in green hydrogen. The two
countries should pour investment into R&D and commercialization of lower cost
hydrogen production, was one of the conclusions from the webinar hosted by the
Embassy of India in Tokyo in collaboration with India’s Department of Science and
Technology (DST), IGES (The Japanese Institute for Global Environmental Strategies)
and TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute).


Government policy
In 2017, Japan was the first country to unveil a comprehensive hydrogen policy, and
last year it unveiled what was then the world’s largest green hydrogen manufacturing
facility in Fukushima.

India’s progress in hydrogen has been slower, but in the 2021-22 budget the
government announced a Hydrogen Mission – a $15 billion initiative to reduce the
nation’s dependence on fossil fuels and lower the economy's carbon footprint through
use of hydrogen.

Further, the MNRE (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy) is recommending that
India creates four integrated hydrogen hubs, which would introduce long-haul
hydrogen buses and other hydrogen transport options. Other proposed measures
include facilitating open access to renewable energy, and support to lower the cost of
production at these hydrogen hubs.
So far, India’s DST has put funding to around 30 projects related to the production,
transportation, and storage of hydrogen with a focus on discovering new catalysts to
perform electrolysis.

Among the Indian companies involved are Tata Motors, which has launched a
hydrogen fuel cell bus in collaboration with Indian Oil and ISRO (Indian Space
Research Organisation). Indian Oil and NTPC (National Thermal Power Corporation)
are interested in setting up pilot hydrogen production units. A group that includes
Mahindra & Mahindra has developed and tested two/three wheelers and mini buses
running on hydrogen fuel.

Reliance Industries Ltd., the largest private company in India, has said that hydrogen
applications in transport and power will be one of the components of its plan to to
achieve carbon neutrality by 2035.



Low-cost renewables rollout is key
The biggest ace for India in rolling out
green hydrogen is the country’s low cost
of renewables. Solar tariffs have declined
to (¥2.95 / ₹1.99 rupees per kWh). That’s
at least three times cheaper than in Japan.

Further price drops should make India a
net exporter of hydrogen from 2030,
according to the Global Hydrogen
Council.
Co-chairs of the 10th Japan-India Energy Dialogue, Minister
Kajiyama and H.E. Mr. Raj Kumar Singh, Minister of State for At present, India consumes 6 million tons
Power, and New and Renewable Energy. Source: METI of hydrogen (about 8.5% of global
demand) as a chemical feedstock by
reforming 18 million tons of import-
dependent natural gas.

These hydrogen volumes will rise once India’s renewables expansion plans
materialize. The country already has 136 GW of capacity that it classifies as renewable
energy, according to the office of PM Modi. By 2030, that number is expected to be
at 450 GW.

The business case
Japanese companies may be involved in that Indian renewables drive. Although the
SoftBank Group has recently sold out of its Indian solar venture, SB Energy, another
major Japanese investor in green power, Orix Group, spent about $980 million earlier
in 2021 to buy 22% of Indian renewable energy firm Greenko Energy Holdings.

Other Japanese corporates active in the Indian market, such as Suzuki, Toyota, Honda
and Mitsubishi Corp, and Hitachi also have interest in energy or CO2-free mobility,
and may branch out to renewables and / or hydrogen. Trading house Mitsubishi Corp
in particular has a strong LNG sales business in India and could deploy some of its
local LNG infrastructure for the hydrogen supply chain.

So far, Japan’s efforts in building out the global hydrogen supply chain have focused
on countries with which it has an existing strong energy relationship, such as Australia
and Saudi Arabia. India looks a likely candidate to join that list.

One Country, Two Power Systems: How Japan Plans to Improve

Grid Connections to Aid Renewables Rollout

Japan is the only major economy globally to use two power frequencies in its
electricity grid. The nation!s system is split between a 60Hz zone in the east and a
50Hz zone in the west, which is a major issue for transferring electricity around the
country.

To move electricity from one frequency zone to another requires conversion facilities,
which currently have a relatively low capacity. In time of natural disaster, this
bottleneck has even led to a blackout in eastern Japan.

As Japan increases its intermittent and decentralized renewable energy capacity, such
grid weaknesses can no longer be ignored. Grid resiliency is key to maximizing the
integration of more wind and solar assets, and limiting their curtailment.

To this end, Japan has started to create a Master Plan to overcome the issue.

Japan!s Frequency Converter Facilities

Strengthening Japan!s Power Grid
A total of 9.7 GW of power generation capacity was lost in eastern Japan after the
devastating 2011 earthquake. The frequency converter capacity between the Tokyo
and Chubu zones was only 1.0 GW, thus capping how much power could be provided
from western to eastern Japan. Since then, the capacity has increased to 2.1 GW and
it will reach 3.0 GW by 2027.

Power markets in Japan would gain much more if that capacity were bolstered even
further.

Current government strategy is committed to boosting the share of renewables in the
power mix. As more decentralized generation such as solar and wind is installed,
however, there needs to be more flexibility in transmission. The grid needs to be
redeveloped to allow upstream power flow, which would include allowing excess solar
power from one region to pass to another.

The burden of managing such distribution falls on the Organization for Cross-regional
Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO), which aims to devise an
interconnector master plan, due to be completed in FY2022. A preliminary draft of the
plan was recently published.

Four Scenarios
OCCTO is working on the basis of four different development scenarios for Japan,
based on different expectations around new renewables capacity and also
expectations around how far that capacity will be from the country!s main demand
centers.

An OCCTO expert committee compared these four scenarios to quantitatively analyze
the needs for interconnector capacity increases over the next 30 years. This analysis
will be used to refine the Master Plan, but will also serve as a blueprint for work in the
near term.

Results of OCCTO!s Simulations
Developing half the target offshore wind capacity in high-consumption areas would
reduce the grid reinforcement cost by 60%–65%, from ¥2.3–3.1 trillion to ¥1.5–1.7
trillion. This, however, does not account for the asset connection costs that asset
owners will have to shoulder, nor does it account for differences in asset construction
costs.

In Scenario 3, the interconnection reinforcement costs would be 32%–37% lower than
for Scenario 1.

OCCTO also performed a benefit-to-cost ratio analysis by evaluating the generator
and consumer benefits of the interconnector upgrades. Only Scenario 4 shows a
benefit-to-cost ratio lower than 1 under some conditions because there’d be such a
high volume of renewable assets across the country that interconnection capacity
usage would decrease, according to OCCTO. The ratio increases with the power
demand.

In Scenario 4, as more intermittent renewable assets are introduced, their curtailment
rate jumps to 39% (42% without interconnector upgrades). This is conspicuously high
and proves the need for a strategy of adding storage or shifting consumption to
integrate these assets into the energy system.


OCCTO!s Preliminary Recommendations
Based on the current analysis, OCCTO is suggesting that the Japanese government
modify its policy for offshore wind to encourage projects closer to power demand
centers. This would save ¥2–3 trillion in interconnector upgrade costs.

It also recommends taking measures on the demand side to optimize renewable
energy consumption by, for instance, connecting assets to batteries or electrolyzers.
This would increase the benefit-to-cost ratio in Scenario 4.

At this stage, OCCTO has already identified high-priority interconnector
reinforcement projects that could be started immediately and would profit all
scenarios.

OCCTO!s analysis underscores the need for a national strategy to better integrate
renewable generation into the system. As OCCTO recommends bringing generation
capacity closer to demand areas, the government is already planning to encourage
high power consumption activity in regional cities. The initiative would, for instance,
provide financial support for companies and municipalities to establish data centers in
a decentralized manner in roughly five regional cities.

Perhaps the greatest challenge highlighted by this exercise comes in Scenario 4. It
shows that with high penetration of intermittent generation, a significant amount of
the power produced would be lost if storage or demand response does not take
place. If the economics of storage do not make sense by this timeline, it raises the
question of whether renewable projects can reasonably be developed with a
curtailment risk near 40%.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Hydropower:
Severe droughts in California have reduced hydroelectric generation by 1 GW,
pushing up prices for coal-fired power. The California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) is trying to secure emergency electricity supplies from outside the state.

Railways:
In the U.S., Amtrak awarded a $7.3 billion order to Siemens Mobility to replace railcars
with dual-powered battery hybrid environmentally-friendly locomotives in the largest
single order in Amtrak’s 50-year history.

EVs:
1). The EU Commission is considering legislation mandating that all new car sales by
2035 must be zero CO2 emissions.
2). Stellantis will invest $35 billion over the next four years developing EVs.
3). VW and BMW have been fined over $1 billion by the EU for colluding to prevent
deployment of clean emissions technology.

E-Bicycles:
Bosch predicts that 50% of bikes sold in Europe will have an electric motor by 2025
following a surge in sales during the pandemic.

E-Trucks:
Volvo, Daimler and Traton, the EU’s three largest truck makers, plan to roll out a
superfast $600 million electric charging network for haulage vehicles, creating 1,700
charging stations across Europe.

Oil:
1). OPEC+ negotiations to increase oil production were abandoned last week with the
UAE refusing to endorse a 400,000 bpd production increase from August because of
disagreements over baseline calculations and quotas. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait
and Nigeria had their quotas revised in previous negotiations. The tough line adopted
by the UAE is regarded as one of the most significant shifts in oil policy in recent times
by a petrostate. UAE has around 50 years of reserves at current production levels.
2). Oil hedging losses in the U.S. may have hit $7.5 billion for shale producers in H1
2021 as many hedged oil sales at $55. Oil’s trading close to $75 at present. If current
prices persist, hedging losses for U.S. producers for FY2021 could hit $12 billion.
3). Paris will institute a 30 kph speed limit from the end of August to reduce pollution.

Natural Gas:
Global natural gas demand is expected to rise almost 4% in 2021 before easing to an
average growth rate of 1.7% over the following three years, according to the IEA’s
latest quarterly Gas Market Report. By 2024, demand will be up 7% vs 2019.
Natural gas demand growth in 2021 reflects economic recovery from Covid-19, but is
set to be driven in the following years by economic activity and by gas replacing other

| set to be driven in the following years by economic activity and by gas replacing other |

more polluting fuels such as coal and oil. Asia accounts for about 50% of the increase
in gas demand between 2020 and 2024.

Coal:
China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam are planning to build 600 coal plants that
could generate 300 GW of power according to a report last week by Carbon Tracker
warning that this could undermine the Paris Agreement.

Nuclear Power:
1). India’s Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) has been awarded a $190 million
contract by Nuclear Power Corporation of India to supply 12 steam generators for
domestically developed 700 MW pressurized heavy water reactors to be constructed
at four locations across India.
In May 2017, the cabinet approved the construction of ten 700 MW units to fast-track
India's nuclear power program. The reactors are to be built at four plant locations -
including two new sites - by 2031. Two of the reactors would be constructed as units 5
and 6 of the Kaiga nuclear power plant in Karnataka state; two as units 3 and 4 of the
Gorakhpur plant in Haryana state; two as units 1 and 2 of the new Chutka plant in
Madhya Pradesh; and four units at the new Mahi Banswara plant in Rajasthan.
2). Argentina’s Nucleoeléctrica Argentina SA will complete the construction of a
prototype small modular reactor, CAREM-25, under a contract signed with the
country's National Atomic Energy Commission. The contract specifies construction will
be completed within three years.
3). In the UK, Rolls-Royce and Cavendish Nuclear signed a MoU to cooperate on the
Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor program. Cavendish Nuclear will consider what
roles it can take in design, licensing, manufacturing and delivery of the small modular
reactors. The Rolls-Royce SMR Consortium already includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM
Nuttall, Laing O’Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, Jacobs, and others.

Carbon Capture & Storage (CCUS):
Only 20 commercial CCUS projects are currently operating globally, with plans for an
additional 30, according to recent analysis by the IEA. The current 20 projects capture
around 40 million tons of CO2. The IEA estimates this needs to increase to 800 million
tons by 2030 and 2.8 billion tons by 2050 under the terms of the Paris Agreement.
The ‘Coalition for Negative Emissions’ believes 1 billion tons needs to be removed
from the atmosphere by 2025 and 1 billion tons every year thereafter.

Methane Emissions:
The European Space Agency recently spotted a massive plume of methane emissions
in China’s largest coal region in Northeast Shanxi Province where 34 mines are based.

Climate Finance:
James Murdoch has committed $250 million to a BlackRock climate finance fund
focused on emerging markets.

2050 Net-Zero:
1). The EU is expected to propose 13 legislative measures for achieving net-zero CO2
emissions by 2050. The legislation will require approval by the EU parliament and the
27 members states.
2). The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, last
week called for an end to all permits, subsidies and financing for fossil fuels.

second-hand vessels and with 43 new ships on order. MSC has revenues of $25 billion
and 100,000 employees.

Switzerland:
Last week, an energy agreement between the EU and Switzerland governing grid
connections to the EU lapsed. Switzerland is scheduled to exit nuclear power by 2034
and may need to construct almost 1,000 wind turbines to improve energy self-
reliance.

| the $12.4 billion it raised from the sale of its U.S. oil pipeline business in April, and has |
| created a new team to review its assets. |
|  |
| Italy: |
| The Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is set to become the world’s largest |
| container group, by capacity, overtaking Moller-Maersk after the acquisition of 60 |
| second-hand vessels and with 43 new ships on order. MSC has revenues of $25 billion |
| and 100,000 employees. |
|  |
| Switzerland: |
| Last week, an energy agreement between the EU and Switzerland governing grid |
| connections to the EU lapsed. Switzerland is scheduled to exit nuclear power by 2034 |
| and may need to construct almost 1,000 wind turbines to improve energy self- |
| reliance. |

UK:
1). Landis+Gyr, the Swiss-based metering company, has been awarded a 20-year
contract by National Grid for a grid modernization project in the U.S.
2). Stellantis (Peugeot+Fiat) will manufacture electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant in
the UK investing $140 million.
3). Lotus, the UK sports carmaker owned by China’s Geely, unveiled its new but last-
ever petrol car last week.
4). The UK’s climate targets will cost the government less over the next 30 years than
the price of battling the Covid-19 pandemic if it acts quickly. Forecasts from the Office
for Budget Responsibility (OBR) show that ending the UK’s contribution to the global
climate crisis would add 21% of GDP to the national debt by 2050, or $650 billion. But
those costs could climb twice as high if the government delays action to cut
emissions. The independent spending forecasts found that taking early action to
decarbonize the economy would have a smaller net impact on the UK’s finances than
Covid or the 2008 financial crisis.
5). The north-east of England is in line for a green jobs windfall thanks to private
investment in the offshore wind industry backed by a grant from the government’s
$220 million support fund. The investment is expected to increase the UK’s offshore
wind manufacturing capacity by creating up to 1,000 jobs. The funding will help SeAH
Wind set up a $160 million factory to build offshore wind turbine foundations at the
Able Marine Energy Park, creating up to 750 direct jobs by 2030.

Canada:
TC Energy, the Canadian infrastructure company, which had its Keystone XL license
revoked by the U.S. government is seeking damages of $15 billion from the U.S.

U.S.:
1). Several oil companies, including Exxon, BP, and Shell have been asked to meet the
$7.2 billion of costs to cap used oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico following the
bankruptcy protection of Fleetwood Energy.
2). Heliogen, the concentrated solar power company founded by Bill Gross, will go
public through a SPAC with an expected valuation of over $2 billion.

Mexico:
1). Cemex, North America’s largest concrete producer, will cut CO2 emissions 40% in
its concrete by 2030 and become net-zero by 2050. The cuts are expected to be
produced mainly using renewable energy, carbon-capture and storage, and from
offset programs.
2). Pemex has been awarded control and operator status of the Zama offshore oil
field, one of Mexico’s biggest oil discoveries, beating Talos Energy, Premier Oil and
Wintershall. The Zama oilfield is thought to have 670 million barrels of oil reserves.

Chile:
The government constructed one of the world’s most ambitious plans for renewable
energy that spans wind power in southern Patagonia and solar power in the Atacama
Desert, with 40% of inbound Chilean FDI now directed at renewable energy. The
country is also focusing on green hydrogen and was recently voted the most attractive
renewable energy investment location in the world by a leading think tank.
