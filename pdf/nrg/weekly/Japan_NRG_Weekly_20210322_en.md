NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Japan industry association asks government to set a ¥5,000 ($46) carbon price

(Japan NRG, March 17)
•  A price of ¥5,000/ ton of CO2 emissions could boost the development of renewables outside of
the FIT system by 17%, according to Japan Climate Change Leadership Partnership (JCLP).
•  The comments were made in a March 16 presentation to METI, as part of the meeting of the Next
Generation Electricity Network Subcommittee.
•  JCLP is an association that consists of 175 companies, including domestic players such as Fujitsu,
Orix, Ricoh and Aeon, and overseas companies like Amazon and Google. The group is lobbying to

help increase use of renewable energy in Japan.



Government launches panel to plan submarine cables for offshore wind power transmission
(Japan NRG, March 21)
•  Last week local media reported that the government is considering the creation of an underwater
power grid to connect with the upcoming development of offshore wind power resources. Now,

the government has officially set up a committee to consider how to implement the idea.
•  This government panel held its inaugural meeting on March 15. It is led by Baba Jumpei, an
Associate Professor at University of Tokyo’s Department of Advanced Energy, and a specialist in
the application of power electronics and superconductivity for power systems.
•  Four more academics make up the core committee members. Six representatives of power utilities
and others from the electricity industry make up a list of 11 “observers”.
•  The committee has set a target of preparing the master plan for cable installation by spring 2022.

A core issue to consider will be how to install such a grid system on Japan’s deep and complex
seabed.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s current grid has several bottlenecks between regions because of low interconnection
capacity. Investment in the grid on-land could be expensive as it may require purchase of additional land. In
this sense, underwater construction may be cheaper. Still, any deep-sea construction projects are likely to
require major expenditure, which is currently guesstimated at a trillion yen. That would prevent the ability of

offshore wind power to reduce its costs in Japan in the next decade or so.



Euglena sees first jet flights powered by algae biofuel within a year
(New Energy Business News, March 18)
•  Biofuels producer Euglena says it has perfected a bio-jet diesel blend synthesized using algae that
satisfies the ASTM D7566 Annex 6 standard.

•  Euglena developed the fuel in collaboration with Chevron Lummus Global and Applied Research
Associates.
•  The fuel was manufactured at Euglena’s biofuel testing plant, the first of its type in Japan.
•  The biodiesel will be first used in aircraft later this year.

required to report annual numbers. The total of such emitters was also little changed at 12,341

businesses / business units in FY2017.



Shipper MOL buys stake in Norway’s Larvik Shipping to develop liquid CO2 carriers for CCS
(Nikkei, March 20)
•  MOL said on March 19 that it will enter the business of shipping liquified CO2. The Japanese

shipping company is buying a 25% stake in Norway’s Larvik Shipping and will start joint transport
operations in 2024.
•  MOL seeks to collect CO2 emissions from steel, cement and other manufacturers, store it and
recycle the gas, thus lowering overall emissions into the atmosphere. Carbon Capture, Storage and
Recycling is seen as a key technology for helping heavy emitters.
•  The investment amount is not disclosed but said to be in the range of several hundred-million yen.
MOL will dispatch some shipping staff to its partner.
•  The two companies plan to grow the business and eventually work with bigger ships to improve

the efficiencies of transporting liquid CO2.

Japanese manufacturers claim edge in solid-state and grid battery markets
(Nikkei, March 15)
•  Sumitomo Electric Industries’ Koganeya Masanobu says Japan leads the world in solid state battery
technology and grid battery storage.

•  Redox flow batteries, which make use of reactions whereby electricity is released when vanadium
and other ions are oxidized, are scalable by simply adding more electrolyte. The ability of these
batteries to store a charge for extended periods of time makes them popular with utilities in
Europe and the U.S., as well as in Japan. Redox batteries have a useful life of around 20 years.
•  NAS batteries are also well suited to grid energy storage applications because of their high
capacity and absence of self-discharge. These batteries can also be manufactured without using

rare metals.

TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki plant anti-terrorism measures woefully deficient
(NHK, March 16)
o  A Nuclear Regulation Authority audit of alarm systems fitted to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
nuclear power station to prevent intruders has revealed that multiple alarms have failed
since March 2020.
o  Despite being aware of the malfunctions and of the fact that the stopgap security
measures taken in lieu of the alarms were not effective, TEPCO security personnel did

not attempt to rectify the situation, says the Authority.
o  In an unprecedented move, the Authority has assigned the plant the lowest
counterterrorism defense rating on its four-point scale, in view of the fact that the plant
was left vulnerable to intruders for a significant period of time.
o  NRA chairman was quoted by media wondering if TEPCO has a lack of knowledge or is
not even trying when it comes to nuclear facility management.

Court gives green light to turning on Shikoku Electric’s Ikata Unit 3
(NHK, March 18)
o  The Hiroshima High Court has overturned a provisional disposition imposed last year in
relation to the Unit 3 reactor at the Ikata nuclear power station in Shikoku, saying that the
probability of a natural disaster serious enough to jeopardize the reactor’s safety was

“not high”.
o  Last year’s disposition was issued in response to a petition filed by residents of nearby
Hiroshima and ordered the reactor to remain off, citing earthquake and volcanic eruption
as specific risks.
o  Counsel for the plaintiffs in last year’s action said that because, scientifically speaking, the
risks in question are impossible to fully demonstrate, by placing the burden of proof on

local residents, the court has effectively blocked the residents’ path to stopping the
reactor.
o  Shikoku Electric welcomed the decision as “fair”.

OPINION: Fukushima 10 years on: Does nuclear still have a future in Japan?
(World Economic Review, March 15)
o  CONTEXT: This is a column by Prof. Kikkawa Takeo at the Graduate School of

Commerce and Management, Hitotsubashi University.
o  At the time of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, there were 54 nuclear power plants in
Japan and another three under construction. Today, 21 of these 57 have been slated for
decommissioning, and a mere nine reactors have been given the go-ahead restart under
the government’s new, stricter rules.
o  The government’s current basic energy outlook calls for up to 60% of electricity from
renewables, 10% from hydrogen and ammonia, and the remaining 30 to 40% from

nuclear sources by 2050, although the government has described this “plan” as a mere
point of reference for encouraging discussion.
o  While Prime Minister Suga’s carbon neutral declaration has created optimism amongst
the nuclear power lobby, this optimism will likely prove unwarranted. Indeed, METI
Minister Kajiyama himself has not changed his opposition to building new reactors as a
replacement for aging assets. And without investment in new reactors, the government’s

much vaunted small modular reactor (SMR) program is a mere pipe dream.
o  By placing the blame for the disaster squarely on TEPCO, the government has attempted
to frame itself as the “good guy” bringing the “villain” (the nuclear industry) to justice.
This also explains the government’s reluctance to issue clear guidelines on nuclear policy.
o  It’s hard to see a future for nuclear power in Japan.

This is the second ship-to-ship transfer for Kaguya.
•  Kaguya is based at JERA’s Kawagoe thermal power plant and plans to supply LNG-powered

vessels moored in the Chubu region.
•  LNG bunkering in Japan is carried out by a joint venture between JERA, NYK Line, Kawasaki Kisen,
and Toyota Tsusho. The JV procures LNG from JERA and operate the Kaguya.

If Goldman Sachs is selling,

Is it time to exit Japan’s solar market?

This year’s marquee deal in the Asia-Pacific renewables space may well be the
potential exit of Goldman Sachs from Japan’s solar market. The bank, known for its
investment acumen, has started to sound out potential buyers for its majority
ownership in Japan Renewable Energy Corp (JRE), a developer of solar and other
green energy assets. The potential sale will have many investors wondering if the
Japanese renewables market has turned after a surge in solar capacity over the last 10
years. Certainly, the structure of this market has shifted.

Still, Goldman’s likely exit is not only about structural reforms, but also a reflection of
the ESG momentum. Many European pension funds and other institutional investors
have taken to supporting ESG themes and threatening a withdrawal of funding from
firms and investment vehicles that do not engage.

With Japan’s investable pool of renewable assets still shallow, sizeable investment
options inside the country are slim. The expected return (and perceived risk) of Japan
solar has significantly decreased since JRE was formed.

This JRE sale will be the deal that people will not want to lose, even if it makes them
bid irrationally in the end to secure the bragging rights. For Goldman, it will mean
collecting significant financial gains.


How it started
Goldman’s entry timing was favorable. At the start of the previous decade, the
renewables industry, and especially solar, was in a funk. One of the early front-runners
in solar adoption, Spain, had recently reneged on government-subsidized tariffs for
renewable energy. Germany had started decreasing their own tariffs to mirror a drop
in solar panel prices and construction costs.

Goldman was one of the earlier investors to build an institutional business in Japan
around a new renewables tariff system introduced soon after the 2011 Fukushima
disaster. It registered Japan Renewable Energy (JRE) in 2012, the same year that the
country introduced the then world’s highest Feed-In Tariff; a guaranteed price at
which an operator of a solar or wind generation facility can sell their electricity over a
period of 20 or so years.

In less than a decade, JRE has built a portfolio of almost 420 MW, with another 410
MW currently under construction. In 2017, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC
agreed to buy a 25% stake in JRE.

The Fukushima disaster switched sentiment. Germany and several others vowed to
quit nuclear energy. The immediate winner was renewables. Even as Japan turned to
fossil fuels to fill in the gap vacated by nuclear, the then ruling party hastily put

together the FIT scheme to scale the renewable energy industry in Japan.

All experienced European and other global players were only too happy to bring their
knowhow to Japan.


How it’s going
Japan’s renewables capacity has certainly grown and the electricity market’s
unbundling has further diversified the industry that hitherto had been dominated from
generation to retail by 10 vertically integrated utilities.

However, while the market has developed and Japan’s government predictably
followed the European model of lowering the FIT price over time, some of the trend
lines from Europe have not carried over.

(1) Balance of Systems costs (non-solar panel costs) have not decreased in Japan in
line with the rest of the world. One reason is the often-long chain between the prime
Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor and the company that
sends workers to the site; so, the project has a lot of mouths to feed. There is no legal
limit on the number of subcontractors, and banks tend to lend only if there is a blue-
chip general contractor on the paperwork.

(2) A bankable general contractor decreases the perceived risk of the construction
process of the solar power plant. The risk, and therefore the expected return, between
operational projects and those under construction with debt financing locked in is
slim, reflecting a high degree of confidence in project execution.

JRE has as much capacity under construction as it does in operation. Bidders will likely
need to price its entire asset base as if it is all online.


How it will be - the biggest unknown
The FIT business model is being phased out. From next April, most new renewables
projects will need to apply for a Feed-In Premium (FIP), a less generous mechanism
that tends to reward renewables operators that also invest in storage. The stated goal
of the government is to have the FIP also expire and for solar, wind and other
renewable sources to compete for consumers in the open market.

Current investors in renewable energy in Japan bid for a FIT price that is almost four
times lower than the original.

Still, Goldman was not alone among investors eager to snap up early FIT certificates
at world-beating prices. Plenty of domestic and overseas prospectors entered the
field and were rewarded with 93 GW of FIT-certified projects. Of that, only about 58
GW is online or close. The true operational capacity may be much less, with a
substantial number of solar power plants poorly managed.

The remaining FIT-certified capacity could be construed as market overhang for the
Goldman deal, but several factors preclude this. While FIT certificates were relatively
easy to obtain, initially, getting access to land rights, a grid connection and securing
relevant permits was not.

Moreover, METI has begun a campaign to cancel FIT certificates for those that are
deemed to be sitting on them but not acting towards project realization. This move
may be due to feedback from the big power utilities, which argue that there is already
sufficient capacity in overall generation assets (including new coal power plants).

As a consequence, FIT certificates for projects not deemed as progressing by April
2022 will be canceled or asked to re-apply – at the current, lower FIT price. In
addition, today’s solar FIT certificates are awarded with an “unlimited curtailment
risk”. This means that if even if a new entrant renewables generator produces power,
the grid – still controlled by units of the 10 legacy power utilities – can decide not to
accept it.

Banks have been scratching their heads around curtailment and only a handful of
unlimited curtailment projects have been awarded limited-recourse project finance.

Many players with deep pockets have tried to get around the roadblocks to debt
financing and expedited construction by building the projects themselves, obtaining
financing after project completion. This likely means having to bundle and cross-
collateralize several projects together, which makes it tough to later sell them
individually.


Conclusion - Lots of bidders, leaks abound
With the pool of existing FIT-approved projects set to shrink, and the valuation of new
projects uncertain, the liquidity of the world’s No. 3 solar market is being tested.
Goldman’s asset should prove attractive and gather a significant number of bidders.

The sell-side bankers will need to identify whether potential bidders are spurious or
legitimate before opening up details of all projects for the suitors. This will affect not
only project values after divestiture, but also the investment of Goldman’s partner,
GIC.

While Goldman’s sale seems logical if opportunistic, the bank will likely not want to
indicate that it is exiting Japanese renewables completely. The bank has other
structural options. The margins from a JRE sale today, however, are probably too
good for Goldman to resist.

If Goldman Sachs is selling, is it time to exit Japan’s solar market? The answer
primarily depends on your return expectation.

TEPCO Marks Fukushima’s 10-Year Anniversary With “Red Card”
Casting Doubt on its Nuclear Strategy

On the 10th anniversary of the Fukushima accident another nuclear catastrophe beset
TEPCO, casting further doubt on it re-emerging as an operator of atomic power
facilities.

In a mixed week for the nuclear industry in Japan, TEPCO was issued with a “red
rating” by the regulator, the most serious warning, for poor execution of installing
safety measures. This immediately aborts the utility’s plan to restart two of its reactors
in spring and rules out the possibility of TEPCO operating a nuclear power plant until
at least H2 2022.

The latest in a long list of TEPCO missteps, after a concerted recent campaign to buy
goodwill with locals near its nuclear plants, may mark the end of the line for TEPCO as
it stands today. With a growing renewables business and options to expand in power
transmission, the TEPCO name and current structure looks ripe for change.

Last week, Japan’s Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) issued TEPCO with the worst
of four possible ratings. The status was assigned to TEPCO’s only operable nuclear
facility, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP in Niigata prefecture, because of deficiencies
relating to physical security of nuclear materials.

TEPCO is the first company to receive a “red rating.” NRA noted that a probe into the
deficiencies at the NPP will now take at least a year. METI confirmed that the facility is
not currently fit to operate, causing TEPCO’s stock to fall 10% on Wednesday
knocking $500 million off shareholder value.

Delaying restarting Kashiwazaki to late 2022 means it will be 10 years since the NPP’s
Units 6 was operating, and more than 11 years for Unit 7. Three of the facility’s four
oldest reactors have been offline since 2007, never restarted after a separate
earthquake that same year damaged equipment.

Even with regular maintenance, restarting a nuclear plant after such a long layoff is
technically challenging.

Given the cost of ongoing maintenance, safety checks, and additional investment in
new safety measures, the business case for TEPCO restarting Kashiwazaki is also
fading.

Once a fully private company and the world’s third-largest utility, TEPCO is now under
the control of the government. Its main shareholder is the state Nuclear Damage
Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation Corporation (NDF).

The utility’s state-mandated task is to operate its power business and generate cash to
pay for the Fukushima accident compensation and the decommissioning costs for the
wrecked Dai-Ichi NPP, as well as the nearby Dai-Ni NPP site. However, Fukushima

16

decommission cost estimates have jumped to $74 billion, compensation payments to
$80 billion, and area decontamination and storage to $60 billion.

This puts the total Fukushima accident-related costs at over $200 billion, with the
decommissioning timetable expected to take another 30 to 40 years.

NDF has already injected almost $100 billion into the company through over 100
separate fund-raising rounds to help it meet the Fukushima liabilities while also
remaining as a solvent business. TEPCO took cumulative losses of $25 billion in the
three years following the 2011 accident.

Ten years after Fukushima, TEPCO is still Japan’s largest power utility with sales of
220 TWh ($57 billion) for FY2019 compared with a peak of 292 TWh before the
accident. TEPCO continues to service almost one quarter of Japan’s total electricity
consumption though it has lost more customers than any other power utility since
consumers were allowed to switch providers in 2016.

TEPCO now has a peak load of 55 GW for its catchment area of nine prefectures that
includes greater Tokyo, compared with a 62 GW peak load in 2007. It has 31,000 staff
and over $100 billion in assets.

TEPCO Service Area
















All three of TEPCO’s NPPs have been closed since 2011.

Until Covid-19 hit, TEPCO had hoped to rebuild its profit to $3 billion per annum by
2027. The pandemic reduced TEPCO’s electricity sales by 10% YoY. Profits in 1H
FY2020 were down 65%. Management had also hoped to increase TEPCO’s stock
market capitalization 15-fold to $75 billion by 2027.

Even before Covid, TEPCO has struggled to rebuild its business. One of its electricity
sales agents was reprimanded last year for dubious sales practices. The retail unit has
lost over 15% of its sales to competitors in the last five years, and now faces the
possibility of being split off from TEPCO and sold in the near future. ENEOS is seen as
a possible buyer.

Meanwhile, TEPCO’s plans to expand into the gas distribution business in new areas

17


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

have mostly failed. The firm’s retail gas business in Kansai may be stalling due to low
subscriber numbers.

In the last five years, the company has separated into five legal entities: TEPCO
Holdings, TEPCO Fuel and Power, TEPCO Power Grid, TEPCO Energy Partner, and
TEPCO Renewable Power.





















TEPCO’s thermal generation assets (41 GW) were transferred to a new entity, JERA, in
April 2019, including its four LNG terminals, for $8 billion. The thermal generation
assets of Chubu Electric (24 GW), TEPCO’s adjacent utility, were also consolidated
into JERA (Japan NRG profiled JERA in our Aug. 24, 2020 edition).

TEPCO had hoped to list JERA and raise cash, but Covid-19 stalled those plans.




















18


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

TEPCO’s only remaining generation assets of any significance are in hydropower: 10
GW at 164 locations. The net book value of fixed assets was $70 billion at the end of
FY2020, including the residual value of its nuclear fleet.

TEPCO now buys its electricity mainly from JERA, paying $17 billion for power during
FY2019, and purchases of electricity sourced from renewables is expected to be
almost $6 billion this fiscal year.

TEPCO was one of Japan’s first major utilities to announce plans to become carbon
neutral by 2050. As part of this plan, it aims to install 7 GW of renewable generation
by 2030.

Energy transition has offered other avenues for TEPCO to revitalize, with the utility
seizing on its size and network to tap into a diverse set of partnerships. Below is a
selection of new energy joint ventures TEPCO is pursuing:

•  With E-mobility Power and Nichicon – fast-chargers for EVs
•  With NTT – a DC smart-city energy supply system in Chiba
•  With Tohoku Electric – an overhead AI diagnosis transmission line system
•  With Mitsui Fudosan – 100% renewable electricity plan for offices
•  With Royal Dutch Shell and RWE – floating wind turbine technology
•  With NEDO and Takashogu Thermal Engineering – thermal storage systems
•  With Hitachi – a multi-cable transmission system for offshore wind farms

In addition, TEPCO has vowed to create a new business around nuclear reactor
decommissioning in Fukushima prefecture.

Outside Japan, TEPCO recently won a substation contract in Thailand and also has
investments in Vietnam.

At core, TEPCO still has the biggest slice of the world’s No. 3 electricity market.
What’s more, the country’s 2050 net-zero emissions pledge and the associated move
to greater electrification present the utility with a growing market and new business
opportunities.

The hope that nuclear energy can be a money-spinner for TEPCO diminished last
week. NRA’s ruling is only the latest in a series of red cards shown to TEPCO’s
nuclear business.

If TEPCO is to raise $200 billion or more in needed to pay for the Fukushima cleanup,
it needs to pass the Kashiwazaki NPP to a more proficient operator.

The Japanese government also urgently needs to address its strategy for managing the
country’s nuclear assets in a consistent manner and implementing reforms to the
national grid system and TEPCO’s roles in those initiatives.

Japan must also keep electricity costs at an internationally competitive level.

GLOBAL       VIEW



Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Coal
Methane leaks from planned coal mines could have a bigger climate
impact than carbon emissions from U.S. coal plants, the nonprofit Global
Energy Monitor said in a report.

Biofuels

U.S. President Joe Biden's green fuel push using edible oils is helping
drive up vegetable oil prices that are already near record highs, hitting key
cost-sensitive consumers in India and Africa and stoking global food
inflation fears.

Renewables / Hydrogen
1). Apple said that it allotted $2.8 billion raised from green bonds last

years to fund 17 projects with 1.2 GW of renewable energy capacity.
2). Germany and Canada said they will jointly develop projects in green
hydrogen that utilize Canadian hydroelectric power with an eye on the
fuel’s export to Germany.
3). Planned investment in clean energy must increase by 30% to a total of
$131 trillion by 2050 to avert catastrophic climate change, International

Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said in its annual report. The agency
especially advocated the need to scale up hydrogen production.

LNG
Asia became the main destination for U.S. LNG exports last year as
volumes to the region rose 67% YoY in 2020. Asia accounted for almost

half, or 3.1 Bcf/d, of all U.S. LNG exports, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration

Aviation
U.S. airlines United and Delta said they may stop bleeding cash as soon as
this month as air travel starts to recover. This month American airports had
some of their busiest days since March 2020.


Australia
Australia's Fortescue Metals Group, the world's No.4 iron ore miner,
outlined a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030, bringing forward the
target by 10 years. The company aims to start producing green hydrogen
as soon as 2023.

| Information Administration |

China
1) China published its next five-year energy plan, which sees to boost the
share of non-fossil sources in the country’s energy mix (including nuclear

and hydropower) to around 20% in by the end of the period, up from
about 15.8%.
2) Factory and retail sector activity in China was strong in the first two
months of this year, beating expectations. Industrial output was up 16.9%
YoY.

Egypt

Shell agrees on deal with units of Cheiron Petroleum and Cairn Energy to
sell onshore upstream assets in the country for $646 million.

India
Officials close to Prime Minister Modi are debating whether to set a 2050
net-zero-emissions target, similar to the pronouncements of most of the

world’s major economies in the last six months. Such a target would mean
an overhaul of the Indian economy, which currently relies on coal. The
deadline might even be set at 2047, which would mark the centenary of
India’s independence from British rule.

Russia

The price at which Gazprom supplies gas to China dropped below $120
per 1,000 m3 in January as it is tied to the oil price with a nine-month time
lag. That price was a fifth of Asian LNG price at the time.

Thailand
Thai authorities are drafting a master plan to help the country reach zero
net carbon emissions by 2050, and will present a draft during next month.

Changing the power industry’s fuel mix and a move into EVs are expected
to feature.

UAE
ADNOC banned engineering giant Petrofac from competing for new
contracts in UAE after one of its former executives pleaded guilty to

charges of making bribes to secure business. UAE accounts for 10% of
Petrofac’s revenue.

UK
BP said it aims to build Britain's largest hydrogen plant by 2030 as part of
the country's push to boost use of the fuel and cut emissions. The plant in
northern England will have capacity of up to 1 GW of blue hydrogen,

about a fifth of Britain’s target by the end of the decade.

U.S.
1) Jane Lubchenco, a marine ecologist with wide federal government
experience, has joined the Biden administration to lead climate and
environment efforts at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the

White House said on Friday.

2) Three environmental groups filed a false advertising complaint against
Chevron with the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, alleging that the
U.S. oil major has overstated its investment in renewable energy and
actions to curb greenhouse gas emissions.


3) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it will require power
plants in a dozen states to cut their smog emissions starting this year as
part of an effort to help areas of the country that are downwind of
polluting industry.
