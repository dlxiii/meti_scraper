NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Japan mulls adding tax breaks to incentivize battery production
(Nikkei, Sept 23)
•  The govt will soon announce its October economic stimulus package. Among other items, it is
considering adding tax incentives to cut production costs for firms involved in production of
semiconductors, batteries and biotech. The measures would seek to support manufacturers over a
5-10-year period and prioritize sectors with a high market entry risk.
•  PM Kishida will announce the pillars of his economic stimulus package on Sept 25. Some of it is

said to draw inspiration from the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) legislation.
Other key elements of the package include corporate tax cuts for the production and sales of
critical goods from the perspectives of decarbonization, digitization, and economic security.



Power industry body rules on anti-competitive behavior, backs up regulator’s allegations

(FEPC statement, Sept 13)
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPC) acknowledged Japan Fair Trade Commission’s
allegations of anti-competitive conduct.
•  FEPC confirmed that its members, the former regional power monopolies (EPCOs), shared
information when they planned entry into markets outside traditional areas. However, it denied the
JFTC’s claim that business decisions and information related to power retail were shared among
company employees.
•  FEPC announced stronger antitrust compliance measures, including more staff training and new

federation meeting rules.
•  CONTEXT: In March, the JFTC asked FEPC to probe if trade association functions were abused to
organize anti-competitive conduct. Kansai Electric (KEPCO), Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric, and
Kyushu Electric had allegedly formed a cartel.
• TAKEAWAY: After exposing the cartel in March, the JFTC continues to monitor the power sector. Fact-finding

surveys on how former regional monopolies and independent operators compete continue. The results are
expected to impact the on-going debate about fully separating the retail, power transmission and power
generation units of the EPCO’s, which should be arguably one of the biggest developments in the Japanese
power sector in at least a decade.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

FEPC to abolish presidents’ meeting over cartel allegations
(Asahi Shimbun, Sept 14)
o  FEPC, which is composed of Japan's ten major electric power companies, will abolish the
"Presidents Meeting," where the heads of the utilities gather once a month.
o  The decision will take effect in FY2024, and was made in response to concerns raised by

lawyers following allegations of cartel-like behavior in the power market.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  In March, the JFTC slapped the EPCOs with fines totaling ¥101 billion for violating the
Anti-monopoly Act.
o  The lawyers' investigation concluded that no illegal information exchange took place
during the meetings. However, they raised concerns about the Presidents Meeting.
o  CONTEXT: FEPC was established in 1952 and about 200 representatives from among its

10 member companies participate in the organization’s activities. The highest authority
within the federation is believed to be the Presidents Meeting.


METI to push for cleaner hydrogen with new regulation
(Japan NRG, Sept 20)
•  METI is writing a new regulation to drive a shift to hydrogen with a lower carbon footprint, a

ministry official told the INCHEM Tokyo 2023 conference.
•  Murao Kozue, the Hydrogen and Ammonia Division assistant director, said building a hydrogen-
centered economy defeats its purpose if the molecules are not “clean”. The ministry plans to write
numerical targets for industries on the usage of low-carbon or net zero hydrogen, encouraging a
gradual shift, she said.
•  CONTEXT: The 2017 Basic Hydrogen Strategy was updated for the first time in June this year with

a clear shift in tone to put more emphasis on clean hydrogen. The updated version added support
for the fuel standards proposed by the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells.
Japan’s hydrogen supplies are derived from fossil fuels, releasing 10 tons of carbon for 1 ton of
hydrogen production.
• TAKEAWAY: Strong enforcement of the new regulation is not possible because Japan has almost no supply of
green hydrogen. This will likely be more like a guideline. There are only two domestic producers supplying
green hydrogen on a commercial basis: Obayashi Corp and Yamanashi Prefecture. Their combined production

is several tons per year.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mitsubishi begins full-scale operation of Takasago Hydrogen Park

(Company statement, Sept 15)
o  Mitsubishi Power (MP) announced the full operation of the Takasago Hydrogen Park, the
world's first integrated hydrogen validation facility.
o  The site is dedicated to hydrogen production, storage, and utilization. It employs
technologies such as an alkaline electrolyzer and large hydrogen-fueled gas turbines.
o  MP aims to validate hydrogen co-firing and 100% hydrogen firing in gas turbines, and
verify the technologies for next-gen hydrogen production. The hydrogen created on-site

will be used for validation in a grid-connected gas turbine combined cycle power plant,
with the goal of implementing 30% hydrogen co-firing by late 2023, and 100% hydrogen
firing in 2024.
o  Mitsubishi Power is also testing on-site “turquoise” hydrogen manufacturing.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JFE Engineering to provide Nisshin OilliO with hydrogen co-firing
(Company statement, Sept 21)

o  JFE Engineering will install a co-firing gas turbine for a cogeneration system of 8 MW
capacity at Nisshin OilliO’s Yokohama Isogo factory. The system starts commercial
operation in April 2025. Nisshin aims for 30% hydrogen co-firing by 2027.

RITE: Japan needs to capture 200 mln tons of CO2 by 2050
(Japan NRG, Sept 22)
•  Japan will need to capture 200 million tons of CO2 to reach its 2050 neutrality goal, a researcher
at the influential think tank, the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE),

told the INCHEM Tokyo 2023 conference.
•  RITE chief researcher Yogo Katsunori said Japan needs to rely on negative emission technologies if
renewables costs remain high as today.
•  To capture 200 million tons of CO2, Japan would need to install 10 units of 100 ton/ day direct air
capture systems every year from 2030 to 2050. RITE plans to develop DAC equipment that can
capture 0.5 ton/ day by 2025.
•  CONTEXT: Since September 2021, Swiss-based Climeworks has operated the world’s first large-

scale negative emissions facility. Eight collector containers at the company’s Orca facility in Iceland
remove 4,000 tons of CO2 a year, according to its website. It plans to scale that up. The global
economy emits about 33 billion tons of CO2 annually.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JAPEX, Indonesian SKK Mingas to work on CCUS
(Company statement, Sept 21)

o  Japan Petroleum Exploration (JAPEX) and Indonesian SKK Mingas, also known as the
special task force for upstream oil and gas, signed a MoU on CCU and CCUS
collaboration.
o  The two will build CCU and CCUS hubs and clusters in Indonesia using enhanced oil
recovery methods.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Chubu Electric joins BP to develop CCUS at Nagoya Port, storage in Indonesia

(Denki Shimbun, Sept 12)
o  Chubu Electric will study CO2 storage in Indonesia together with BP. Since February,
both have been studying CCUS potential at Nagoya Port in Japan.
o  A BP subsidiary will use the Tangguh gas field in Indonesia as a storage site and is
evaluating technical requirements and costs.
o  The potential storage capacity is about 1.8 billion tons.



Pioneering carbon capture unit Petra Nova is operational again, says JX Nippon
(Powermag, Sept 13)
•  JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration and Petra Nova resumed operation of what is often called the
world’s largest CCS facility.
•  The facility restarted on Sept 5 after being shut since May 2020. It’s one of only two CCS retrofits

at a commercial power plant globally. The project, located in Texas, is designed to remove over
90% of CO2 emissions from a coal-fired unit at the W.A. Parish station.
•  The $1 billion project, which started in 2016, uses the Kansai Mitsubishi Carbon Dioxide Recovery
Process to capture CO2, which is then transported to an oilfield for enhanced oil recovery.
•  The U.S. Dept of Energy supported the project and reported that Petra Nova captured 92.4% of
CO2 emissions from flue gas during the demo. Cost problems led to the project's shutdown in

2020, but JX Nippon believes it has made breakthroughs and now plans to operate it year-round.
•  The facility aims to capture about 1.4 million metric tons of GHGs annually.

Green steel R&D subsidy to more than double
(Government statement, Sept 15)
•  METI plans to more than double the Green Innovation Fund financing of green steel development
to ¥449 billion, up from an initial ¥193 billion.
•  Nippon Steel, JFE Steel, Kobe Steel and Japan Research Development Center for Metals will

receive the funds.
•  CONTEXT: There are four research projects in Japan on the use of hydrogen instead of coke to
remove oxygen from iron ore. Steelmakers are expected to produce hydrogen in-house from LNG.
The R&D projects started in FY2021 and are due to run to FY2030.
• TAKEAWAY: Steelmakers will need GW-capacity electrolyzers to meet their massive hydrogen requirement.
Decarbonizing steel production is essential in cutting global GHGs; iron and steel production are two of the

most carbon-heavy industries. Sweden’s H2 Green Steel appears to be the global leader in switching to
hydrogen-aided steel production and says it will start producing green steel commercially in late 2025. There
are efforts to introduce green steelmaking in other countries too, including Brazil, which make Japan’s
progress in this niche appear slow.



Enecoat to commercialize mini-PSC modules in 2024
(Japan NRG, Sept 14)
•  Kyoto University startup, Enecoat Technologies, plans to launch the sale of small perovskite solar
cell (PSC) modules for digital gadgets in 2024, said CEO Kato Naoya, at Smart Energy Week.
•  In August, the company hit a 21.2% energy efficiency rate for a 7.5 cm3 module.

•  In 2026, the company plans to start mass producing larger outdoor modules for power generation.
It also aims to go public before 2026.
•  CONTEXT: Panasonic and Sekisui Chemical plan to commercialize PSC products in the next few
years. Enecoat’s main focus is large perovskite system installations in outdoor spaces, but it might
be making this move into a different segment in order to be first-in-market, and to monetize its
technology.

• TAKEAWAY: Finding the right insulator that won’t impact power efficiency is crucial in the success of PSC-
mounted IoT devices. Solar modules heat up and may cause electric shocks when in direct contact, and require
protection when used for indoor IoT devices.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Panasonic to commercialize PSC manufacturing equipment
(Japan NRG, Sept 14)
o  Panasonic Product Engineering plans to commercialize PSC manufacturing equipment, a
company official told Japan NRG. The Panasonic group has applied an ink-jet printing
mechanism to produce thin layers of perovskite crystals.
o  Presently, academic institutions are testing the prototype equipment. The company did

not elaborate on the commercialization schedule.
o  CONTEXT: Six years ago, Peccell Technologies, which was founded by the ‘father’ of
perovskite, Professor Miyasaka Tsutomu, began to market PSC manufacturing
equipment. Subsequently, producers of equipment for thin-film PV modules followed.

•  Toyota Motor plans to more than triple its Toyota and Lexus brand EV production to 600,000 units
in 2025, according to notifications the automaker sent to major parts suppliers. The target output
for 2024 is 190,000 units.
•  Toyota sold just 24,000 EVs in 2022.
•  If the targets are achieved in 2025, EVs will account for 5-6% of total sales.




Sumitomo completes EV battery station in Hokkaido
(Company statement, Sept 13)
•  Sumitomo completed the construction of the "EV Battery Station CHITOSE" in Hokkaido, with a 6
MW output and a 23 MWh capacity. This facility, set to begin full operation in the second half of
FY2023, will join the Supply and Demand Adjustment Market (also known as Balancing Market) and

the Capacity Market starting FY2024.
•  This battery station is the first private sector system that will have a direct connection to the grid's
high-voltage network
•  A Sumitomo-Nissan Motor joint venture, 4R Energy, supplied the batteries.
•  CONTEXT: Sumitomo began grid storage battery demos in 2015 and works with the govt to
institutionalize grid storage battery businesses. Hokkaido is known for its renewable energy
potential and power grid stabilization R&D. Since its grid is mostly separate from mainland Japan,

it’s a suitable location for Sumitomo’s plans to develop 100 MW of energy storage by FY2027.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

(Nikkei Asia, Sept 19)
•  Hitachi Zosen will collaborate with Germany's MAN Energy Solutions to develop technology that
can convert ship engines to run on green methanol.
•  This conversion process, expected to take one to two months, allows existing engines running on

heavy fuel oil to use methanol. Test operations are set to begin in 2024.
•  Converting engines is cost-effective, about one-third the cost of replacement, since ships typically
have a 20-year lifespan.


MOL to launch first sightseeing ship using biofuel and hydrogen

(Nikkei, Sept 13)
•  In April 2024, MOL launched Japan's first hybrid sightseeing ship powered by biofuel and

KEPCO restarts Takahama Unit 2; all its NPPs now operational
(Japan NRG, Company statement, Nikkei, Sept 24)
•  Kansai Electric, also known as KEPCO, restarted the 47-year-old Unit 2 at the Takahama NPP (Fukui
Prefecture). Now, all of the company’s seven nuclear reactors can be operated. However, two units
recently went offline for regular maintenance.
•  KEPCO is the most reliant of Japan’s big utilities on nuclear generation. Without it, the company’s

spending on fossil fuels rises significantly. The utility expects nuclear stations to account for more
than 30% of its power volumes this year.
•  CONTEXT: Unit 4 of Ooi NPP was idled for maintenance checks on Aug 31 and Unit 3 of
Takahama NPP did the same on Sept 18. Both should be able to restart by January 2024, the
winter power demand peak season, unless there are technical or other issues.
• TAKEAWAY: The reduction in thermal fuel costs will positively impact KEPCO's earnings, leading to an

additional annual profit of about ¥145 billion. From a consumer viewpoint, this is also good news – if you live
and work in western Japan. All the 12 reactors (11.7 GW) that have been allowed to restart in the country are
situated in the west of the country. One 1 GW of nuclear capacity displaces roughly 1 million tons of LNG
imports a year. Thus it is no surprise that Japan’s LNG imports were down 17% in July on a YoY basis and
again almost 10% in August. The situation is completely different in eastern Japan, however, including the
Tokyo area, which now regularly faces capacity shortages during peak demand seasons.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Chugoku Electric to restart Shimane Unit 2 in Aug 2024
(Company statement, Sept 11)
o  Chugoku Electric will restart Shimane NPP Unit 2 in August 2024. This is the first time the

company has provided a specific restart plan.
o  The plan is to load fuel in June and bring the reactor online in August, followed by the
resumption of commercial power operations in September.
o  This will be the first restart for the facility in more than 12 years. It was shut for regular
inspection in January 2012.
o  CONTEXT: The station is located in western Japan.




A city in Nagasaki area mulls the idea of hosting nuclear fuel disposal site
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 13)
•  The Tsushima City Council (Nagasaki Pref) adopted a petition requesting acceptance of a so-called
literature research as the first step towards being selected as the location for a final disposal site
for high-level radioactive waste.
•  Mayor Takanobu Hita plans to make a final decision by Sept 27. If the literature research request is

accepted, Tsushima City would become the third municipality to undertake the review, following
Suttsu and Kamoenai in northern Hokkaido.

Hokkaido Electric and IHI begins research of CCS at Tomakomai coal plant
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 22)
•  Together with Hokkaido Electric, IHI began to assess the scale and specifications for CCS facilities
at the coal-fired Tomakomai Atsuma Power Plant (1.65 GW).
•  In June, JOGMEC selected seven projects to spearhead carbon neutrality efforts by 2050; the goal

is to develop model sites that could demonstrate how CCS can be scaled and its costs reduced.
•  CONTEXT: IHI has been re-entrusted with some of the tasks for this project. Both companies
conducted a desk study of CCS for Unit 4 of the same power plant in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 as
part of the NEDO project.
•  Hokkaido Electric, Japan Petroleum Exploration (JAPEX), and Idemitsu Kosan are also exploring
the Tomakomai area for potential CCS sites.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
KEPCO to test solid-based CCS
(Japan NRG, Sept 22)
o  Kansai Electric (KEPCO) will begin test runs of a pilot carbon capture system, using solid-
phase materials to absorb the gas. The pilot will run at its Maizuru coal power plant in
December, according to the Research Institute of Technology for the Earth (RITE).

o  The system has a 40 tons/ day CO2 capture capacity and will be placed in 60 °C
conditions. Zeolite and other materials will be used to capture carbon.
o  CONTEXT: KEPCO together with RITE and Kawasaki Heavy Industries aims to develop a
large-scale carbon capture system that uses solids. This would be an alternative to
commonly used amine solution, which is kept at high temperatures and is flammable.
Further, an onsite carbon liquefaction facility, to allow the CO2 to be transported over
long distances, is under construction and is expected to be completed in 2024.

New U.S. sanctions target Arctic LNG 2 project, Japanese stakeholders impacted
(Japan NRG, Sept 20)
•  The U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russia, targeting Arctic LNG 2 that includes Japanese
stakeholders. Japan has said it will remain in the project for economic security reasons.
•  The project, located in Russia's Arctic Circle, is led by Moscow-based Novatek, with Mitsui and
JOGMEC holding a combined 10% stake.
•  Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary emphasized the country's main goal to ensure a stable energy

supply; but the sanctions could complicate support for the Arctic LNG 2 project and delay its
production.
•  U.S. sanctions target Russian companies in the project, as well as a UAE firm providing services.
•  CONTEXT: Novatek aims to begin production at Arctic LNG 2 by end of the year, with a goal to
reach full capacity by early 2024. The project is designed to have three production lines with a
combined annual capacity of 19.8 million metric tons of LNG.

• TAKEAWAY: Japan's official stance has been to balance energy security with reducing dependence on Russian
energy sources where feasible. Despite condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Japan continues to hold
stakes in significant fossil fuel projects in Russia. This position has at times been challenged by G7 allies and
may again come under scrutiny with the start of production at Arctic LNG 2.




Japan and Canada sign MoC on battery supply chains
(Government statement, Sept 21)
•  METI, the Canadian Department of Industry, and other relevant ministries signed a MoC to build
sustainable and reliable battery supply chains in the two countries.
•  The agreement aims to fuel investments, cooperation in emergencies, promote the use of

renewable energy in supply chains, standardize recycling, etc.
•  A government-business sector round table was held on this subject. Participants included
Panasonic Energy, PPES, Asahi Kasei, Toyota Tsusho, Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsui & Co, Sumitomo
Corp, Canadian companies and representatives of the two governments.
• TAKEAWAY: This agreement is another step toward greater integration among G7 allies, who seek to lessen
their dependence on China for metals and materials seen as crucial to clean energy technologies. According to

the U.S. Geological Survey, lithium reserves in Canada are some of the largest in the world. However, in terms
of output, Canada only has about 2% of China's production; so Canada’s mining sector will need large
investments over the next decade.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Local Taxes on Renewables Is Now a Trend –
Aomori Prefecture the Latest to Step Up

Municipal governments hitting renewable energy projects with taxes seems to be
becoming a trend in Japan. Next, the main question is whether this phenomenon will
accelerate or just limp along meekly. Will more cities and regions decide to wield
taxation as a weapon to control the development of renewables projects that can
sometimes cause environmental problems and anger local residents?

What happens in the next six to twelve months could prove to be a pivotal watershed
in Japan’s plans to build renewable energy infrastructure in order to reach its clean
energy goals by 2030, and eventually 2050.

Following recent action by Mimasaka City and Miyagi Prefecture, two weeks ago the
Aomori Prefecture said it will soon unveil its own tax plan for renewable energy
projects. Amori’s decision came at a moment when the renewable energy sector was
deliberating on the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications’ response to the
Miyagi plan.

The first two municipalities took aim at narrow tax targets: Mimasaka on solar farm
operators, and Miyagi on projects that caused deforestation. Aomori says it will target
all renewable operators across the board. Recently, the Aomori governor gave a news
conference to better explain his plan.


Tax for cohabitation
On September 12, Aomori governor Miyashita Soichiro announced his government's
preliminary plans to introduce a new tax on renewable operators. Next, the
prefectural government will begin studies on the scope and details of the new system
in the current fiscal year and will decide by March 2024 whether to push ahead with
the plan. The tax complements his other plan to set zones where renewable
installations will be prohibited.

Miyashita made this major policy announcement only three months after his first
election as governor in June. Previously he had served as a mayor of Mutsu City for
nearly nine years. He was Japan's youngest mayor, elected at age 35.

The governor’s message was strong. He wants to protect the region’s interests,
claiming that large renewables operators are exploiting Aomori’s nature, transmitting
power to users outside of the prefecture and not paying a cent. “Renewables need to
harmonize with nature, communities and make economic contributions,” he said.

He envisages taxes on existing installations, as well as new projects, and all types of
renewables from solar, biomass, to onshore and offshore wind. The prefecture has no
offshore wind installations but this year the national government selected Aomori’s
Sea of Japan coastal area as a potential site for a 600 MW national project.

As the tax base is broad, the proceeds will be used not only to protect the
environment but also to finance public welfare projects, education and various other
purposes. The new plan, Miyashita hopes, will systematically change renewable
operators’ behavior and will drive them to adapt more to local needs.

He emphasized that he is supportive of renewables and climate initiatives, but wants
to see green energy primarily for local consumption. “Aomori can be 91% self-
sufficient with green energy if the new offshore wind projects, and installed but non-
operating capacities, come online,” Miyashita said.

The tax plan will start with onshore wind and will gradually spread to other types of
installations. Aomori currently has 794 MW of onshore wind power stations, the most
of the country’s 47 prefectures.

Type               Capacity           Prefectural ranking
Onshore wind          794 MW                 No. 1

Solar              895 MW                  30th
Biomass             102 MW                  19th
Hydro                4 MW                   30th

Total              1,795 MW                NA


Aomori won’t copy Miyagi
When the Miyagi prefectural assembly passed the renewable tax ordinance in July,
fears that this move spreads to other prefectures began to trouble renewable
operators. They expected Miyagi’s neighbors, such as Yamagata and Fukushima
prefectures, to follow as they have coordinated in cross-boundary wind project
reviews.

Nara, Yamanashi and Hyogo prefectures, which have ordinances to fine offenders of
solar installation rules, were also eyed as possibilities, as well as Shizuoka which
suffered landslides Blaine’s on solar projects, but Aomori was off their radar. The
second surprise is Miyashita’s ambitious plan is to tax all renewables, not just locally
unpopular solar or wind projects.

In Japan, municipalities require the approval of the Minister of Internal Affairs and
Communications to levy local taxes. The ministerial review of the Miyagi tax began on
July 19. Previously, the minister proposed Mimasaka City to hold more dialog with
those facing taxation, which implies disapproval.

The future of Miyashita’s plan is marked by uncertainties. His rather explosive remarks
at the news conference may trigger conflicts with various stakeholders, such as the
national government and leading energy companies. Wind is a well-established sector
in the area with over 100 players. Some municipalities in Aomori are investing in
renewables, including large wind projects.

Rokkasho Village is a minority shareholder of the 51 MW Futamata Furyoku wind
operator, and Yokohama Township has a stake in the 32.2 MW Yokohama Machi
Hibari Taira wind station.

Some operators are running in the red. Tsugaru Furyoku Hatsuden, which operates
the 34.5 MW Jusanko wind farm, recently posted a net loss of ¥259 million. Miyashita
argues that since the tax will be evenly spread out, its large base should have
negligible impact on each business.

While small community-based renewables are likely to escape the tax, there’s still the
question: How do you separate power that’s consumed in Aomori with volumes
transmitted outside the prefecture when it comes to accounting? Also, how do you
position waste-generated biogas? Is it considered harmful to the environment and
community interests? Will the tax slow the development of new types of renewables in
Aomori, such as ocean wave energy?

The Aomori Wind Energy Promotion Council that comprises wind operators,
component suppliers, contractors and investors told Japan NRG that it has no plan to
hold direct dialogue with the governor or the prefectural government.

In the end, the draft tax plan may not resemble what Miyashita had in mind. His
impact may be limited to new projects, including possibly the country’s largest 320
MW Michinoku project. But his bold move has fueled anti-renewables sentiment in
other parts of the country. An increasing number of municipality chiefs are openly
expressing discontent with local solar and wind installations and plans. Following
Sojitz scrapping the 109 MW Hokkaido wind project in June, Wakayama and Iwate
governors declared that they were against large wind projects.

Some municipalities are talking of tighter regulations. The new projects are getting
bigger amid the national push for more renewables. Of 11 onshore wind project plans
filed with METI and MoE in the past year, six were over 100 MW. And so, perhaps
soon a second, and even a third unruly prefecture will emerge with designs of new
taxes leading to the potential for the situation to snowball. That’s an administrative
environment that renewable energy developers and operators would find highly
unfavorable.

Cow Manure as a New Rocket Fuel?
Japanese Space Startup Gets Ready to Lift Off


Generations of kids around the world have grown up with tales that drinking milk will
make them big and strong. Soon, milk retailers might be able to tap into another
childhood dream, by linking the popular dairy product with space travel.

The amazing story of how Japan’s dairy cows might contribute to the space race
started with a local problem. The northern island of Hokkaido had an issue with power
supply, which constrained local farmers from ramping up operations. So, the farmers
decided to find a novel solution.

One thing that’s plentiful on any dairy farm is manure. It might not be pretty, but the
chemical properties of cow manure carry energy potential. The excrement can be
partially converted into biogas, which naturally contains methane.

This biogas has been used for micro power plants in farming communities, offering
enough to fuel 50-300 kW-sized generators. But studies over the last year have shown
that the manure could offer a better end-product: liquid biomethane (LBM). This fuel
could be powerful enough to fire rockets.

Were the tale to end here, it might serve as an amusing anecdote. Except that one
Japanese firm has committed to flying a rocket with LBM into space. It would be a
world first, using fuel made from cow manure. Meanwhile, there are projects
underway also to use LBM to replace fossil fuels in factories and for ships.

So, how did farmers, gas manufacturers and rocket scientists get on board in the same
room? Japan NRG has the full story.

Hokkaido: a land of milk and manure
Hokkaido produces a quarter of the country’s milk. It also produces 20 million tons of
livestock manure, which is around a quarter of the national total. Dairy cows are raised
to grow larger than in past years and today produce much more milk. This means they
eat more and release more manure. In Hokkaido, almost all manure is used as
fertilizer.

The odor released from wet manure has actually led to community conflicts. So, as a
solution, the Sanei Farm in the Taiki Township built the country’s first biogas power
generation plant in 2013; it treats the manure from about 1,600 dairy cows and
removes the odor before dumping it onto farmland. Biogas and electricity were
“secondary byproducts”.

The Sanei Farm has done well. It grew its milk business, almost doubling in size over
the past decade. Other local farms then built power plants to run on biogas. But
facing transmission capacity shortages, they approached an Osaka-based gas
manufacturer, Air Water, to ask if there was a way to apply biogas outside of electricity
generation.

Among Air Water’s clients is a space startup called Interstellar Technologies (IST),
which also happens to be based in Hokkaido. IST had built a rocket launch base in
Taiki and was buying oxygen and other gases from Air Water to fuel its vehicle. And
so, the rocket developer, the gas maker and dairy farms came together to develop an
LBM supply chain as a natural consequence of their needs.

Cow manure, when heated and fermented at 40 C, starts to release biogas consisting
of around 59% methane and 39% CO2, as well as traces of sulfur, water and nitrogen.
The gas is cooled into a liquid state, and in the process non-methane gases are
removed.

Last year, Air Water tested if it were possible to create a gas that could be used as
fuel from biogas. The results were surprising. The company managed to achieve a
methane purity of over 99% using a proprietary carbon capture technique that
deploys heat exchange membranes and refrigeration methods via liquid nitrogen
used for food processing. Air Water has a division that supplies chilled food products
to supermarkets.

That level of methane content meant that LBM could be used as a substitute for LNG.
In fact, LBM was more efficient than LNG, which carries only about 70-80% methane.

IST needed a fuel with particularly high energy density. Rocket fuels combust at 3,000
C and most elements burn off, but the less impurities they contain the better for the
safety of other rocket components. Methane with 99% purity is good enough.

“We were planning to use LNG and were going to build an LNG distillation plant
because LNG’s methane content is 70-80%; but LBM is much better,” said Horie
Takahiro, IST’s founder, in his YouTube channel.

And so, IST developed a six-ton rocket called ZERO, which will be fueled with LBM.
The first test launch is in October.

Methane in space
Methane as a space fuel is being considered by a few countries. In 2022, China’s
LandSpace launched the world’s first liquid-methane propelled rocket, and SpaceX
also plans methane-propelled space travel.

But the world has yet to see a rocket fueled by cow manure. A rocket specialist
confirmed to Japan NRG that 99% methane LBM is good enough to launch rockets.

“It is not a question of purity; 99.9% is not necessarily better than 99%. It depends on
the entire combustion mechanism affected by the type of oxygen used to ignite the
methane,” he said, adding that rocket launchers are focused on methane-propelled
systems because they eye landing on Mars and using methane collected on that
planet’s surface to fuel the return journey.

In contrast, on Sept 7, Japan’s space agency, JAXA, launched its HIIA rocket to the
Moon with liquid hydrogen.


Is it sustainable?
According to IST’s Horie, the beauty of the LBM ecosystem is its sustainability. After
all, the biogas is generated from cow manure and is thus a non-fossil fuel. Biogas is
classified as carbon neutral, and while it emits greenhouse gases in its production,
they’re not accounted for in the carbon inventory system.

What’s more, thanks to this ecosystem, the dairy farms hardly need to use outside
power sources. They also use the methane they produce as a heat source to treat the
manure.
IST’s Horie sees further emissions reduction potential through the construction of a
liquefaction plant on IST premises to save on the need to transport the fuel.

Of course, for all these improvements to be considered a “carbon neutral”
development, the emissions from space launches themselves have to be included in
the calculations. Once a rocket takes off, it releases carbon, methane and other gases
into the atmosphere. At launch, IST’s rocket burns 37 kg of fuel every second, with
fuel quantities diminishing as it goes higher and starts to separate.

To test the sustainability premise of this undertaking, Japan NRG calculated the
carbon emissions of the LBM supply chain based on public data and estimated them
at a minimum of 130 tons of CO2/ year. (See table below for details).

Air Water declined to elaborate on our emissions calculations, but it did say that using
LBM instead of LNG allows for a 60% reduction in emissions in various industrial
supply chains.

Besides IST, a number of Japanese companies are planning to introduce LBM to
replace LNG. These include Panasonic, Yotsuba Milk Products, and Obihiro Gas.
Mitsui OSK Lines and its customer JERA also tested LBM for sailing ships.

Air Water plans to invest ¥60 billion to expand its 360 ton/ year LBM supply chain to
10,000 tons/ year. The investment includes spending on biogas and liquefaction
plants.

Manure happens
As attractive as the manure-enabled system sounds, it might be tough to replicate
outside of Hokkaido. In other regions, there are more meat cattle raised than dairy
cows. The former produce manure with a lower liquid ratio, which would then require
additional water to process. Drier dung tends to congest pipes.

Most Japanese farms are small, keeping less than 100 heads of cattle, which would
hardly make it worthwhile to install the necessary processing equipment. Even worse,
many of Japan’s graying farmers worry if anyone will want to take over their business
when they hang up their boots amid a shrinking population. A regular sized biogas
plant costs ¥200 million and takes 20 years to depreciate.

Recent spikes in global energy and grain prices are just the latest concerns for
Japanese dairy farmers, with some closing their business altogether.

Now, perhaps more than ever, the message of supporting local agriculture needs to
be amplified if sustainable farming systems like the LBM supply chain are to take root.

For the youngest generation in Japan, supporting climate action could start by
drinking a glass of milk a day.

NOTE: The gas liquefaction plant is located in Obihiro City, 50-60 km from the Taiki farm. 30-ton trucks
are used for transport, releasing 200 kg of carbon daily. Also, more fossil fuels could be consumed if
additional heating is required on the back of an unexpected drop in temperature.


Cost comparison: LBM production vs. LNG imports (Japan NRG estimate)

LBM production cost per ton             ¥6 million

LNG import cost per ton              ¥0.4 - ¥1.6 million

NOTE: Production cost is estimated on the basis of Air Water’s ¥60 billion investment plan for a 10,000
ton/ year facility. The import cost reflects the range of LNG import value in the past three years.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ LNG
Chevron’s Wheatstone LNG export facility returned to full production after a fault at
the plant cut output by around 25% last week. The problem coincided with escalation
of labor strikes at other Chevron facilities that collectively account for about 6% of
global LNG supply. That strike was resolved on Sept 21.

Canada/ Oil exports
The long-delayed Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion (TMX), which will nearly triple
the flow of crude from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, will launch early next year. This will
shake up North America's supply by diverting barrels now mainly delivered to refiners
and exporters in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast.

Congo/ Hydropower
The Democratic Republic of Congo is still looking for partners in potentially the
world’s biggest hydropower project. Talks with Australia’s Fortescue Future Industries
have stalled regarding development of the 44 GW Grand Inga project.

Oil prices
This week, Brent crude climbed above $95 a barrel, but ended the week at $94.10, as
supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia raised concerns of a shortfall. “Saudi Arabia
and Russia are in solid control of the oil market,” said Bjarne Schieldrop of Norwegian
bank SEB. In 2024, Brent prices are expected in the $80 and $105 per barrel range,
said Goldman Sachs.
Qatar/ Natural gas
Qatar contract awards could exceed $20 billion this year as expansion projects gain
momentum. The two expansion phases at North Field are expected to increase
Qatar’s LNG production from 77 million tpa to 126 million tpa by 2027.

Russia/ Oil and gas
Russia's oil and gas revenues are set to rise to around 733 billion roubles ($7.6 billion)
in September, up 14% from August, according to Reuters calculations. The
corresponding figure in September 2022 was 688 billion rubles.

UAE/ Oil
In August and September, the UAE began receiving the first cargoes of CPC Blend
from Russian producers. This opens up a new export route as Moscow looks to find
new customers and skirt Western sanctions. Russia is the world's third largest oil
exporter, and has rerouted most of its oil to China, India and Turkey over the past
year.

UK/ Nuclear power
The UK plans a 3.2 GW nuclear power plant, Sizewell C. But the govt is creating new
security criteria for investors. Last year, the UK bought out a Chinese company's share
in the project due to security concerns. The UK has set a target of building 24 GW of

nuclear capacity by 2050, a huge ambition that’s been met with skepticism due to the
costs.

Uruguay/ Oil exploration
State-run energy company Ancap will issue seven offshore exploration licenses. While
no oil or gas has been found in Uruguay’s waters, there’s much interest due to recent
discoveries in Namibia, across the Atlantic. 120 million years ago the two areas were
connected.

U.S./ Coal
Billionaire Michael Bloomberg pledged $500 million to fight fossil fuel power
generation. He wants to close “every last coal plant in America” and cut natural gas
capacity in half by 2030. Bloomberg already has spent over $500 million to support
the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, which originally aimed to retire 30% of the
U.S. coal fleet by 2020.
