NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







2021 emissions from energy consumption rise for the first time in eight years
(Japan NRG, Nov. 22)
•  Carbon emissions from energy consumption were 980 million tons in April 2021-March 2022, rising
1.2% YoY on the back of the post Covid recovery, METI said. The emissions were down 20.7%
from 2013.
•  Total power generation increased 3.2% to 132 tWh, while 0.46 kg of CO2 were released per kWh

of power, down 3.1% YoY. The fossil fuel share of the power mix was the lowest since 2011.
•  The energy self-sufficiency rate was 13.4%, up 2.1%.

CO2 from energy consumption
CO2 million tons     Change from 2020
Businesses                    559                  +3.8%
Households                    153                  -8.3%
Transport                     187                  +1.0%
Energy Transition             82                   +3.6%
TOTAL                         980                  +1.2%

Power supply breakdown
Fossil fuel (excluding biomass)      72.9%
Nuclear                              6.9%
Renewables                           20.3%



METI to introduce carbon fee linked to complementary carbon credit trading
(Japan NRG, Nov. 24)
•  Following last week’s announcement to delay the “full-scale launch” of carbon trades to 2026,
METI said the state will have oversight over emission caps and will set up a system to monitor cuts,
instead of leaving them entirely to “voluntary efforts” of market participants.
•  METI will introduce a system requiring importers of fossil-fuel to pay a “carbon fee” that’s linked

with an exchange-traded carbon price. The “fee” will start small, and its first adherents will benefit.
Meanwhile, existing GHG tax burdens will be reduced over time.
• TAKEAWAY: The GX League credit trading, which is in a trial phase, may require a major overhaul before 2026
because it’s not clear what the current prices represent. The exchange often reports trades of an “undefined J-
credit” or an “undefined domestic credit,” which might not be reliable references.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
MoE launches Article-6 partnership joined by 67 nations and organizations
(Government statement, Nov. 17)
o  The MoE launched the Article 6 Implementation Partnership joined by 67 nations and
organizations including the U.S., the UK, Germany, Australia, Canada, Italy, New Zealand,
Switzerland, Brazil, India and Thailand.

o  The goal is to promote an understanding of Article 6 rules on carbon credit mechanisms,
sharing experiences on authorization, technical support for international registry and
reporting, and etc.
• TAKEAWAY: The Paris Agreement Article 6 rule book aims to advance implementation of high integrity carbon
markets by coordinating international capacity building efforts. Bilateral offset mechanisms, such as Japan’s

JCM and Swiss Klik systems, were criticized as “potential carbon leakage”, but it’s gaining traction globally.



ANRE drafts CCS cost reduction goals

(Japan NRG, Nov. 22)
•  ANRE drafted CCS cost reduction goals based on studies by the state-run Research Institute of
Innovative Technologies for the Earth (RITE). The long-term goals are to reduce capture costs 75%
by 2050, carbon transport costs by 35-40%, and storage costs by 13-21%.
•  The figures will be revised as technologies develop.

Costs by ton of CO2
Present  2030       2050
Separation, capture             ¥4,000   ¥2,600   ¥1,000 or less
Pipeline transport (20 kilometers) ¥2,600 ¥2,600    ¥1,600
Ship transport (1,100 km)       ¥9,300   ¥9,300     ¥6,000
Onshore storage                 ¥6,200   ¥6,200     ¥5,400
Offshore storage                ¥6,900   ¥6,900     ¥5,400

• TAKEAWAY: Operational costs mean investments and jobs for municipalities hosting CCS. According to RITE,

CCS projects in Canada and Norway with a 1 million ton/ year capacity led to investments ranging from ¥13-
135 billion, 2,000-10,000 new jobs, and carbon tax cuts.
Competition in carbon separation and collection technologies is key to cutting costs, Mitsubishi Corp said in a
presentation to ANRE. While businesses seek state financing for all stages, ANRE proposes the government

take a role in developing large liquefied CO2 carrier ships, pumps and storage site monitoring, and
geophysical surveys.



Ruling party mulls supporting the raising of ethanol content in cars
(Japan NRG, Nov. 24)
•  The Federation of LDP Members to Promote Domestic Biofuel and Synthetic Fuel held a session to
promote domestic biofuel and synthetic fuel. Both PM Kishida and former PM Suga are supreme
advisors for the Federation.
•  Akira Amari, chairman of the Federation and a former METI minister, noted that by promoting

biofuel Japan can contribute to carbon neutrality by using internal combustion vehicles (ICVs), thus
not requiring a switch to EVs.
•  Issei Sawa, the President of Nippon Environmental Energy Development (NEED) pointed to cases
in other countries, where the ethanol blending rates are much higher at 10% to 15%. Japan has
among the lowest rates of 1.7% equivalent, because ethanol is used only for the base material of
ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE).

|  | Offshore storage |  |  | ¥6,900 |  |  | ¥6,900 |  |  | ¥5,400 |  |

•  Sawa noted that in case Japan decides to use E10, the supply of ethanol would be guaranteed by
mainly importing from the U.S. and Brazil. He also said biofuel is important for energy security.
• TAKEAWAY: Specialists say that E10 could be implemented in Japan if there is strong political support. The
caliber of politicians backing this development suggests that such support is indeed coming.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Nakagawa Bussan to market E7 gasoline
(Japan NRG, Nov. 24)
o  Nagoya-based oil products trader Nakagawa Bussan plans to market bioethanol blended
E7 gasoline (7% ethanol), in addition to E3 gasoline.

o  The company began E3 gasoline sales in 2011 and sold over 150,000 kiloliters from
November 2020 to October 2021.
• TAKEAWAY: Nakagawa Bussan would be the first company to commercialize E7 supplies in Japan. Sales
launch date and other details were not immediately available.



Working group on renewable conflicts to set up a new penalty on incompliant operators
(Japan NRG, Nov. 25)
•  The working group on renewable energy conflicts with communities will set up a new penalty
system that will improve operator compliance and encourage them to modify operations in the

early phases.
•  Incompliant operators will be required to pay a fee until they’re fully compliant. A new organization
will be set up to collect and manage the fees.
•  Serious offenders will have to refund all payments received under the feed-in premium (FIP) or
feed-in tariff (FIT) systems, and their licenses will be canceled.



ANRE proposes non-fossil fuel ratio targets for cement, automotive sectors

(Japan NRG, Nov. 22)
•  ANRE proposed a new energy efficiency target called the non-fossil fuel target for carbon intensive
industries. The cement sector is urged to increase the non-fossil fuel ratio to 28% by 2030, up from
today’s 21%; and the auto sector 59%, up from 27%.
•  Potential non-fossil fuel sources for cement include biomass, wastes, hydrogen and ammonia, as
well as fuel cells, biomass, solar, wind, and storage battery systems using recycled car batteries.
•  Grey ammonia is not a non-fossil fuel, unless there’s a clear transition roadmap to clean ammonia.

•  CONTEXT: Currently, emission cuts are voluntary efforts in each sector, although METI annually
reviews reduction progress and the sector’s 2030 goals. Measurement metrics, however, are not
consistent across sectors.
• TAKEAWAY: Industries are exploring the use of any available energy source, such as plastic wastes, sea and
river water heat, and snow; the challenge is how to effectively measure their energy levels.

supply finance for the GX of Industry”.

•  The group set three fields: Energy, Manufacturing, and Product as investment for GX. The plan is
to provide long-term financial support, from both public and private sources, to develop and
implement technology.
•  Hydrogen and offshore wind were listed as an investment target for GX.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is encouraging companies to invest in hydrogen and offshore wind, so this announcement
sends a message of support for those sectors.



Papua New Guinea becomes 25th nation to join JCM

(Japan NRG, Nov. 18)
•  Papua New Guinea joined the Joint Credit Mechanism framework, allowing Japan to transfer
carbon credits in accord with Paris Agreement rules.
•  CONTEXT: The 25 countries in JCM are all non-Annex I parties determined to be vulnerable to
climate change under the definition of UNFCCC. There are around 150 non-Annex I parties.
Japan’s goal is to invite 30 partner countries to JCM by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: Malaysia, Singapore, Nepal, India and China are major non-Annex I parties in Asia but have not
yet joined JCM.



Japan group starts research on massive floating wind turbines

(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 24)
•  Construction firm Toda and Osaka University will explore building floating offshore wind platforms
that are three times larger than current ones.
•  The research involves developing a structure that can support huge floating turbines with an
output of 12 to 15 MW. Experiments will start in 2025. A smaller 10 MW-class unit may be ready by
2024.
•  CONTEXT: Floating turbines are more complex and expensive than those fixed to the sea floor.

Japan’s deep waters make floating technology important for the future development of the
offshore wind power industry. Toda also leads the consortium of eight Japanese companies that
won the rights to create Japan's first commercial floating offshore wind project off the coast of
Nagasaki Prefecture. There is currently one 2 MW turbine in the water, operated by Toda, and it
sells electricity to the grid.



Mitsubishi Corp led group looks to produce synthetic methane in the U.S.

(Nikkan Kogyo, Nov. 25)
•  Mitsubishi Corporation, Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, and Toho Gas are reviewing a project to produce
synthetic methane in the U.S. using hydrogen derived from renewable energy, and to export it to
Japan.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The final investment decision will be made in 2025, and production could start in 2029. Project
outline sees the potential for Japan to import 130,000 tons of synthetic methane per year from the
start of the next decade.
•  A candidate site for the production is an LNG project in Louisiana, in which Mitsubishi is an
investor. Renewable energy may be developed by the consortium themselves or acquired from

local suppliers. The basic project design should be ready in 2024, though the companies involved
will seek state subsidies to support the development.
•  CONTEXT: If realized, this will be the world's first project to produce synthetic methane from
hydrogen and CO2.
• TAKEAWAY: Recently, Japan’s gas industry association has called for a renaming of the synthetic methane or
methanation as “e-methane”, to make the product stand out more. There is clearly a lot of industrial interest in

Japan, especially from the gas community, in seeing a shift to e-methane as it would help retain most of the
existing infrastructure. However, concerns remain about how to measure the CO2 involved and the economics.


Mitsubishi Heavy to Test Ammonia Co-Firing in Taiwan

(Company Statement, Nov. 17)
•  Engineering major agreed with Taiwanese state-owned firm Taiwan Power Company (TPC) to
conduct a study on introducing ammonia co-firing at the Linkou Thermal Power Plant in Linkou
District, New Taipei.
•  CONTEXT: The Linkou Power Plant is located approximately 20 km west of central Taipei. It
comprises three supercritical coal-fired boilers and steam turbines supplied by MHI, with a total

capacity of 2.4 GW.
•  Phase 1 through 2025 will be a basic study of ammonia co-firing at a 5% ratio. Later, that ratio will
rise to 20% by around 2030.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Sumitomo Corp to with with Indonesian power utility PLN on the energy transition
(Company Statement, Nov. 17)
o  The trading house and P.T. Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), a state-owned power

company in Indonesia, inked a deal to jointly study the development of new renewables
projects and the early transfer and retirement of existing coal-fired power plants.
o  CONTEXT: Indonesia relies mostly on coal-fired generation but has set 2060 as its net-
zero deadline.
o  PLN aims to increase the ratio of renewable energy power generation projects from 20%
in 2020 to 30% by 2035 on an equity capacity basis, and will study new projects through
a collaboration with Sumitomo.

• TAKEAWAY: MHI and Sumitomo are among the Japanese firms seeking to export the nation’s decarbonization
technology and strategy to Southeast Asia. MHI has also recently signed an MoU with Thailand’s largest power
producer, Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), to study clean power generation, hydrogen,
carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies.

Yamaha Motor to switch to plant-based resin for marine transport
(Kankyo Business, Nov. 18)
•  Yamaha Motor will start to use a plant-derived cellulose nanofiber reinforced resin for its marine
products in 2024. This is the world's first practical application of a bio-based material in

transportation equipment parts.
•  The material will be used for engine parts of watercraft and sport boats (some of the 2024 models).
In the future, Yamaha expects to use the material in a wide range of other products, including
motorcycles. The material is jointly developed with Nippon Paper Industries.
•  The resin is produced by kneading and dispersing cellulose nanofiber, a biomass material that
utilizes wood resources, into polypropylene and other resins. Compared to existing resin materials,

the new resin is 25% lighter. It also is also easy to recycle.
• TAKEAWAY: Though small-scale and seemingly minor, these kinds of replacements of materials will be one of
the biggest factors behind the shift away from fossil fuels.



JERA might order mega-tankers to carry ammonia
(Nikkei, Nov. 21)
•  JERA, Mitsui OSK Lines, and NYK are discussing the use of two or three super tankers to transport
ammonia for use in coal-fired power stations.
•  If the proposal goes ahead, shipments would begin in 2027/28.
•  Each tanker would cost around $95 million and carry up to 60,000 metric tons of ammonia,
making the tankers among the world’s largest.
•  While JERA is experimenting with coal/ ammonia blends that have about 20% ammonia, it aims
to make 50-50 blends commercially viable by the early 2030s.

Japan to resume wind auctions in December, but Mitsubishi will not
(Diamond, Reuters, Japan NRG, Nov. 26)
•  In December, Japan is poised to resume public auctions for offshore wind power projects in four
new areas, for a total of 1.8 GW.
•  Revised rules will apply for the upcoming auction: giving higher evaluation scores to operators that

submit earlier start-up dates, setting a 1 GW limit on the bids one consortium can win; and all bids
below the market level will receive the same score on the pricing criteria, to discourage throat-cut
price competition.
•  It seems, however, that Mitsubishi Corporation, which won all three of the major offshore wind
auctions last year, will not participate this time. The trading house put a small notice put in the
Official Gazette (Kanpo) on Nov. 11 that said its relevant group company will not take part in the
bidding for the projects in Happo Town and Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture.
•  Mitsubishi initially planned to bid, but auction rule changes seem to prevent the company from

taking all of Akita area projects. What’s more, the economic and geopolitical situation that has
developed this year has pushed up the cost of large offshore wind projects and Mitsubishi fears
the profitability of its existing projects might be compromised.

Akita governor asks for more details in Noshiro-Mitane-Oga offshore wind project
(Japan NRG, Nov. 21)
o  The governor of Akita Prefecture, a host site of the Mitsubishi consortium’s offshore wind

farm, requested clarity for the dimensions and methods, and to keep local stakeholders
informed of details.
o  The governor also mentioned the other wind farms in operation in the area and that the
consortium needs to assess how they would be impacted.
o  Wind power turbines have caused radio-wave interference in some parts of Akita and the
governor asked the operator to take appropriate measures.

o  CONTEXT: The governor’s opinions are a part of the regulatory process and public
disclosure of project details. Mitsubishi consortium’s proposed Noshiro-Mitane-Oga wind
farm will be a 479 MW project slated to begin operation in 2028. The Mitsubishi
consortium was awarded the project along with the Yurihonjo and Choshi projects in the
December 2021 auction, triggering complaints and auction rule changes.
• TAKEAWAY: Authorities are tightening renewables regulations, and Akita Prefecture, a host of four major
offshore wind projects, is no exception. From April 2022, new environmental impact assessment rules have

taken effect. Wind farms over 10 MW need to conduct the assessment, which is stricter than the MoE rule that
says projects below 37.5 MW are exempt.

Power and gas prices set to rise again as Tokyo calls for energy saving
(Japan NRG, Jiji, Nov. 27)
•  At least six major power companies, including TEPCO, will apply to METI soon to ask for an
increase in the household tariffs. Meanwhile, Tokyo Gas plans to raise gas prices for residential

consumers over a six-month period starting in May.
Tohoku Electric is the first power company to lodge an application. It is appealing for the ministry
to green-light an average increase of about a third from April 2023. Most of the smaller EPCOs
plan a similar application.
•  METI usually takes about four months to review tariff changes, which indicates that price increases
would come in April or May. Gas increases for businesses are likely to be delayed until 2024.

TEPCO’s application will likely come later than the rest.
•  The government will introduce a ¥7/ kWh subsidy for electricity from January to cover the increase
in rates in the spring. However, the increases sought by the power utilities would exceed the
subsidy amounts.
•  Households pay electricity based on regulated tariffs and so-called free rates, which power firms
can revise on their own.
•  Meanwhile, Tokyo has rolled out an energy savings campaign titled “HTT” this winter. This calls for

people to reduce consumption, save on energy use when possible, including by wearing sweaters
and other warm clothing indoors, and look for ways to cut electricity use in general, such as by
switching to LED lighting.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE proposes restricting gas supplies to 3,300 big users during shortage
(Japan NRG, Nov. 22)
o  In times of extreme shortage ANRE proposes restricting gas supplies to big consumers of

over 0.5 million m3/ year, or 3,300 consumers. This follows Gas Business Law
amendments passed by parliament on Nov 11.
o  The public will be notified of supply restrictions one month in advance. The METI
minister will either issue advice or an order that penalizes incompliance. The law doesn’t
state who will be subject to restriction.
• TAKEAWAY: PM Kishida plans a stimulus that will support large end-users to the tune of ¥30/ cubic meter and
reduce electricity bills. Although supply restrictions are for extreme emergencies, it will still be odd if some

users continue to enjoy discounts.

Japan Fair Trade Commission mulls high penalty to grids on alleged cartel charge
(NHK, Nov. 26)
•  The Japan Fair Trade Commission is considering imposing administrative penalties on Chubu
Electric, Chugoku Electric, Kyushu Electric and Kansai Electric, which are accused of ‘cartel
charges’. If the penalty is imposed then the amount could be tens of billions of yen.
•  Starting in 2018, the grids allegedly restrained competition for corporate users by dividing up

•  CONTEXT: Last year, the JFTC conducted two dawn raids which included Toho Gas. However,
Toho Gas was not included in the media report possibly because it’s not facing charges, or it may
have applied for leniency and surcharge fees were reduced.
• TAKEAWAY: Cartel cases with wide social impact are given to prosecutors’ offices to file criminal charges. The
prosecutors can issue prison sentences and fines, while JFTC’s authority is limited to “surcharges”, a type of

penalty that is not entirely a “fine”.
• The grids may have escaped criminal charges but will likely face shareholder complaints on corporate
governance. Many companies facing cartel charges have appealed their cases to courts, in order to avoid

shareholder suits against the companies and their directors.
• According to some media reports, the alleged cartel is believed to have operated until at least the summer of
2020 and involved largely "extra high-voltage electricity" for large factories and "high-voltage electricity" for
businesses.

Japan: Energy Dinosaur or Innovator?

For most of the past decade Japan has been a favorite punching bag of the activist
wing of the environmental movement. Almost each year, for example, the Climate
Action Network (CAN) bestows an infamous ‘award’ upon Japan for its use of oil, gas
and coal, which account for more than half of the national energy mix.

The most recent barb came on Nov 10 when CAN presented Japan with its satirical
honor, “Fossil of the Day”, at the UN climate change conference in Egypt, (COP27),
accusing Tokyo of not taking sufficient measures to promote green energy and
combat climate change.

"The Japanese government is making huge efforts to export false solutions,” stated
CAN, also criticizing Prime Minister Kishida for not attending the leaders' summit,
saying, "Maybe he was too busy promoting false solutions in Japan?”

Those accusations of “false solutions” were likely a reference to Japan’s policy of
developing and exporting a technology that would over time allow coal plants to also
burn ammonia. This approach would prolong the use of such plants while gradually
cutting GHG emissions as clean-burning ammonia takes over from coal. Activists,
however, want the coal-powered stations closed entirely and now.

Ironically, the CAN ‘award’ came on the same day when Chinese officials at COP27
unabashedly announced plans to expand the nation’s already massive fleet of coal-
fired power plants. While Beijing also promotes wind and solar generation, it
reportedly plans another 270 GW of coal-fired capacity, more than any country has
installed today.

The last time China won the “Fossil of the Day” award was in 2013.

PR stunts such as the Fossil award are designed to grab headlines and exploit
sensational photo ops — a person dressed as a dinosaur handed the ‘award’ to
someone acting for the Japanese ‘delegation’. That image was widely disseminated in
global media, creating the false impression of Japan as an energy ‘dinosaur’.

Does Japan really deserve this disparaging treatment? The facts tell a more complex
story – Tokyo continues to push forward with numerous renewable energy projects
and cleantech innovations. Certainly, much more needs to be done, but the highly
industrialised and resource-poor Japan is making important strides to advance the
clean energy agenda.


Green innovations
During COP27 and over the past few weeks, Japanese agencies and companies had
plenty to boast of. Let’s recap. First, Tokyo Governor Koike introduced a plan to build
a supply chain for green hydrogen, including trunk lines for imports, and she also
presented Tokyo’s 2050 decarbonization plan.

Meanwhile, half a world away, during the Reuters energy transition conference in
Houston, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration (an ENEOS subsidiary) signed with 8 Rivers
Capital (North Carolina) for global collaboration on decarbonization of power systems
and hydrogen power generation.

Also at the conference, a speaker from the U.S. Department of Energy praised Japan
for pioneering the bi-directional battery for EVs. Developed by Tsubaki in Osaka, the
eLINK is a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) compatible charging system that connects EVs
with buildings and power grids (V2G). It’s seen as a game changer for the entire
energy industry; in effect turning EVs into mobile storage batteries whose power can
be recalled to the grid at any moment for any purpose.

Then, the following week, on Nov 16, some of Japan’s leading energy companies,
including INPEX, Osaka Gas, ENEOS, Idemitsu, Chubu Electric, and Acario (Tokyo
Gas) held a cleantech event at the Plug and Play Tech Center in Silicon Valley in
California to promote opportunities in Japan’s energy sector.

The above is just a small sampling of Japan’s ‘green’ credentials in the past few
weeks, and it calls into question the narrative of Japan as a plodding and moribund
energy dinosaur facing extinction.

In line with its 2050 carbon-neutral plans, the country’s energy policy calls for solar,
wind and other renewable energy to account for 36-38% of the electricity mix by
2030, double the level of a decade of 2020. Coal-generated power is expected to
drop to 19% of the power mix, from the current 26%. Gas use would be halved to
22% of the total.

The country is setting up an offshore wind power sector from scratch and aims to take
the global lead in floating turbine technology.

Outside of electricity, Japan is using state funds to support R&D into lower energy use
in homes and buildings; the elimination of coal use in steelmaking; lower CO2
emissions from cement; and better energy efficiency among the population.

Progress is clearly being made. Is it fast enough? For the more radical wing of the
clean energy movement, it’s not.

During COP27, activists found support from the U.N. General Secretary António
Guterres, who unleashed an emotional and gloomy barrage: “We’re in the fight of our
lives, and we’re losing… our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make
climate chaos irreversible. We’re on a highway to climate hell with our still foot on the
accelerator.”


Reality bites
As the repercussions of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions related to it
took hold, most nations turned their attention to energy security. Japan has always
stated energy security as its biggest concern and it has cause to do so.

According to METI, Japan’s energy primary self-sufficiency rate is 11%, much lower
than in any other G7 country (U.S: 106%; Canada: 179%; UK: 75%; France: 55%; and


19


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Germany: 35%). Therefore, any immediate withdrawal from fossil fuel projects without
an alternative in place would hurt Japan tremendously.

While activists can enjoy pulling off satirical antics, energy executives must deal with
the reality of providing clients and the global community with affordable and reliable
energy supplies. The Houston energy conference questioned making speed the only
focus of the energy transition.

“We need economic security and sustainability while decarbonizing,” said Alan
Armstrong, CEO of Williams, a U.S. natural gas processing and transportation
company. “We need to provide affordable energy; let’s come up with solutions that
deliver lower emissions in an economically sustainable way.”

The emphasis here is on “economically”, and Armstrong suggested that natural gas is
a way to lower emissions right here, right now. Gas, however, must confront the
malignant label of “fossil fuel”.

Former head of BP, Bob Dudley, chimed in that: “I thought the [Russian] invasion
would accelerate the energy transition. But now we see the opposite. We need
natural gas.”

Such words are a balm on the soul of many METI bureaucrats, and underscore the fact
that sarcastic accusations and mockery aimed at countries deemed ‘dinosaurs’ –
because they must grapple with energy security – does not advance the global energy
transition. Instead, it only heightens mistrust.

As countries decarbonize there’ll be different options in different places. There isn't a
one-solution-fits-all. As Japan makes its own way toward net-zero, the “fossils” it
leaves behind are memories of a not-so-terrible past, not signposts for the future.

AND YURIY HUMBER
METI Sees Trouble With Local Communities

A Key Challenge to Meeting Japan’s 2050 Net-Zero Goal

Historically, Japanese officials have a proud record of steering the domestic power
industry along the lines written in national policy and strategy. Bureaucrats paved the
way for Japan to harness its hydro resources; develop its coal; then shift to crude oil
and nuclear; and pioneer the mass transport of a super-chilled molecule that’s now
critical to the nation’s electricity grid.

At first, this prowess seemed to transfer to the age of renewables. In 2012, a newly
minted FIT program started a boom in solar generation. But a decade in, progress has
stalled, all at a time when the latest government Basic Energy Plan points to a further
doubling of renewables capacity this decade. This year’s heightened energy security
concerns also suggest more effort on the renewables front is necessary.

There are many well-documented factors behind the recent slowdown in solar. Yet,
upon examination, METI bureaucrats have determined that perhaps one of the main
ones is: They lost control of the conversation.

Mass-scale construction of infrastructure involves a complex dialog between
stakeholders, including local governments, citizens, utilities and others. When Japan’s
power industry was covered by less than a dozen companies that took care of
everything from fuel to electrons and delivery to the client’s socket, METI could guide
that conversation. Yet the nature of solar and wind power, with hundreds of small and
medium-sized players involved, and the market’s 2016 liberalization, has created a
very different set of circumstances that perhaps caught officials by surprise.


We need to talk
At first glance, Japan’s energy policy machine has performed as usual to further the
goal of decarbonization first announced by former PM Suga in October 2020. A new
Basic Energy Plan was formed; it set out an ambitious target to double the role of
renewables, as per the national agenda; and a plethora of committees, panels and
working groups sprang up to ensure that Japan had the various roadmaps necessary
to reach net-zero.

When Kishida took the prime minister’s office about a year ago, he mostly kept Suga’s
policies in place. Perhaps the most notable tweak has been the renaming of the net-
zero agenda as “Green Transformation” or “GX”.

Yet as the control center for the GX revolution, the GX Council, picks up the pace of
its meetings and adds ever more promises of new tools and finances, the pace of
change on the ground has slowed. In large part that’s because much of what the
government wants to do actually relies on the actions of other stakeholders, such as
local governments, citizens, grid planners, and project developers. This is as true for
nuclear restarts as it is for the construction of new renewables capacity.

21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Kishida’s answer has been to set up a new government panel: the “Working group for
sustainable use and coexistence with community”, which sits under METI’s Advisory
Committee for Natural Resources and Energy.

While the creation of yet another working group might sound like the last thing that
the renewables sector needs, this platform could prove quite important.

Over the last ten years, solar capacity has jumped by a factor of 12. Inevitably, it has
involved both reputable firms and those with less scrupulous motives. In some cases,
projects were rushed, built on land not appropriate for construction, or simply without
adequate local consultation. The number of renewables projects which, according to
METI, are classed as “troubled cases” has jumped from 26 in 2017 to 184 in 2021.

As the volume of troubled cases grows, and readily available land for new
developments shrinks, tensions between developers and local stakeholders are
spilling over into the communities and the pages of national newspapers.

The new working group comes in as an independent arbiter to unravel these knots.


Troubled cases of RE projects are up sevenfold since 2016

The grid strikes back
Some of the issues that affect citizens in rural communities were detailed by Japan
NRG in the Oct. 31 and Nov. 21 reports this year. But there are other causes of
friction.

Before power market liberalization, Japanese power utilities controlled both electricity
generation and transmission. Since 2016, these business units have been split, but in
many cases, they remain within the same holding structure. For example, TEPCO
Power Grid is part of TEPCO Holding, which also owns a thermal power generation
business (TEPCO Fuel & Power) and a green energy company (TEPCO Renewable
Power).
So, while TEPCO Grid performs the role of an independent electricity network
operator for the Greater Tokyo area, it has to balance the needs of two TEPCO
generation companies with those of other local power providers. Furthermore, the


22


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

renewables unit of TEPCO is competing with other solar and wind developers in the
area for grid connection and capacity.

Grid operators claim that balancing the output of a high number of small, distributed
energy assets, the output of which is hard to forecast in advance, is becoming more
and more technically challenging. But the situation is further exacerbated by failures
of communication.
Power transmission and distribution firms claim that some solar developers do not
follow requests to stop generation when requested to do so for network maintenance.
This leads to higher grid costs because maintenance work or new construction has to
be conducted after dark, when solar panels are inactive, triggering staff over-time fees
and other costs.

Current regulation is not able to force a generator to stop or curtail output. It can only
be made as a request.

Also, renewables developers are more likely to diverge from their project schedule,
which is submitted to the local grid to say when the power capacity will be available.
According to a report by the Transmission & Distribution Grid Council, developers of
renewable energy facilities registered 473 changes to their project schedule in the
three years through 2021. Transmission firms only made 31 changes in the same
period.

Solar, wind and biomass developers often have a good reason to alter their schedules
due to issues with land acquisition, financing, or equipment. Grid operators, however,
like to plan long-term and appear less flexible to respond to changes.


Green local government
Inadequate local government resources and know-how in dealing with renewables
projects is another issue slowing new RE capacity. In 2019, Tokyo-based developer
Blue Capital Management won permission to build a 28.8 MW solar project at
Kannami town in Shizuoka Prefecture. The plan was to lay 100,000 solar panels in an
intermountain area.

In November 2022, however, the prefectural assembly questioned the project, saying
that an appropriate local river survey had not been done. The project was
greenlighted by the town as it passed the Urban Planning Act, but the officials in
charge are now being questioned. As a result, the developer is being asked to redo
the river survey and revise part of their plans in order to prevent possible flooding in
the area.
Some municipalities are also asking developers to have additional meetings with local
governments and citizens to avert future disruptions. For example, Okazaki City in
Aichi Prefecture requires developers to meet with the mayor before construction
starts, and hold meetings with local residents at least three times.

As a result, renewables projects take longer to complete. That’s why a better work
flow is required to manage the conversation between industry and local stakeholders.

It won’t be an easy task to create a smoother process that municipalities across Japan
can adopt. Still, METI is optimistic. The deadline for its new working group to come
up with a solution is the end of the year.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Brazil/ Biodiesel
The new government reaffirmed support for biodiesel fuel and will keep the blending
mandate at a higher level than currently. A decision by the previous government to
keep the mandatory biodiesel blend in diesel at 10% until March 31 will be revoked.

CO2 emissions
About 36.6 billion tons of CO2 will be emitted globally this year from coal, natural gas
and oil, slightly more than the previous record in 2019, a 1% increase, reports the
Global Carbon Project. China leads with 32% of total emissions, the U.S. with 14%,
and the EU and India, both with 8%.

China/ Assets sale
CNOOC seeks to sell $2 billion of its assets in the U.S. due to concerns over
sanctions. CNOOC owns shale assets onshore and stakes in fields in the Gulf of
Mexico. These concerns might impact CNOOC assets in the North Sea and Canada.

China/ Natural gas
China signed $60 billion in LNG deals with Qatar Energy. Each year starting in 2026,
and lasting for 27 years, Sinopec will receive 4 million tons of LNG annually. This will
be China's longest LNG supply contract and one of the largest in volume.

EVs/ Batteries
The U.S. and EU must invest $160 billion by 2030 to cut dependence on China for EV
batteries, said Goldman Sachs. China produces 75% of the world’s batteries and
dominates production of their materials and components.

Italy/ Energy transition
Enel will sell €21 billion in assets to cut debt of nearly €52 billion. The company will
focus on six core countries in the EU and U.S. to develop renewable energy. It will sell
its natural gas assets in Spain and withdraw from Argentina and Peru.

Natural gas/ Price cap
Intercontinental Exchange warned the European Commission that a natural gas price
cap could destabilize the entire market. Energy traders that rely on the Dutch TTF
futures market face an 80% rise in insurance payments to secure deals.

Netherlands/ Hydrogen power
The government has a €22 million subsidy plan for hydrogen refueling stations for
trucks. Expected to start in early 2024, the subsidy will apply if both a filling station is
built and the trucks purchased.

| About 36.6 billion tons of CO2 will be emitted globally this year from coal, natural gas |
| --- |
| and oil, slightly more than the previous record in 2019, a 1% increase, reports the |
| Global Carbon Project. China leads with 32% of total emissions, the U.S. with 14%, |
| and the EU and India, both with 8%. |

Russia/ Oil price caps
The G7’s proposed price cap of $65-$70 a barrel on Russian oil will have little
immediate impact on Moscow's revenues, because it’s in line with what Asian buyers
are now paying, said a Reuters report.

UK/ Battery storage
Europe's largest energy storage system began operating near Hull. The site can store
enough electricity to power 300,000 homes for two hours. The facility was developed
by Harmony Energy using technology made by Tesla.

Ukraine/ Power blackouts
The state energy utility said damage to infrastructure from Russian attacks meant that
“the vast majority of electricity consumers were cut off”; some major cities, such Kiev
and Lvov, are mostly in the dark. Rolling blackouts will continue until March.
