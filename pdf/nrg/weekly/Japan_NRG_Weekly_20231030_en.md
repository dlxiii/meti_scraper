JAEA nuclear fusion project generates super hot plasma, milestone for clean energy
(Nikkei Asia, Oct 25)
•  Japan's fusion power project at the JT-60SA research center has generated super hot plasma,
marking a breakthrough. This means it generated a high-temperature cloud of ionized atoms,
taking a step closer to the goal of creating an experimental fusion reactor.
•  This program is run by the Naka Fusion Institute of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA).
•  JT-60SA in the city of Naka is one of the world’s largest plasma research facilities; it aims to

harness fusion as a clean energy source using heavy hydrogen from seawater and generating less
radioactive waste compared to fission reactors.
•  CONTEXT: Fusion, the process that powers the sun, involves merging atomic nuclei to produce
energy, unlike fission, which splits atoms. For 37 years Japan’s nuclear fusion program has
centered around JT60 and its successor, JT60SA, (short for Japan Torus-60).
• TAKEAWAY: In 2022, PM Kishida said nuclear fusion is part of his clean energy strategy, and he allowed

startups in the field to claim state support. However, fusion energy projects remain highly experimental. At
best, optimistic experts only expect it to be commercially viable by 2035. Meanwhile, more pessimistic experts
doubt it will ever be commercially viable because, they say, the technological challenges are so great that the
vast development and operational costs would make it unprofitable as a commercial energy source.




Japan, Danish PMs meet to promote floating offshore wind, establish global standards
(Nikkei, Oct 24)
•  The Danish PM visited Tokyo to meet PM Kishida, and offshore wind was one of the main topics
they discussed.
•  Denmark and Japan plan to focus on floating offshore wind power generation, and want to come

up with global standards for the sector.
•  Experts from both countries’ industry and academia will work together to find ways to reduce
development costs and electricity generation.
•  Japan is attractive for Danish companies; it has shipbuilding technology needed for floating
equipment, and it promises to be a major offshore wind market. Japanese companies with
expertise in floating structures include Japan Marine United, Modec and Hitachi Zosen.

•  CONTEXT: Denmark is a leader in offshore wind power, home to giants like wind turbine maker
Vestas and Orsted, the world's leading wind turbine operator. Floating offshore wind platforms will
be located much further from shore than stationary offshore wind farms, allowing them to harness
more powerful winds. Another advantage is that there will be much fewer potential conflicts with
local communities.
• TAKEAWAY: Floating offshore wind is still highly experimental and in its nascent stage. Globally, in 2020, its

total installed capacity was a mere 17 MW. But about a dozen countries, such as Japan, are placing much hope

in floating offshore wind as part of efforts to decarbonize their energy sector. Japan’s GX calls for 30-45 GW of
offshore wind power capacity by 2040, with floating turbines seen as taking over the wind sector once it gets
fully established in the 2030s.




Japan’s energy sector seeks to move away from Chinese supplies after detention
(Japan NRG, Oct 25)
•  Battery and magnetic motor manufacturers will step up the shift away from Chinese supplies on the

news of Beijing detaining a Japanese company employee in March, industry sources told Japan
NRG.
•  The detained employee is a Chinese national working for a nonferrous metal trading firm. He was
believed to be dealing with rare metals.
•  Japanese businesses are canceling trips to China, which may possibly lead to termination of
contracts with Chinese suppliers.
• TAKEAWAY: The detention was not an isolated incident. Earlier in October, China formally arrested a senior

Japanese executive at pharma company Astellas after detaining him since March on espionage charges. The
executive had spent a large part of his career in China and was on the brink of retirement. Earlier this year,
China had revised its legislation to broaden the range of activities it considers to be espionage.
• In the commodities business, the sharing of data is often part of the process of creating a market. Publishers of

international energy price indices rely on market participants voluntarily disclosing details of their deals. Not
many Japanese companies take part in the process, but those few who do might now recheck price publisher
data management policies. Businesses are improving measures to protect employees as well as data.
However, according to Japanese experts speaking at the recent Tokyo-Beijing Forum, there is now uncertainty
about where Chinese legal lines lie.




Subsidies intended to mitigate energy price hikes will be reduced in May 2024
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 25)
•  The govt’s draft for a comprehensive economic package stipulates that measures to alleviate the

drastic hikes in electricity and gas prices will continue at their current level until late April 2024.
•  These measures were set to expire in December. While they will now continue, the extent of such
support will nevertheless be reduced starting in May 2024, but details are not yet known.
•  Since September, measures to alleviate the drastic changes in electricity and gas prices have been
subsidized at ¥3.5/ kWh for low voltage, and ¥1.8 for high voltage.
•  For urban gas, the subsidy is ¥15/ cubic meter for households and companies with annual contract

quantities of under 10 million cubic meters.

METI 2050 hydrogen outlook too conservative: Japan Hydrogen Association
(Japan NRG, Oct 25)
•  METI’s 2050 hydrogen demand outlook of 20 million tons is far too conservative; the Japan
Hydrogen Association sees a potential demand at 69.45 million tons, an association official told a

hydrogen safety panel.
•  Demand from the power sector alone will account for 16 million tons and from other industries
around 35 million tons. It will all be in the form of green hydrogen.

Potential hydrogen demand breakdown (million tons)
Sector         Hydrogen demand
Power          15.75

Transport      16.01

(Company statement, Oct 26)
•  Mitsubishi Power Americas made its first equipment delivery for the Hydaptive hydrogen
production plant that’s part of the Advanced Clean Energy Storage Hub (ACES Delta Hub) in
Utah.
•  The ACES Delta Hub, a collaboration between Mitsubishi Power Americas and Chevron, aims to

produce, store, and supply green hydrogen. Once operational, each day it will convert 220 MW of
renewable energy into nearly 100 tons of green hydrogen, storing it in two vast salt caverns.
•  A pipeline from the hub will supply hydrogen to the InterMountain Power Agency’s power plant,
whose turbines will use up to 30% hydrogen blended with natural gas at start-up, with a goal of
transitioning to 100% hydrogen by 2045 or sooner.




Itochu and Orascom to develop ammonia bunkering in Suez Canal
(Company statement, Oct 25)
•  Itochu signed an MoU with Orascom Construction to develop ammonia bunkering in the Suez
Canal. This is a step toward building a global ammonia supply chain and the development of
ammonia-fueled ships.
•  Itochu is also developing ammonia bunkering hubs in Singapore, Spain, various other European

ports, the Panama Canal, and Japan.
•  The company’s decarbonization strategy includes building ammonia-powered ships, and
participating in green ammonia production.

the goal of competing with electric trucks.
•  The vehicle will combine Isuzu's light truck body with Toyota's fuel cell technology. Its production

location is yet to be determined.
•  FCVs offer longer ranges and cargo capacity compared to electric trucks.
•  CONTEXT: The market for commercial FCVs is expected to grow as logistics companies aim to
reduce their carbon footprint. Challenges include the cost of hydrogen and the need to expand
the hydrogen filling station network.




Mitsubishi Motors invests €200 million in Renault’s EV subsidiary ahead of public listing
(Company statement, Oct 24)
•  Mitsubishi Motors will invest €200 million in Ampere, an EV and automotive software company
founded by Renault Group in late 2022.
•  By the end of this year, Ampere plans to go public. The company has pledged to produce 1

million EVs annually by 2031.
•  With this investment, Mitsubishi Motors aims to improve its EV development technology.
•  CONTEXT: Renault seeks to become a “next-gen automotive company”. Mitsubishi Motors is a
member of the Alliance with Renault and Nissan, and in 2009 it launched the i-MiEV –the world's
first mass-produced EV, followed by the Outlander PHEV – the world's first plug-in hybrid electric
SUV in 2013.




Idemitsu, FOMM ink MoU to study EV collaborations
(Company statement, Oct 26)
•  Idemitsu Kosan and First One Mile Mobility (FOMM) inked an MoU on cooperation.
•  This might include the launch of EV-related services at Idemitsu gasoline service stations, such as
converting small engine vehicles to EVs by replacing engines with electric motors, battery

replacement and maintenance services of FOMM EV models.
•  CONTEXT: Founded in 2013 by a former Suzuki Motor engineer, FOMM is an emerging
automotive maker focused on EVs. Its newest service will allow gasoline-powered car owners to
convert their vehicles into electric ones by remodeling and installing a battery and motor.
• TAKEAWAY: In 2021, Cosmo Energy signed a similar agreement with EV manufacturer ASF. While Idemitsu’s
MoU with FOMM doesn’t include investments, the final agreement will reveal Idemitsu’s ultimate ambition in
the EV space: Does it aim to evolve into an automotive manufacturer, or focus on batteries? The company has

ties with Toyota Motor in solid battery production.

MoE subsidies to push data centers toward increased renewable energy use
(Japan NRG, Oct 25)
•  The MoE will expand subsidies to push data centers toward increased renewable energy
consumption, said Kato Daisuke, deputy director of the Climate Change Projects Office, during
Japan IT Week in Chiba.
•  The subsidies began in FY2021, funding data centers that introduce on-site renewable energy

systems. So far, about 25 projects have received subsidies. Kato aims to expand the plan to
include battery installations, building-integrated solar systems and energy-efficient cooling systems
starting in FY2025.
•  CONTEXT: Data centers are purchasing green power and non-fossil fuel certificates but the MoE
wants to change this. It forecasts the data center sector’s power consumption rising to 150 TWh in
2030, up from 16 GWh in 2017, and there may not be enough certificates.
• TAKEAWAY: Data center power consumption is likely to exceed the MoE’s forecast. Covid-19 led to an

increase in data traffic, especially with more video streaming. That traffic will only increase because video is
going 3D with the rise of the metaverse and AI-driven “XR” (virtual, augmented and mixed reality)
technologies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Mibai City to expand carbon neutral data center
(Japan NRG, Oct 25)
o  Mibai City (Hokkaido) plans to expand its carbon-neutral data center that uses snow to
cool servers. The data center was built in 2021 with 20 racks of servers consuming 3,000
tons of snow.
o  One ton of snow cuts 10 liters of oil-equivalent energy consumption. Water from melted

snow is transported to the data center through pipelines. The city is considering biogas
and solar power as the data center’s main power sources.
o  The extent of the expansion depends on the number of interested users.
o  CONTEXT: New Chitose International Airport (Hokkaido) and Imperial Hotel (Tokyo) use
snow-based systems to control building temperatures.
• TAKEAWAY: Snow does not cost the data center anything, but the labor and fuel cost of collecting and

transporting it has an impact, a city official told Japan NRG. Meanwhile, another data center operator said that
customers seek resilience against earthquakes and floods, and that emissions are still a low priority.

SoftBank to build data center with Japan’s largest power demand
(Nikkei, October 20)
•  SoftBank seeks to build a large-scale data center in Hokkaido by FY2026. The company has
applied for a subsidy from METI for half the construction costs, which are expected to be in the

range of ¥40 to ¥60 billion.
•  The volume of data is expected to grow rapidly with the spread of AI and other tech. There are
concerns that clusters of data centers in Japan’s urban areas will increase power consumption,
which is why companies seek decentralized data center projects.
•  SoftBank estimates it will need 300 MW of power capacity for the Hokkaido center, which would
make it Japan’s biggest power consumer in the sector. It also wants the electricity to come from
renewable energy sources so that the data center is “green”.

•  The site is planned for Tomakomai City.
• TAKEAWAY: A report earlier this month estimated that the catchment area served by TEPCO also will require
7 GW of new power capacity over the next ten or so years to meet demand from new data centers. One of the
biggest clusters for such new facilities is forming in the city of Inzai, Chiba Pref, which has a population of just
over 100,000 but will require 2.5 GW of new capacity by 2035 to meet data center needs. That’s equivalent to
building two and a half nuclear reactors. Softbank’s choice of location in Hokkaido should help to support new

solar, wind and battery capacity in the region. But the site near Tomakomai will also need to compete for
green energy with a new semiconductor hub that the govt plans to establish in nearby Chitose City.




Mitsubishi proposes changes in offshore wind auction and FIP systems
(Government statement, Oct 27)
•  A unit of Japan’s biggest trading house, Mitsubishi Corporation, made offshore wind policy
recommendations to the METI Power Tariff Committee, saying high costs are impacting projects
overseas and Japan could find itself facing the same issues.
•  The company suggested that future project auction price caps should reflect prevailing market

conditions, and called for the introduction of a new mechanism in the Feed-in-Premium system
that allows increased flexibility in setting the govt purchase rates for electricity from offshore wind
farms.
•  If auction cap prices are below the leveraged cost of electricity (LCOE), future offshore wind
auctions may not draw any participants, the company warned.
• TAKEAWAY: For years, governments around the world have scaled back the price offered at wind and solar
auctions to benefit from over a decade of cost reductions in both sectors. But the last two years or so have

seen a marked reversal in costs due to inflation, rising raw materials prices, and supply constraints. In Japan,
the cost of wind power is up by almost a third in this time and the industry supply chains are still at an early
stage of development. Mitsubishi is clearly trying to get the officials in Tokyo to notice the situation in Europe.
Last month, the UK saw no bids entered in its latest round of offshore wind auctions last month after industry
players felt the price cap proposed by the government was too low to allow for a profit.

• There is another factor worth noting in this development. After Mitsubishi won all three of the major offshore
wind projects in Round 1 of Japan’s auctions for the sector, intense lobbying by competitors led to a change of
auction rules. One of the main actors in the lobbying was the Japan Wind Power Association (JWPA). Recently,

Mitsubishi has left the JWPA. Should the govt accept Mitsubishi’s proposals, it may weaken the negotiating
heft of the industry association.




Kobe Steel plans ammonia co-firing at four coal power stations
(Company statement, Oct 26)
•  Kobe Steel plans 20% ammonia co-firing by 2030 at the Kobe Unit 1 and Unit 2 coal power
stations, (each 700 MW capacity). At a later date, co-firing will start at Units 3 and 4, (each 650 MW

capacity).
•  By 2050, all four power stations will be running fully on ammonia.
•  The company plans to set up a supply chain for ammonia, which will be imported.
•  CONTEXT: Among the EPCOs, JERA, Kyushu Electric, Chugoku Electric, Shikoku Electric and
Tohoku Electric plan to introduce coal-ammonia co-firing. Among non-EPCOs, Tokuyama and
Tosoh will also use it.
• TAKEAWAY: The two 700 MW units will consume 700,000 tons/ year of ammonia at 20% co-firing. JERA and

Kyushu Electric plan 20% co-firing at 1 GW plants, consuming 1 million tons/ year of ammonia combined. If all
coal plants in the country did 20% ammonia co-firing, Japan would need 27 million tons/ year. In 2022, the
global ammonia market was 170 million tons in 2022, according to ChemAnalyst, which predicts that it will
almost double in the next 10 years or so.

Nikkei investigation: Nearly 90 solar panel incidents in 8 years due to stronger winds

(Nikkei, Oct 23)
•  CONTEXT: This data comes from a freedom of information request by the Nikkei, Japan’s biggest
business daily newspaper, to METI's regional offices, and also from interviews / surveys carried out
by the paper.
•  From 2015 to 2022, about 90 accidents nationwide were caused by or involved solar panels,
according to Nikkei’s research, but less than 10% of all incidents are reported.
•  The probe focused on damage caused to panels from strong winds that scatter and sometimes

even shatter the equipment. The reason for the incidents is said to be the fact that solar farms are
exempted from the Building Standards Act, which was done to accelerate the rollout of
renewables. The survey found cases of poor foundations for the panels and water drainage issues.
•  Until 2020, operators of facilities with a 50 kW capacity or less had no obligation to report
accidents. Even after the regulation was revised in 2021, there is no report requirement for
installations under 10 kW.
•  As a result, big insurers like Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire have started to vary their premiums based

on risk assessments of solar facilities by third-party organizations.

Iridium’s Challenge in the Age of Green Hydrogen

In June, Japan’s hydrogen strategy took a decisive green turn when METI rewrote the
2017 Basic Hydrogen Strategy in order to reflect the International Partnership for
Hydrogen and Fuel Cells that seeks to reduce hydrogen’s carbon footprint. METI’s
previous stance was that hydrogen of any color was useful in cutting emissions, but
now, it leans towards green hydrogen as the optimal solution.

The revised Basic Hydrogen Strategy also introduced a new target for green hydrogen
production: 15 GW of renewable-driven electrolyzer capacity by 2030. This is a major
leap from the present 14 MW. However, the 15 GW goal brings significant
challenges.

One of the most widespread electrolysis technologies globally is proton electrolysis
membrane (PEM), but one crucial item in this process is provided by the precious
metal iridium. Cost is not even the main issue. The most serious problem is iridium’s
severe scarcity amid rapidly growing global demand. In order to satisfy its appetite for
PEM systems, Japan alone will need one third of the current total global mined
iridium production.

Another problem is the significant carbon footprint of iridium mining, an inconvenient
fact that many would prefer to sweep under the rug. It’s estimated that there’s 3,289
tons CO2-equivalent emissions for one ton production of platinum group metals,
which includes iridium. Finding solutions to iridium supply and emissions will be
fundamental challenges in the growth of green hydrogen in Japan and globally.


Hydrogen investment boom
“Hey, are you investing in hydrogen? The government is giving away money.” These
words can now be heard often since the Green Transformation (GX) Act was passed in
May, allowing the government to issue ¥20 trillion GX bonds to finance the energy
transition, as well as to raise ¥150 trillion more through public and private efforts.


The immediate goal is to fund 15 GW in electrolysis capacity building by issuing GX
bonds. This capacity will produce 300,000 tons/ year of hydrogen from renewable
energy and water. That is 10% of METI’s goal for 3 million tons of hydrogen supply by
2030. ANRE began internal discussions on funding criteria, which will be finalized by
year’s end.

In Japan, the hydrogen production process using water electrolysis has been utilized
by the semiconductor industry for two decades or so. There are two technologies: the
proton exchange membrane (PEM), also known as polymer electrolyte membrane,
and alkaline water electrolysis (AWE).

In PEM systems, water particles pass through the membrane and separate into
hydrogen and oxygen after electricity is applied. Iridium is used on the cathode and
platinum on the anode. In AWE, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide solution is
used. The solution separates into hydrogen and oxygen after electricity is applied.

Steel is used as cathode and anode. PEM’s use of precious metals makes it expensive,
but it’s capable of accommodating volatile changes in the electricity volume. AWE is
cheaper to build but there are questions on how well it copes with sudden changes in
output from variable renewable power sources, and if sodium or potassium solution-
based systems could be managed easily.

Presently, AWE accounts for two thirds of Japan’s electrolysis capacity owing to a
single 10 MW capacity in Fukushima, which is the oldest green hydrogen system
operational since 2020. All other recent projects have PEM systems.

In the national hydrogen strategy, METI has positioned PEM and AWE as the main
technologies, setting 2030 cost targets: ¥65,000/ kW for PEM; and ¥52,000/ kW for
AWE. Japan NRG estimates the present cost to be around ¥500,000-550,000/ kW,
based on the amount of the government subsidy given to Hokkaido Electric for its 1
MW electrolyzer.

There are different views on which technology will capture a greater share by 2030.
The equipment manufacturers are expanding both PEM and AWE systems, assuming
each will have almost equal shares, but with 5-10% also going to novel technologies
through the end of the decade.

Supposing that PEM accounts for 40% of the 15 GW capacity to be added – Japan
will need to secure as much as 4.2 tons of iridium, over one third of the total globally-
mined production, which is between 7 to 8 tons annually. Japan’s electrolysis capacity
is seen to account for 10% of the global total.



Japan’s iridium demand in 2030
Data varies on how much iridium a PEM system requires. The World Platinum
Investment Council says 400 kg of iridium is required for 1 GW of electrolysis power.
Some experts said the iridium requirement could be as much as 700 kg/ GW. Also,
iridium electrodes do not last forever, and might end their life cycle after 10 years and
need to be replaced.

Based on the conservative estimate of 400 kg consumption for 1 GW, and applying
the present market rate of ¥22,900/ gram, the iridium materials cost for 1 kW comes

to ¥9,160. This is already 14% of the 2030 target cost of ¥65,000/ kW. The PEM
system will also require 0.3 grams of platinum per kW, which comes to ¥1,304.

Iridium is a platinum group metal (PGM), the crude ore of which typically contains
roughly 80% palladium and platinum. Iridium’s ratio might be only 1%. South African
mining companies Anglo American, Impala, Sibange Stillwater, and Northam account
for over 80% of global iridium production.

Source: Company press releases

To build reliable supply chains companies are joining forces. In October, Toshiba
Energy Systems and Solutions and Furuya Metal, a PGM trader and recycler, inked a
MoU to build an iridium supply chain. Furuya Metal is a Mitsubishi group company
with a top global share of ruthenium in terms of trading volume. It also runs a
recycling plant in Japan and is one of the few companies capable of recovering
iridium from industrial scrap.

Furuya can increase Toshiba’s supplies by improving the recovery rate of iridium from
wastes in the PEM system production. For its part, Toshiba claims to have developed
sputtering technologies that reduce iridium consumption by one tenth.


Recycling kills two birds with one stone
According to Heraerus, only 20-30% of end-of-life products that contain iridium are
recycled. However, if the recovery rate is raised to 80% then global supply can
increase by four tons or more.

Iridium recycling is very challenging technologically since only a few grams are used in

any one item and the process isn’t easy to scale. In Japan, studies reveal that spark
plugs with iridium are sold as ferrous scrap for less than ¥200/ kg since recyclers can’t
tell which plugs contain the precious metal.

Recycling also resolves iridium’s other problem: a high carbon footprint due to the
fact that its crude ore is smelted in temperatures of 1,500°C, and the work area needs
to be cooled. In 2022, Impala Platinum reported to the UK-based CDP, a climate
monitoring body for investors, that its Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 354,367 tons for
107.74 tons of PGM production, which comes to 3,289 tons CO2-e per ton of
production.

In comparison, hard-to-abate steel scored 1.41 tons CO2-e/ ton of steel, according to
the IEA. Heat treatment of recovered iridium occurs at lower temperatures of 1,000°C.
Canada’s iridium recycler, McCol Metal, estimates that recycling’s carbon footprint is
one third of mining. But 1,000 tons of CO2-e per ton of iridium recycled is still high.

Scientists are exploring chemical processes at lower temperatures, for example the
use of solid aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid) to separate
iridium at 500 °C. Another challenge is building an efficient process where different
end-of-life products could be treated at once. If successful, then recycling could
resolve both iridium supply and carbon intensity problems.

Recycling technology breakthroughs will not happen overnight. On the other hand,
cheaper electrolysis technology may emerge unexpectedly. Betting on a single
solution would be risky and it is important to keep eyes on other approaches, such as
the potential of other platinum group metals to act as iridium substitutes. Other
options include reducing iridium consumption, exploring untapped deposits in South
Africa, Canada and Australia, and reprocessing mine tailings that may still contain
some elements of iridium.

Effective and cost-efficient solutions will have to be found. Otherwise, there won’t be
much of a green hydrogen future in Japan, or elsewhere.

Japan’s Long Road to Nuclear Waste Disposal
The proper disposal of nuclear waste is a critical challenge for countries that rely
heavily on nuclear energy, such as Japan. Prime Minister Kishida's pledge to revitalize
the nation's slumbering nuclear industry, shuttered by the March 2011 Fukushima
disaster, underscores the necessity of finding a solution this decade.

More than 20 years ago, Japan began a structured approach toward the geological
disposal of nuclear waste and formed the Nuclear Waste Management Organization
(NUMO) to manage this issue. Since then, the government has struggled to convince
suitable municipalities to house the necessary infrastructure.


In recent months, there seemed to be positive momentum around locating a definitive
waste storage location. A debate on whether to potentially host such a facility has
unfolded on an islet in western Japan. The locality of Tsushima would have been the
third to raise its hand as a host candidate in the last three years. However, in the end,
turbulent local politics resulted in a stalemate.

Now, all hope rests with the remaining two candidate spots. Both are small
settlements in Hokkaido with more than a few challenges, the biggest of which is
legislation that effectively bans the movement of nuclear waste into the region.
Finding a way around this roadblock, or another town to volunteer as a host, is now
center stage in Japan’s nuclear industry.


Legislative and practical issues
After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, all of Japan’s 17 nuclear
power plants, with a total of 54 reactors, were shut down. At the moment, there are
24 reactors scheduled for decommissioning or in the process of being
decommissioned.

The Basic Energy Plan sets a target to secure 20% of Japan’s electricity supply from
nuclear power by FY2030. To maintain this 20% contribution from nuclear power by
2050, it’s estimated that 10 to 20 new reactors need to be built by mid-century.

In 2000, Japan enacted the Designated Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act and set
up NUMO to manage the geological disposal of both high-level radioactive waste
(HLW) and transuranic waste (TRU) generated from Japan's nuclear fuel cycle. This
waste results from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, wherein reusable uranium and
plutonium are separated, leaving HLW and TRU waste.

The HLW is vitrified and encased in stainless steel, preparing it for geological disposal.
This entails placing the waste in stable underground locations at least 300 meters
deep. The final disposal site surface will cover about 2 km², with underground facilities
storing over 40,000 glass pillars containing nuclear waste.



23

Source: NUMO

Wanted: Volunteer sites for nuclear waste disposal
There’s a three-stage investigation for selecting a final disposal site. The first stage,
termed "Literature survey," entails NUMO collecting region-specific geological data,
maps, and academic papers. Next, they assess the geological stability of potential
sites by checking for significant vulnerabilities such as volcanic or fault activities, or
weak geological layers that could hinder underground construction.

The second step is an "Overview survey" during which boring and other related tasks
are made at candidate sites. Finally, a "Detailed survey" is made, coinciding with
setting up an underground research laboratory at the planned sites. These three steps
can take as long as 20 years in total.

In 2002, NUMO began inviting Japanese municipalities to volunteer as locations to
host a nuclear waste storage site. In 2007, Toyo town (Kochi Pref), led by Mayor
Tashima Yasuoki, stepped forward. However, his decision was made without
consulting the Toyo assembly, which in the end stirred up significant local opposition.
The next election was won by a candidate opposing the storage plan, which led to the
withdrawal of Toyo's application.

Just putting up one’s hand can be a windfall for a locality because accepting a survey
comes with significant financial incentives. The first phase provides municipalities with
up to ¥2 billion, and no obligation to pay it back in the event of subsequent
withdrawal. The second phase can involve a total grant of up to ¥7 billion. Despite the
lucrative payout, about 15 years have passed without any other municipality stepping
forward as a candidate site.

Detailed survey Underground facilities construction To be About 14
determined  years


Final site selection process
To spur momentum into the search, in 2017 the central government produced the
Nationwide Map of Scientific Features, which delineates areas deemed scientifically
and geologically suitable for a final storage of nuclear waste.

Finally, as the impact of the Covid pandemic hit local economies, two municipalities in
Hokkaido suddenly stepped forward. In late 2020, survey work began in the town of
Suttsu and the village of Kamoenai that applied for a "Literature survey." Suttsu, with
a population of 2,838, and Kamoenai with about 870 residents, resemble many other
peripheral Japanese towns with dwindling populations and industries in need of
financial resources.


Following METI’s approval of the two towns' applications, NUMO began surveys in
both locations on November 17.

suitable ground. Suttsu looks more promising. Still, as far as NUMO is concerned,
both locations were within areas deemed as potentially suitable based on the 2017
Nationwide Map of Scientific Features. That’s why the agency says it went ahead with
the surveys.


Recent developments
Despite NUMO hosting explanatory meetings and a publicity campaign targeting
about 160 locations nationwide, the only concrete interest so far has been limited to
the two places in Hokkaido. This led to a revision of the Designated Radioactive
Waste Final Disposal Act in April 2023, aiming to enhance information-sharing and
discussions among the government, NUMO, power utilities, and local municipalities.
Starting July, a team of representatives from government and power companies
began a nationwide tour in order to expand the regions where the literature review
could be conducted.

The group seemed to sway the mood in Tsushima (Nagasaki Pref), a small islet north
of Kyushu. The Tsushima City council discussed acceptance of the literature survey,
with a pro-acceptance group submitting a petition. After an initial rejection, on
September 12 the petition was adopted with a majority of 10 to 8 in favor. However,
the final decision on whether to welcome the survey rested with the mayor.

On September 27, the mayor decided not to accept the preliminary survey, citing
several reasons such as insufficient local support, concerns about reputational damage
to tourism and the fisheries industry, and the inability to eliminate risks from
unforeseen factors. NUMO responded to Japan NRG to say that it takes the mayor's
decision seriously, and that nothing has been decided at the current time.

Things seem to be progressing in Hokkaido, however. Initially slated for a two-year
duration, the literature surveys in Suttsu and Kamoenai were extended by about a
year. What’s more, the local political support seems to remain in place, at least for
now.


On October 3, an election was held for the Suttsu town council. Five candidates
supporting the survey were elected, ensuring a majority. The town also elected four
council members that oppose the survey. Although not directly involved in the survey
process, the council, alongside the mayor, will likely have a big influence on how the
town’s residents feel about moving to the second stage of the survey process.


What’s next?
Suttsu’s Mayor Kataoka plans a referendum on whether to proceed with the
second "overview survey" stage of the process. But even if the residents approve, the
town will also need to battle with the Hokkaido governor.

While not required for the first stage, the governor's approval is necessary to proceed
to the second, and Hokkaido Governor Suzuki Naomichi is not a supporter. Suzuki can
defend his position by pointing to a Hokkaido Prefectural ordinance that strongly
advises that no nuclear waste should be brought into the region.

Interestingly, Hokkaido is the only prefecture with a clear anti-nuclear waste stance. Its
ordinance doesn't prevent municipalities from conducting surveys, but it hints at
potential roadblocks that will impede waste importation.

Of course, ordinances and laws can be rewritten if there’s enough reason to do so. If
research confirms the sites as suitable locations, then the national government can
work on persuading the Hokkaido governor to lessen the prefecture’s opposition.

When the survey began three years ago, both Mayor Kataoka and then-Minister of
Industry Kajiyama Hiroshi backed it, saying that the initial phase did not automatically
lead to the second stage, and that the literature survey did not contradict the
ordinance. This appeared to sidestep the issue and postpone the problems, playing
for time.

The stalling tactics could easily backfire. As local mayors wrestle with the dilemma of
winning lucrative grants against likely anger from local fisheries and the tourism
industry, the chances of a town performing a U-turn on its candidacy are not small.
And the further the survey process extends, the more time will be “wasted” if at some
point during the 20-year review period the local leadership withdraws its candidacy.
Such a turnaround could easily be sparked by personal conflicts or local politics.

The government’s softly-softly approach looks good enough to reach ‘first base’. But
to score a ‘home run’ and secure a viable long-term solution, officials may have to
alter their tactics.

GLOBAL       VIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the
Japan NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We
see the following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

AI/Energy demand
According to Schneider Electric, (with the exception of China) AI consumes about 85-
134 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across the globe each year, which is about as
much as the Netherlands’ energy consumption. This figure could grow five-fold by
2028.

China/Renewable energy
China’s renewable energy expansion can’t keep pace with demand even though the
country added 226 GW of generating capacity in 2023 – solar (129 GW); thermal (39
GW); wind (33 GW); and hydro (8 GW). Thermal plants are generating far more hours
on average (3,344 hours) than hydro (2,367 hours), wind (1,665) and solar (1,017
hours), according to the National Energy Administration.

France/Hydrogen power
Air Liquide, one of the world’s largest hydrogen producers, plans to invest €3.4 billion
over the next 12 months, with half going to projects in the U.S. where it plans to
become a leader.

Italy/CCS
Gas grid Snam and Eni plan to capture CO2 and store it in depleted gas fields,
betting that French companies, such as cement and steel makers, will store their CO2
in the Italian hub instead of Norway’s CCS facilities. The first phase launches by early
2025 to store 25,000 tons of CO2 a year in depleted gas fields offshore Ravenna.

Qatar/Natural gas
QatarEnergy inked a deal to sell 1 mtpa of LNG supply to Italy’s Eni for 27 years
starting 2026. The volumes will be sourced from expansion of the North Field East
(NFE), one of the world's largest gas fields, which will increase LNG production from
77 mtpa to 110 mtpa. With the North Field South (NFS) phase, Qatar plans a capacity
of 126 mtpa by 2027.

Russia/Natural gas
Gazprom will supply extra gas to Hungary this winter, and will provide China with an
additional 600 million cubic meters this year on top of contractual obligations.
President Putin met the leaders of both countries during a trip to China last week.

Offshore Wind
General Electric expects its offshore-wind operations to post annual losses of about $1
billion for this year and in 2024 as the industry struggles with rising costs. Next year,
the company expects offshore will have similar losses but “substantially improved cash
performance.”

Singapore/Natural gas
Singapore will set up a single buyer of natural gas for its power-generation sector to
improve energy security. This entity will aggregate gas demand from the power-
generation companies (gencos), then import the gas required, and sell it to the
gencos.

Sweden/EV batteries
Northvolt, Europe’s largest battery maker, could go public next year, but the plans are
still preliminary. The Swedish battery maker has invited investment banks to pitch for
roles in the deal that could value the company at about $20 billion.

Venezuela/Oil
A U.S. judge will hold an auction of Houston-based Citgo, which is owned by
Venezuela. For the past four years, the U.S. protected oil refiner Citgo Petroleum from
creditors seeking to seize Venezuela's foreign crown jewel for billions of dollars in
claims.

U.S./Oil
Chevron will buy rival Hess for $53 billion; the deal reflects energy companies' bid for
oil and gas assets. The deal intensifies competition between Chevron and Exxon, but
they’ll now be partners in Guyana's booming oil fields expected to produce 1.2 mbpd
by 2027.
