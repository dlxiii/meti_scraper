GX Decarbonization Power Supply Act passed by Diet’s upper house
(Japan NRG, May 31)
•  The Diet’s House of Councillors (upper house) approved the GX Decarbonization Power Supply
Act. It concerns a range of issues, including the nuclear power sector and renewable energy.
•  According to the Act, the Nuclear Regulation Authority will write the rules related to power plant
inspections, extending the operating life, etc. The NRA will have no role in deciding reactor

lifespan. METI is the sole authority to decide that issue.
•  NRA Chairman Yamanaka said there’ll be no change in review principles due to the Act, but there’ll
be new processes such as filing long-term facility management plans for 30–50-year-old plants.
The NRA will need to speed up reviews.
•  The law also clarified reactor decommissioning rules.
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies welcomed the law as it is also expected to drive the
spread of renewables via power transmission network building, financing and community relations.

• TAKEAWAY: The law confirms that METI will be the main authority on overall reactor lifespan decisions, but
also confirms that the NRA can request inspections of the facilities every 10 years after 30 years of operation.
This makes the METI license terms subject to NRA approval since the regulator has sole authority over nuclear
safety. This is a nuance that could develop into a bigger issue as any outside funding for reactor development,
for example from banks, will question whether the guaranteed license term for a new nuclear facility is 30 or 40
years. For further details, see this week’s Analysis section.



Govt to establish expert group to decide mechanism for new electricity settlement platform

(Denki Shimbun, May 31)
•  METI and ANRE plan to establish an expert group to work on a new power market that would
allow the simultaneous settlement of kilowatt-hours (electricity volume on the spot market) and
delta kilowatts (balancing power on the supply-demand adjustment market). The idea is to allow
trading of the two on a day-ahead basis. In other words, a day before actual supply and demand.
•  The goal, as proposed at the Comprehensive Resource Energy Study Committee, is to prevent
potential over-trading and unnecessary startup of thermal power that would increase costs and
CO2 emissions due to the simultaneous but separate operation of the spot market and the supply-

demand adjustment market.
•  The new market, expected to prevent price surges and alleviate power supply-demand
imbalances, will be designed to start necessary power generation across Japan and rationally
distribute delta kilowatts and kilowatt-hours.
•  The feasibility of the new market will be evaluated through simulations and cost-benefit analyses in
collaboration with transmission and distribution operators (T&D) and the Japan Wholesale Power
Exchange (JEPX).

Measures to reduce renewable energy output curtailment to be compiled by year’s end
(Denki Shimbun, May 30)
•  METI and ANRE plan measures by year’s end to reduce output curtailment of renewable energy.
They also seek a plan to reduce the minimum output of new thermal power generation facilities

from the current 50% to 30% by FY2024.
•  ANRE reported that the amount of output curtailment, which was about 100 GWh in FY2018,
increased to about 600 GWh in FY2022 due to the reduction in power demand resulting from
energy saving and conservation in the wake of rising electricity prices.
•  The agency emphasized the need for drastic efforts to expand renewable energy capacity, such as
using storage batteries and power control devices.
•  The meeting also discussed how to connect and use system storage batteries, examining

mechanisms to encourage charging at times when output curtailment occurs, and explore the
expansion of transmission line operating capacity using storage batteries. They also noted the
need to consider national rules since requests for connection of system storage batteries are
rapidly increasing nationwide.


JOGMEC  to rewrite resource diplomacy strategy to integrate net zero projects

(Japan NRG, May 29)
•  JOGMEC will rewrite the resource diplomacy strategy to integrate net zero projects and goals for
ammonia, hydrogen, biofuel and other carbon neutral energy sources, and to reflect changes in
geopolitical and market realities.
•  Rather than building a resource-specific strategy, the integrated strategies cover multi-sectors, and
interests will be developed for a single country.
•  24 countries were selected for the primary analysis and categorized into five groups based on

resource potential, economic efficiency and infrastructure, export capacity and stability, and
approach to net zero and relations with Japan.
•  JOGMEC will complete the country analysis that includes potential, Japan’s possible approaches,
and risks.

•  CONTEXT: JOGMEC will implement programs to strengthen data gathering and sharing with
private and state sectors. It will discuss Japan’s resource strategy with partner countries.
• TAKEAWAY: This ambitious approach will require major reforms within JOGMEC, which has historically had
strong silos. For example, staff in its gas unit, one of the biggest, hardly spoke with those involved in rare
metals.



MoE tightens criteria for offshore wind, will coordinate with METI and MLIT

(Government statement, June 1)
•  The MoE proposed conducting environmental impact surveys of wind projects and considering
results in the selection process for Offshore Wind Promotion Zones.
•  If major impacts can’t be avoided, the MoE will seek changes in wind turbine installation plans,
including a decrease in the number of turbines.
•  The MoE will coordinate with METI and MLIT, which have the authority to designate the Offshore
Wind Promotion Zones.



Toshiba, Toray, and Panasonic develop tech to lower costs of green hydrogen
(Nikkei Asia, June 2)
•  Green hydrogen is often produced using polymer electrolyte membranes (PEM) that require
electrodes containing iridium. Toshiba developed a way to reduce iridium content by 90% while
maintaining output and durability. Since iridium’s price is 2.5 times more than gold due to high

demand for green hydrogen, Toshiba’s tech should help to cut costs.
•  Toray makes an electrolyte membrane for PEM electrolyzers that uses hydrocarbons instead of
fluoride and is four times stronger. It improves efficiency and lowers costs.
•  Panasonic enhanced alkaline electrolyzers without the need for expensive metals, and hydrogen
production efficiency was achieved by reducing the size of nickel and iron to nanometers to make
a catalyst
• TAKEAWAY: Japan seeks to reduce the cost of hydrogen from ¥100/m3 today to ¥20/m3 by 2050. These new

technologies mentioned above will reduce costs, but still aren’t enough to achieve targets. The hope is that
more companies will strive to develop new technologies in the coming years, which will increase overall
hydrogen demand.



Major trading houses plan multi-trillion-yen investments in green energy
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, May 30)
•  Trading companies, including Marubeni and Mitsui, are ramping up investments in sustainable
energy. Marubeni, for example, plans to allocate about ¥1.73 trillion to develop offshore wind in
the UK.
•  Mitsui wants to increase the proportion of renewable energy in its power generation business, from

14% to over 30% by 2030. Sumitomo is considering a ¥692 billion investment to expand offshore
wind in the UK.
•  Mitsui's medium-term strategy calls for energy transition investment of roughly ¥1 trillion, with a
specific focus on next-gen fuels and the establishment of value chains.

Tokyo govt, Sekisui Chemical plan PSC solar system tests in closed space
(Japan NRG, May 29)
•  The Tokyo govt and Sekisui Chemical launched a pilot solar power project installing nine
perovskite solar cell (PSC) panels on top of a facility at the Morigasaki water reclamation center. A

govt official told Japan NRG that it’s considering testing PSCs installed in closed spaces.
•  They also plan to test panels installed at various angles in open spaces. Testing, however, hasn’t
been finalized.
•  The nine panels, provided by Sekisui, have a combined capacity of 1 kW and occupy a total space
of 4.1 x 3.6 meters. The panels are 1-mm thick. This PSC pilot is the largest in Japan, and the trial
runs until Dec 1, 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: This may be the country’s first pilot PSC in a closed space. Other companies developing PSC

include Toshiba Energy Systems, Kaneka, Panasonic, Aisin, Mitsubishi Chemicals, and Enecoat Technologies.
Municipal govts are keen to collaborate as they need to set zero-carbon plans and attract new industries.
Toshiba Energy Systems launched Japan’s first PSC outdoor test in Yokohama in February.
•  PSC hopes to be the next-gen solar power system; it’s made of perovskite-crystal materials that are

lighter, thinner and more flexible compared to silicon-based panels. Many govts plan to rebuild
their solar system supply chains to be more self-sufficient and are expected to take action to foster
these technologies.

Kashiwazaki nuclear reactors.
•  Local leaders are sceptical over Tokyo Electric’s (TEPCO) ability to run the reactors after multiple
fire, security and data breach incidents. “It is not an easy decision. If TEPCO loses the Kashiwazaki

reactors, the company won’t be financially sustainable…I’m asking what could be possible
alternatives to TEPCO,” said the Kashiwazaki City mayor.
•  CONTEXT: Kashiwazaki was at one point considered to be the world’s largest nuclear-power
generating plant. It was idled after a July 2007 earthquake, which did not cause major damage but
did exceed its design basis. Concerns about the level of tremors the plant can withstand led to
major upgrade works at the site that took several years and part of it was still not restarted in 2011
when the Fukushima disaster hit. Since then, the plant’s operator has struggled to convince the

EPCO shareholders file resolutions for stronger compliance
(Japan NRG, May 30)
•  Shareholders of Chubu Electric and Kyushu Electric filed resolutions to strengthen compliance

following cartel charges in March by the Japan Fair Trade Commission.
•  74 Chubu Electric shareholders demanded to set up a compliance committee, and one
shareholder at Kyushu Electric filed a resolution saying that company executives should face pay
cuts for allowing the cartel. The companies oppose the resolutions saying effective compliance
systems already exist.
•  An unnamed shareholder, (or shareholders), of four power companies (EPCOs) will demand
auditors to claim damages from the executives who failed to stop the cartel. The EPCOs involved

are Kansai Electric (KEPCO), Chubu Electric, Kyushu Electric and Chugoku Electric, according to
Nikkei.
•  The shareholder(s) will send a letter on June 7. Under the Companies Act, shareholders can file suit
after 60 days if companies fail to act.
•  CONTEXT: On March 30, the JFTC imposed a total of ¥101 billion in penalties on Chugoku
Electric, Chubu Electric, Chubu Electric Miraiz, Kyushu Electric and Kyuden Mirai Energy for cartel
conduct. Chugoku Electric, Chubu Electric and its subsidiary Chubu Electric Miraiz challenged the

JFTC decision. KEPCO was granted leniency for cooperating with authorities.

Shareholder resolutions related to cartel Potential shareholder suit
Acknowledges cartel but no charges
Kepco       none
due to leniency
Chubu Electric Set up compliance committee Challenges cartel allegation
Chugoku Electric none                Challenges cartel allegation
Kyushu Electric Executive pay cuts   Acknowledges non-compliance


• TAKEAWAY: Shareholder lawsuits on anti-trust violations are quite rare in Japan. The methodology that the
plaintiff will try to employ to calculate the KEPCO damage will be interesting since the company wasn’t hit with
penalties and their amount is the base for calculating compensation.



JWPA published publishes roadmap for wind power sector until 2050
(Company statement, May 29)
•  The Japan Wind Power Association (JWPA) released “Wind Vision 2023” in light of the govt’s plans
to go carbon neutral by 2050 via the Green Transformation (GX) strategy.
•  The Vision sets the goal to source 33%, or 140 GW, of Japan’s energy demand from wind power

by 2050; 40 GW from onshore and 100 GW from offshore (40 GW from fixed-bottom and 60 GW
from floating).

• TAKEAWAY: In 2019, METI and the JWPA released a plan to adopt 36 GW of both onshore and offshore wind
power by 2030, 66 GW by 2040, and 75 GW by 2050. In Dec 2020, METI revised the offshore wind target to
10 GW by 2030 and 30-45 GW by 2040. As of Dec 2022, installed wind power capacity was 4.7 GW for
onshore and 0.1 GW for offshore. Capacity has been growing every year, but reaching 140 GW by 2050
requires 5 GW of installations per year for the next 27 years. Although Wind Vision 2023 is not an official govt

plan, the association does coordinate closely with the authorities and pushes officials to aim higher. The latest
plan shows just how much will need to change in this sector for the govt to meet its GX goals.



J-Power develops 20 kW floating wind turbines that lower costs
(Company statement, May 30)
•  J-Power, TEPCO, Chubu Electric, K LINE, and Albatross Technology plan to build a small-scale,
next-gen floating axis wind turbine (FAWT) demo project.
•  The FAWT concept is studied by J-Power, Osaka Univ Graduate School of Engineering, and
Albatross. Small-scale experimental versions of the FAWT will be installed, and then after validation

of analysis and design, the group plans to move on to building MW-class offshore demo projects.
•  Fukui Fibertech (Aichi Pref) and Mirai Ships (Miyagi Pref) will help develop the wind turbine and the
floating section, respectively. Kanazawa Institute of Technology will develop carbon composite
molding technology and do motion analysis.
• TAKEAWAY: METI plans to increase offshore wind power generation capacity to 30-45 GW by 2040. The
government has asked industry to source at least 60% of the components for wind systems domestically by
2040. Yet, very few wind turbines for onshore or offshore are made by Japanese companies. Nearly all sales in

Japan are by overseas turbine manufacturers such as GE, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa, which primarily use
supply chains in Europe and elsewhere. This project promises to be a “game changer” for Japanese
manufacturers interested in the wind sector, but it is still at an early stage.

The company aims to start operation in 2029.



Kansai curtailed solar and wind power output for the first time
(Nikkei, June 3)
•  Kansai Electric Power Transmission and Distribution Co., a subsidiary of Kansai Electric (KEPCO),
suspended some solar and wind power generation on June 4 (Sunday), from 9:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
This is the first such curtailment in the Kansai area.
•  Due to the holidays, factory operations decreased and demand for electricity dropped, but the

output of solar power generation increased due to good weather. The affected capacity was
estimated to be around 420 MW to 520 MW.
•  CONTEXT: Curtailment issues are on the rise nationwide. In April, there was a curtailment in the
Chubu area for the first time.
• TAKEAWAY: Renewable energy power generation is growing in the Kansai area. At the end of April, the
region's solar and wind power generation capacity was 7.18 million kW, a 43% increase compared to the end

of October 2018. To further expand renewable energy power generation, it's necessary to develop power
transmission and distribution networks, as well as power storage facilities.

MoE won’t rule out decommissioning Konan GTCC gas-fired power plant
(Government statement, June 1)
•  MoE said Kansai Electric’s (KEPCO) plan to upgrade the LNG-fired Konan power plants to GTCC
(gas turbine combined cycle) plants with less carbon emissions may need to be scrapped if it is

incompatible with the national net zero goal. The Konan plants have three power generators with a
total 1.8 GW capacity.
•  GTCC is possibly the best available gas-based technology but more ambitious efforts are required,
including shifts to decarbonized fuel and CCUS, and environmental sustainability throughout the
fuel supply chain, the ministry said.
•  CONTEXT: METI will make a final decision, factoring in the MoE’s conclusion.
• TAKEAWAY: The MoE’s push for a faster departure from fossil fuels will propel more companies to work with

ammonia, hydrogen and CCUS. This week, Mitsui Chemical and Osaka Gas agreed to study deploying CCUS
at the Semboku Industrial Zone by 2030.


Itochu and Kaneka to cooperate in storage, solar PPAs and regional microgrid

Nissan reportedly developing cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate battery
(Asahi Shimbun, May 31)
•  Nissan Motor is developing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that don’t contain any cobalt, in

order to cut down EV battery costs, possibly by 30%.
•  The LFP cells have lower performance compared to nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) lithium-ion
cells that are mainstream EV batteries, but their quality has improved thanks to Chinese producers.
• TAKEAWAY: Nissan has been pursuing cobalt-free batteries for almost two decades. It partnered with NEC
Tokin, which has track records in development of cobalt substitutes, to form a battery joint venture,
Automotive Energy Supply Corp (AESC). Nissan, however, sold AESC to China’s Envision group in 2018.



Tokyo Gas to invest ¥30 billion in synthetic methane and hydrogen R&D

(Jiji, June 1)
•  Shinichi Sasayama, President of Tokyo Gas, said the company will invest ¥30 billion over the next
three years into R&D into synthetic methane and hydrogen.
•  CONTEXT: Synthetic methane emits CO2 during combustion, but if it is produced by capturing
carbon dioxide emitted from factories, its emissions are not considered as additional. Tokyo Gas,
Mitsubishi Corporation, Osaka Gas and others, are currently working on a synthetic methane
production project in the US.
•  Sasayama said that if hydrogen can be procured cheaply using existing infrastructure such as LNG

terminals, there is a strong possibility that synthetic methane can be manufactured at an
economically viable cost.

ANALYSIS

Former Head of the Power Regulator Says:
Reforming the Industry Is a Must

The power sector requires trillions of yen in investment to upgrade to a net-zero
economy. But there’s growing concern about the sector’s ability to raise the funds or
carry out the long-term investment programs required for decarbonization. In addition
to seeing their profits squeezed by high fuel prices and a weak yen, Japan’s major
power utilities have been rocked by numerous scandals. None are bigger than the
claim that the companies, which used to operate as regional power monopolies, failed
to adapt to the new competitive landscape. State probes found that several of the
utilities, known also as EPCOs, illicitly passed on competitor data to their retail units.
Now, the companies face a record \101 billion in antitrust penalties.
The problems don’t seem to be limited to a few poor individual decisions. Criticism
has swirled also about the role of the regulator and govt officials. In an effort to
appease the public, in April, the METI Minister Nishimura vowed to make
amendments to the Electricity Business Act that will strictly penalize wrongdoing. But
many industry players say that this is not enough. While stricter laws should help, their
impact will mean little without stricter enforcement.

The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) was created to oversee
the newly liberalized utility markets. The power sector was fully opened to new players
in 2016, with the gas sector following in 2017. The EGC, however, is what is known as
a “soft regulator”. It can issue advisories but not orders. It cannot impose fines. Such
powers are reserved for ANRE and METI. So, is it time for Japan to rethink the role of
the regulator?
Japan NRG interviewed Hatta Tatsuo, the very first chair of the EGC, who served in
the role from 2015 to 2021. Hatta is a former professor of economics at Osaka
University and presently a member of the Cabinet Taskforce to Review Renewables
Regulations. He is also chair of the state-run Asian Growth Research Institute.


Basic reforms: amending the Electricity Business Act

Q: How should the Electricity Business Act change to make power sector regulation
more effective?
A: The Electricity Business Act is a weak law. This needs to change more than anything
else. The law’s major flaws are: 1) It is not aimed at promoting competition, and 2)
there is no penalty for anticompetitive behavior. It needs to be revamped into a law
the clear purpose of which is to promote fair competition. The law would be more
effectively implemented if the regulator could administer penalties.
Currently, the law talks about the need for electricity to be sold in an “appropriate
manner”. It’s unclear what that means. But is there anything more inappropriate than
a transmission network passing on customer data of competitors to their [related]
power retail division? This offense should be enough for a company to lose its
operating license.
When ANRE was planning the liberalization of the power industry, EPCOs told the
agency: please leave competition issues to us, we will ensure competition on a
voluntary basis. We recently learned this was not the case at all.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

| Former Head of the Power Regulator Says: |
| --- |
| Reforming the Industry Is a Must |

Q: What are some rules that need to be clarified within the law?

A: The law needs to say clearly that it seeks to promotes fair competition. The law
needs to restrict information and personnel exchanges between various EPCO units
and ensures non-discriminatory power sales to parties in and outside of the [EPCO]
business group. I would also add a new requirement for EPCOs to set up an
independent compliance panel. Following the case of Kansai Electric (KEPCO)
executives receiving gifts from the Takahama town mayor, KEPCO created a
compliance panel comprised of outside lawyers. It now appears that the panel was
instrumental to instilling change. In fact, it is the outside lawyers who may have
influenced KEPCO management to report their cartel behavior to the Japan Fair
Trade Commission (JFTC) and in return to seek leniency.
Q: The JFTC has been offering advice to small businesses about their rights in this
case. Have whistleblowers come forward?

A: JFTC action tends to be whistleblower-driven. The Commission’s powers are
backed by its ability to hand out heavy penalties. The Securities and Exchange Market
Surveillance Commission is another government agency that the power to punish,
thus people fear them. In the case of EGC, yes, businesses have reached to them for
advice, but there are no whistleblowers. Because in the present system, offenders are
not punished.

Financial independence paves way to a strong regulator

Q: How can EGC become more authoritative?

A: The regulator needs experts such as lawyers, electric engineers, accountants and IT
engineers. Let me give you an example. In 2016, the EGC found that Tokyo Electric
(TEPCO) Energy Partners was selling in the spot market at levels above their marginal
cost, which pushed up spot prices. It was an IT programmer who spotted it. He was
analyzing exchange data and started to dig deeper. A case was established and the
EGC contacted the company president.
The market is evolving. Day ahead market trade volumes are rising. Regulators need
to have the skills to detect non-compliance. METI officials often do not have this skill
set. The EGC needs to hire outside talent and offer them competitive compensation.
But is it possible for the EGC to increase staff while reducing its headcount seconded
from METI or MoE? There is a cap on the number of government employees [the
regulator can employ] and this is written in law. So, the EGC can become financially
independent. In the U.S., the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and, in
the UK, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) are run by license fees
charged to operators. The Japan Patent Office also has a similar scheme. The EGC
can introduce such a system.
Q: A former EGC official said the regulator’s limited career path dampened
motivation.

A: The EGC can create an affiliate organization that conducts research, plans
programs and designs market mechanisms. The affiliate body will recruit people from
power operators. If the EGC had its own budget, it could become an “Article 3
commission” like the JFTC. (Presently the EGC is an “Article 8 commission” with
limited enforcement capacities.) This would help promote new career paths and
opportunities. At an Article 3 commission, there are director-general positions and
opportunities to climb to a vice-minister rank. Ultimately, the regulator’s experience

20

and knowledge base won’t grow unless people stay. In the long term, as the EGC
acquires a track record, it could take over some ANRE duties.


Independence from politics
Q: Does the EGC also needs to be more independent and neutral?

A: Independent from what? That is the question. The EGC needs to be independent
from the subjects it regulates. Like the ANRE is. But the EGC is not independent from
govt policymakers. METI officials told parliament that ANRE’s energy policies take
priority over the EGC functions.

The EGC needs to stay independent from politics. Presently our electricity bills include
surcharges that go towards nuclear power and renewables operators. In order to be
independent from nuclear and renewables policies, the present mechanism to pool
funds from electricity charges needs to stop. Any policy related programs should be
financed by tax, not electricity fees or surcharges. Revenues from power services
should be spent on those services. Separating policy-related items from the electricity
bills will allow the regulator to focus on market efficiency and not be distracted by
policy and budget issues.
The regulator should pursue market efficiency, think about avoiding losses, and
promote fair practices. They’ll be able to do it if they are the best specialized
professionals, who know what works.

Nuclear Restarts: What Happens When an Immovable Regulator
Meets an Unstoppable Energy Policy?


Almost a year ago, Prime Minister Kishida promised to have up to 17 nuclear reactors
operating at the start of the summer of 2023. The premier’s comments raised much
excitement/concern (depending on one’s stance on nuclear power), but all agreed this
was a significant acceleration of the restart program. After all, 17 units is just over half
of Japan’s total.

It is now the start of the summer, 2023. There are nine reactors online. That number
has yet to actually hit double-figures since the nation’s nuclear plants were idled after
the 2011 Fukushima accident. And, the two more Kansai Electric units that were
certain to swirl into action this and next month are now back “under review” by the
regulator with no restart date announced.

The situation is probably best described as what happens when the seemingly
unstoppable force of energy policy, driven by record fuel and electricity prices, meets
the immovable object of industry regulation. In the 10 years since its inception,
Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) has become one of the most powerful
state entities, skillfully rebuffing nearly all attempts by industry and government to
wrest control.
Perhaps unintentionally, the NRA now challenges the ability of bureaucrats and
politicians to fully determine national energy policy. As a new debate heats up in
Japan over policing of the broader electricity sector (see the first article in this week’s
Analysis section), the NRA could serve as a useful case study. After a series of recent
scandals involving major utilities, the power industry is ripe for stronger regulation.
But, will the government accept less policy control?


Background
In 2022, on the back of record fuel and electricity prices, Kishida became the first
Japanese PM in over a decade to announce unequivocal support for a revival of the
domestic nuclear power industry. The PM said he wanted nine reactors online in the
winter of 2022/23, and as many as 17 by the summer of 2023.

With Kishida’s backing, METI quickly rolled out a long-term roadmap for the nuclear
sector that outlined a strategy to support the R&D of four additional reactor
technologies in addition to those already deployed in Japan. The ministry’s plan
called for new reactors to replace aging units at existing nuclear station sites, with an
eye for further developments at an undefined point in the future.

In the last decade, the main stumbling block to a more positive nuclear energy
strategy in Japan has been public opposition. However, in 2022, due to a jump in
energy costs and concern about future resource supply from Russia, public opinion
turned favorable towards nuclear power.



22


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The government set course to accelerate the sector’s revival. Yet the regulator has
shown up those plans.


The making of the NRA
Prior to the 2011 nuclear accident, both promotion and regulation of the nuclear
industry was spearheaded by METI. Ostensibly, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency (NISA) policed the nuclear operators, but it was simply a branch of METI. In
2012, NISA was disbanded and a new entity took its place.

The NRA was created as an Article 3 commission organization with the sole right to
exercise authority over nuclear safety. Nominally, it was part of the Ministry of
Environment (MoE), but it has grown as a fiercely independent entity with the
resources to hold its own in the world of politics and policy. The NRA was reported as
employing over 1,100 staff last year, almost a third of the personnel at the entire MoE.

From its inception, the NRA was determined to be viewed as independent and
transparent. It avoided all “on-background” briefings with industry people, kept its
correspondences strictly official, and streamed its main deliberations and meetings on
YouTube.

The regulator has not shied away from publicly shaming nuclear operators for
mistakes in their documentation, from challenging the validity of geological data to
pointing out typographical errors. The NRA has recently cast doubt over the future of
several major facilities that METI officials and the ruling party lawmakers deem vital to
Japan’s energy security.

•  Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant (NPP): The regulator said in May
2023 that an on-site inspection revealed that the owner, TEPCO, had yet to
resolve safety issues in four out of 27 areas; the NRA has also attacked the
overall safety culture at the facility after a string of minor security incidents
•  Tsuruga NPP: Plant operator Japan Atomic Power Co. was asked in April
2023 to revise its restart application after finding a large number of errors,
both factual and typographical, in the document; the operator was already
questioned by the NRA several times about the validity of its data, which is
likely to translate into problems securing a green light from the local
government for the restart
•  Takahama NPP: Kansai Electric said on May 2 that the planned restart of Unit
1 on June 3 after 12 years, and the same for Unit 2 on July 15, will now be
delayed until the NRA completes its review of amendments to the design and
construction of a new fire prevention system at the facilities


Who’s really in charge?
The NRA is led by five commissioners. Their terms are intentionally staggered so that
they cannot be replaced at once at the whim of lawmakers and the NRA puts forward
its own candidates, according to Florentine Koppenborg, Chair of Environmental and
Climate Policy at the Technical University of Munich and author of “Japan's nuclear
disaster and the politics of safety governance”, which is due to be published later this
month.

Koppenborg has spent years researching the NRA and concluded that the state entity
has resisted capture by the industry, thus fundamentally altering the environment for
nuclear policy implementation in Japan away from a top-down dictate. In the process,
the NRA has opened up the industry to additional scrutiny from the public and wider
legal action, raising the cost of nuclear generation while taking authority away from
the government to control the sector’s development.

For example, this year TEPCO filed an application to METI asking for an increase in its
power tariff to reflect the rising cost of purchasing natural gas and coal to fuel its
thermal stations. The utility lowered the rate increase that it sought based on the
understanding that it could restart at least one unit at its only operable nuclear power
plant, Kashiwazaki Kariwa, in October 2023. However, while METI approved the tariff
increase, the regulator did not concur that TEPCO’s NPP was fit to restart.

NRA Chair Yamanaka Shinsuke said in May that it was “up to TEPCO” in terms of how
long the regulators will continue to inspect the Kashiwazaki Kariwa site.

De jure, Japan has an administrative act that limits to two years the time that a state
entity has to respond. De facto, no company or government official can instruct the
NRA on how and when to conduct its work, or challenge the regulator’s way of doing
things.

Next month will be the 10-year anniversary since the NRA started to review the restart
application of the three reactors at the Tomari NPP (Hokkaido Electric).


Conclusion
When asked to assess whether the nuclear industry revival promised by PM Kishida is
real, an energy expert that sits on numerous METI committees and panels frowns.

Building new reactors is a huge up-front investment commitment, which requires
good visibility on future demand and operational conditions. A regulator that avoids
working with the industry to problem-solve makes that visibility very uncertain, the
expert says. After all, even if the government promises industry players certain
conditions, such as an operating license valid for a specific number of years, the NRA
can unveil rules that effectively impose a different scenario. Private business simply
can’t take on such risks, the expert concludes.

Even if Japan’s reactor builders prepare new designs, domestic utilities may hesitate
to continue their involvement in the nuclear business, according to Koppenborg. But
such an exit would open a Pandora’s box worth of challenges for the government, not
the least of which is what would then happen to used nuclear fuel and processed
plutonium.

Japan needs a state-owned nuclear company to take the industry forward, says one
industry expert. Waiting on the revival of TEPCO as a nuclear operator has been a
mistake. METI must resolve TEPCO’s future before the government can make realistic
promises for the sector.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Solar power
The defunct firm Sun Cable was rescued by part owner and tech entrepreneur Mike
Cannon-Brookes via his Grok Ventures, bidding less than A$100 million. The prize is
the firm’s permit to build 20 GW in solar capacity with up to 42 GW hours of battery
storage in the Northern Territory.

Belgium/ Synthetic fuel
TotalEnergies and a Belgian energy start-up Tree Energy Solutions plan to build a $2
billion plant in the U.S. to produce synthetic natural gas. The plant, which will
probably be in Texas, will use wind and solar power to make hydrogen that will be
combined with carbon dioxide to create synthetic methane.

Canada/ Oil pipeline
The govt will provide C$3 billion in loans to Trans Mountain Corp (TMC), which is
building a long-delayed oil pipeline expansion that will triple the flow of crude (to
890,000 bpd) from Alberta's oil sands to the Pacific coast. Most will be exported to
Asian refining markets

China/ India/ Oil imports
In May, Russian crude oil imports by China and India hit an all-time high as buyers
snapped up discounted supplies. The world's No. 1 and No. 3 crude importers and
top buyers of Russian oil imported about 110 million barrels in May, reported Kpler,
which was up 10% from April despite U.S. warnings against price cap evasion.
India/ Clean energy
State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp will invest $12 billion by 2030 to develop 10
GW of green energy projects. The company produces more than half of India’s oil and
gas. It wants to focus on using clean energy to produce ammonia and other
technologies that offer around-the-clock generation.

Indonesia/ LNG
Indonesia might place caps on LNG exports, adding it to a list of critical raw materials
subject to export controls. The goal of such limits, if enacted, is to secure sufficient
supply for domestic consumption and encourage domestic industrial growth. Existing
export commitments won’t be impacted, said the govt.

Portugal/ Offshore wind power
The country will have its first auction of licenses to build offshore wind farms for a total
capacity of about 1 GW. Portugal will invest €30-€40 billion by 2030 to build a total of
10 GW of offshore wind capacity.

Qatar/ LNG deal
QatarEnergy will sign a long-term LNG supply contract with Bangladesh's state-owned
Petrobangla. The 15-year agreement is for a supply of 2 million tons annually. This is
the second Asian deal for Qatar's North Field project.

Russia/ Oil pipeline
On June 1, Ukraine raised transit fees for Russian oil running via the Druzhba pipeline.
The transport of crude to Hungary and Slovakia rose €3.4/ ton to €17, bringing the
total hike to 25% so far this year. This increase was the second this year; in January,
Kiev raised the tariff 18.3%.

Ukraine/ Power capacity
Power generation capacity dropped by 23 GW, or about 40% of the 2021 total of 58
GW. Kiev cited both war damage to power generation infrastructure and the fact that
some regions are under Russian control. The Zaporozhye NPP, which generated about
20% of all energy produced in Ukraine, is now controlled by Russian forces.

U.S./ Battery storage
Energy storage companies attracted $5.5 billion in 2022, and there are plans to install
65 GW of grid storage nationally by 2030, which is 15 times the 4 GW added in 2022.
Texas will account for nearly 25% of the U.S. grid-scale storage market over the next
five years. These projects are helped by a 30% tax credit for energy storage in the
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
