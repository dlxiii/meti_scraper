NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Kishida tells METI to run more nuclear and thermal plants this winter
(Japan NRG, July 14)
•  Prime Minister Kishida asked the METI minister to run more nuclear and thermal plants in winter to
avoid a power crunch. METI will restart nuclear power plants so that up to nine will be operational,
supplying 10% of the country's power. Presently five nuclear power plants are operational,
supplying around 4% of Japan’s power.
•  METI will also restart 10 more thermal power plants.

•  For the coming summer months, Kishida said there’s enough power capacity on hand to beat
summer heat waves as over 10 thermal power plants had recently restarted.
•  Kishida also plans a new framework to reduce power cost burdens on consumers.
•  CONTEXT: In March, nuclear plants supplied 4 billion kWh and thermal plants 59 billion kWh, out
of the national total of 72 billion kWh.
• TAKEAWAY: Initially, Kishida’s announcement was interpreted as the prime minister ordering the restart of

nine more reactors - something that he is not at liberty to do. On closer inspection, however, his comments
simply refer to the government expecting to have “up to nine” nuclear reactors operating in Japan during the
winter months. That corresponds exactly with the operating and maintenance schedules of power utilities for
their nuclear facilities. The nine units would be online in the Kansai, Shikoku and Kyushu regions by the time
the winter peak demand season of January 2023 arrives.

• It may be possible for utilities to accelerate some restarts. Normally, that would not be necessary as it would
make little impact on meeting peak power demand. However, the summer power peak came early, with June
temperatures the hottest on record. The government and utilities may be mindful of the need to prepare for
an unusually early cold snap.

• Presently, Ohi No. 3, Ikata No. 3, Genkai No. 4, Sendai No.1 and No.2 nuclear reactors are in operation.




Offshore wind auction panel proposes to limit award capacity, not bids
(Japan NRG, July 13)
•  Heads of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism advisory panel, and that of
METI, jointly discussed offshore wind auction rule changes and processed a final proposal after
panel members failed to reach a consensus.
•  The panel heads suggested limiting the capacity to be awarded to a single consortium, while not

restricting a consortium’s capacity to place bids.
•  CONTEXT: In response to criticisms of the Mitsubishi consortium winning all three major projects
in the recent auction round, METI proposed to set a cap on the capacity of a single consortium to
participate in one auction bundling several projects.
•  The proposed rule changes will be open for public discussion later this month and will be finalized
in August-September.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: Auction rule committee panelists are divided on every item, even on the need to change the
rules as well as the process of rule changes. Public comments may also be similarly divided. Major issues
include: fair and competitive auction vs. robust sectoral growth; speedy rollout vs quality and safety guarantee;
the level of information disclosure. This sector requires patience as there will clearly be an adjustment period
before the next auction takes place.



Govt. mulls the introduction of income guarantee program to boost nuclear power
(Nikkei, July 18)
•  The government needs to address issues such as the long payback period for investment in nuclear

power, according to an advisory panel to METI. To do that, the panel proposed to consider
introducing an income guarantee scheme to stabilize the revenue from nuclear power plants.
•  Such a system would support new nuclear capacity that might find itself not able to compete in the
electricity market with more agile renewable energy projects.
•  According to METI officials, a similar approach is being taken in the UK and shows the need to
think about energy security outside of power prices.
•  Public response to this will be key.



METI to push “user-driven alliances” to help mini-solar operators
(Japan NRG, July 13)
•  METI is pushing “user-driven alliances” where users cooperate to develop renewable power

sources. As renewable project sizes get smaller, the chances of power operators closing are
greater if financial prospects turn grim.
•  METI will provide an annual total of ¥26 billion to user groups that commit to 20-years of
renewable power. Long-term user commitment could motivate small solar operators, mostly
individuals, to continue to run their plants.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is in the world’s top three in terms of solar power installed, but 34% of that is from units of
less than 50 kW. Individuals account for 64% of the ownership in the 10-50 kW category and 95% for units of

below 10 kW. User-driven alliances and aggregators may not be effective at keeping these small plants
running until 2050. There is a risk that as owners pass away no one takes over. The cost of identifying new
owners is not negligible. Hence some experts argue that in order to improve the overall operating costs, the
launch of mini-power stations should be restricted.



JMA to work closer with grids to improve renewable output forecast

(Government Statement, July 13)
•  The Japan Meteorological Agency will work closer with national grids to improve the renewable
output forecast.
•  The cost of backing up potential low renewable power generation due to weather is weighing on
the grids. A more accurate forecast would alleviate the backup cost, but JMA data fed into grid
forecast systems don’t have sufficient local details and grids have limited capacity to improve data
accuracy, said the Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of Transmission Operators

(OCCTO).

China closes in on Japan’s hydrogen technology patent lead
(Nikkei Asia, July 13)
•  The pace of Japanese new patent filings for hydrogen has slowed in the last decade, according to
Nikkei and a related research firm, Astamuse. Meanwhile, China’s R&D has accelerated since the

middle of the last decade.
•  Japan still leads overall and is strong in areas such as fuel-cell patents, as it is mainly considered for
applications in mobility. China is now ahead in patents for the manufacture, storage, and safety
controls, among others.
•  Of the world's 20 most competitive companies and organizations on hydrogen technology, eight
are Japanese. Toyota was ranked first.
•  Following a tenfold increase in its patents between 2001 and 2010, China came in second over the U.S.,

South Korea and Germany.


Opinion: Government can’t keep delaying energy decisions
(Nikkei, July 11)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by climate change editor Hanawa Kazunari.
•  Energy policy is the greatest challenge faced by the Kishida government after the election on
Sunday.
•  Record temperatures mean energy suppliers continue to walk a tightrope, while the Ukraine crisis
reveals the risks involved in relying on fossil fuels.

•  The government can’t delay debate on nuclear policy or carbon planning.
•  While the government identified the need to upgrade energy storage and transmission
infrastructure, it’s done little to improve the situation.
•  No progress was made in restarting idle nuclear reactors, with only 10 of the 17 reactors given the
restart green light by the Regulation Authority.
•  PM Kishida must step in to persuade communities living near nuclear power stations to give

approval to reactor restarts.



Panasonic to build a second, $4bn EV battery plant in the U.S.
(Company Statement, July 14)
•  Panasonic will build a $4 billion EV battery factory in Kansas, its second such plant in the U.S. It will
focus on lithium ion batteries.
•  The firm already has a facility in Nevada.

•  CONTEXT: Panasonic plans to triple EV battery production capacity by FY2028 from today’s
roughly 50 Gwh/ year. Its main client is Tesla.

•  The five companies believe that not only electrification but also hydrogen engines are options for
decarbonization of transport.



Mitsui subsidiary to start offering online purchase of carbon offsets
(New Energy Business News, July 14)
•  e-dash, a subsidiary of Mitsui & Co., formed a business alliance with Patch Technologies, a U.S.
climate change tech firm, to become the first Japanese company to offer online purchase of
carbon offsets.
•  The e-dash Carbon Offset service allows purchase of voluntary carbon credits in small amounts, for

example, of less than one ton, depending on the situation.
•  e-dash is developing a SaaS for visualization and reduction of CO2 emissions, but its carbon offset
service will be offered with no membership or monthly fee. The program is not linked to
government-led schemes such as J-credits.



Kansai Electric and ORIX to build a battery storage plant in Wakayama area

University invents highly-efficient sunlight hydrogen technology
(Newswitch, July 6)
•  Niigata University researchers developed a system that combines PV cells and electrolytics to
produce hydrogen from sunlight, achieving a record 13.9% efficiency.
•  The team wants to boost efficiency to 25%.

•  Featuring a cathode made from oxides of ferro tungsten nickel alloy and an anode made from
platinum, the system can generate hydrogen at voltages as low as 240 mV — around 24% lower
than existing technology.



Kyushu plant prepares for glut of discarded panels

(Newswitch, July 11)
•  A recycling plant opened in Kitakyushu with capacity to annually process 1,400 metric tons of used
solar panels, the equivalent of 90,000 panels.
•  By firing panels at high temperature, the plastic supporting the material is burnt off, enabling
panels to be separated into glass silicon and copper. Heat yielded from the burning plastic is used
to drive the reaction.
•  The plant can also process broken panels, something formerly considered impracticable, with

sifting and air-current based separation techniques developed by Waseda University.
•  Plant operator Shinryo says the number of PV panels discarded each year will increase starting in
2030.



Marubeni and Osaka Gas join methanation venture in Peru

(Nikkei, July 14)
•  Marubeni agreed with Peru LNG SRL (a JV with Marubeni) and Osaka Gas to study the feasibility of
methanation in Peru.
•  Methanation can reduce the carbon footprint of gas use. In the latest energy roadmap, Japan’s
government aims to make synthetic methane 1% of reticulated gas supply by 2030, increasing to
90% by 2050.

Top wind turbine makers reconsider entry into Japan market after rule changes
(Nikkei, July 15)
•  Top manufacturers of wind turbines used for offshore wind power generation are reviewing their
entry into the Japanese market. Denmark’s Vestas has canceled plans to build a local factory in
Nagasaki Prefecture, and Siemens Gamesa told operators in Japan that it will not supply offshore
wind turbines to Japan.

•  CONTEXT: Mitsubishi Corp.’s win in all three of last year’s fixed bottom wind tenders led to
intense industry lobbying for rule changes to new project auctions. The government has complied,
with some proposed changes seeking to put a limit on how much capacity one firm can win.
•  The new rules make overseas makers fear for profitability of their Japan-based business. It is
considered cheaper to import equipment than to build locally.
• TAKEAWAY: Outside of Chinese turbine makers, which mostly supply their home market, Vestas, Gamesa and

GE are the big global players. GE partnered with Toshiba to make turbine parts in Japan, but the others have
yet to establish a local production base.
• Mitsubishi picked GE’s turbines for all three of its offshore wind projects.



Kyushu and Kansai utilities restart nuclear reactors to ease power crunch
(Japan NRG, July 18)
•  Kansai Electric restarted Unit 4 of the Ohi nuclear power plant on July 17, about 10 days later than

initially planned after leaks were discovered during maintenance.
•  Kyushu Electric restarted Unit 4 of the Genkai NPP on July 10 after regular maintenance. The utility
now has three of its four units online.
•  CONTEXT: The Kansai area’s power crunch is among the most severe in the nation. Even after the
restart of Ohi Unit 4, Kansai Electric has just two of its seven reactors online. The utility does,
however, expect most of its nuclear units to be operational in time for the winter peak demand

period.
• TAKEAWAY: PM Kishida has called for more nuclear power to be brought online to cope with various energy
shortages. This has yet to translate into major changes in the nuclear industry as the only three utilities to run
NPPs in the country remain Kansai, Kyushu and Shikoku Electric.



Toshiba Energy Systems sees future in VPP business, hydrogen fuel cells
(Denki Shimbun, July 15)
•  New Toshiba Energy Systems president Yotsuyanagi Tadasu took over in June. In an interview he
said: “power generation, transmission, and substations are our core business. Profits from these
operations are the source of investment in new businesses. We need to balance R&D with existing

business.”

•  “Our core business will not suddenly decline, but it also will not grow rapidly. The company's
vision is … to achieve sales of ¥1 trillion in FY2030.”
•  Toshiba’s management policy is now focused on data. For the energy sector, that means "VPP is
the key. Matching electricity supply and demand is an important part of our energy data business.”
•  “To support stable operation of thermal power and other power sources, we also propose

switching from time-based periodic inspections to operations that repair equipment according to
its condition. We want to improve the operating rate of power plants by using data to identify the
cause of problems and propose better ways to deal with them.”
•  New hardware products: "We want to expand our hydrogen fuel cell business.”

Court orders ex-Tepco executives to pay ¥13 trillion in damages for accident

(TV Asahi, July 14)
•  The Tokyo District Court ordered four former executives of TEPCO to pay the utility about ¥13
trillion in damages for failing to take tsunami countermeasures. The case against ex-TEPCO
executives was filed by company shareholders.
•  This is the first time a court has held management personally responsible for a nuclear accident. It
is also Japan’s highest award in a civil court case.
•  The Tokyo District Court ruled that the company lacked safety awareness and a sense of

responsibility. This negligence, it was argued, led to the accident and its consequences, including
massive losses for the company and shareholders.
•  CONTEXT: The plaintiffs claimed that five TEPCO executives, led by then chair Katsumata, ignored
tsunami calculations made by their own subsidiary in 2008 based on earthquake forecasts released
by a government agency in 2002.
• TAKEAWAY: In the eyes of Japan’s public, both the government and TEPCO avoided responsibility for

Fukushima. This led to much frustration and may have added to the post-accident distrust of nuclear power. It
has taken over 10 years and soaring electricity prices to win back majority support for nuclear plant restarts.
This court decision will surely make some utilities nervous about operating reactors going forward. Executive
liability can be capped with special insurance schemes.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Fukushima evacuees praise TEPCO decision
(Chunichi Shimbun, July 14)
o  Former residents of Fukushima, who fled to the Chubu region after the disaster, have
praised the court’s decision to fine former TEPCO executives.
o  Evacuee Aota Katsuhiko, who fled to the Ootsu municipality with his family after the

disaster, criticized the way the former executive attempted to place all blame for the
accident on the record-sized tsunami.
o  Fellow evacuee Igarashi Hiroko hopes the decision will embolden groups around Japan
that are lobbying to stop the restart of idle reactors.
o  Igarashi says that unforeseen events can no longer be used as an excuse for failing to
ensure the safety of reactors; the government needs to rethink the role of nuclear power.

ANALYSIS

BY YOSHIHISA OHNO

Tokyo Avoids a Power Crunch (So Far);
But System in Place to Prevent Crises Falls Short

In late June, Tokyo faced a severe power crunch, the second in four months.
Foreseeing the problems that the hottest June record would create with electricity
supply, the government made an impassioned plea to both businesses and
households to conserve energy to avoid blackouts.

The response was heartening and the danger passed. But in fact, Japan already has a
market-based mechanism to cope with times of power crises.
Rather than appealing to the social consciousness of citizens, the government should
have been able to rely on the so-called Balancing Market set up to cope with exactly
this kind of emergency. Worryingly, the Balancing Market failed to deliver. When the
Tokyo area grid operator turned to the market for help, none was forthcoming.

The mechanism’s failure to resolve power crunches must be addressed. An initial
assessment suggests that its modus operandi no longer fits with on-the-ground reality.


Spare capacity eroded
Before Japan liberalized its electricity market in 2016, regional power companies were
fully responsible for all facets of power supply. They ran operations with a view of
maintaining some power plants in reserve to make sure there was at least 7% of spare
capacity to deal with emergencies.
As a result, Japan boasted the world’s lowest rate of power outages.
After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the majority of the nation’s nuclear baseload
power was taken offline. Even today, none of the nuclear plants in the country’s east,
which covers the home territories of TEPCO, Tohoku Electric and Hokkaido Electric,
have been able to restart.

Saddled with maintaining and upgrading non-operating nuclear reactors while trying
to compete in a newly liberalized electricity industry, the big utilities have mothballed
many of their older and inefficient thermal power plants, eroding the spare capacity
available to the power system. This year, Japan faces its lowest level of thermal power
generation capacity available in years.
To make sure Japan’s power system could at least maintain some buffer for times of
need, the government set up several mechanisms, chief among them the Balancing
Market. The market allowed power companies and other businesses that own
generation assets to contract some of their capacity to this market, receiving
compensation for keeping it available for emergencies.

The adjustment mechanism splits power plants and power conservation services into
several categories. The top one was Power Source I, which largely refers to power
plants that can be started up very quickly (i.e., within 5 minutes) and are owned by
large utilities close to the grid operators and, thus, quick to answer the call to action.

Other categories encompass power generation that’s less susceptible to grid
company command and / or plants that take time to ramp up and down, such as
nuclear reactors.
A key category to note, however, is Power Source (cid:0)‘. In addition to some thermal and
pumped hydro generation, it relies on “demand-response” services. The latter refer to
ways that power providers can encourage consumers to lower electricity use during a
crunch period with incentives.

There are few demand-response service providers in Japan. The niche was pioneered
in Japan by a French company, Energy Pool, around the middle of the last decade.
But, the popularity of demand-response services in Japan is growing. Its providers
help mostly industrial and commercial users set clearly defined roadmaps to reduce
energy use in response to a call from the power system operator.
The impact of demand-response measures can be significant, but the way that Power
Source I‘ contracts are ordered in Japan proved a key reason why the adjustment
failed to provide support for the Tokyo area during the June shortages. These
contracts specify that power conservation measures and / or additional capacity must
only be made available during the two peak summer and the two peak winter months.


Power Source I Capacity that is always secured by transmission and distribution operators (likely
belongs to the generation firm closely aligned with the local grid company); can be
made available within 5 minutes

Power Source I‘ Capacity that can be made available in extremely harsh conditions, such as once-in-
a-decade crises; can be made available within 3 hours

Contract period is limited to 9:00 to 20:00, July to September (summer), and
December to February (winter) peak seasons

June was too soon
This year’s first power crunch came in March, after a major earthquake offshore from
the Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, as well as Tokyo’s unusually severe cold
weather and snow, cut available supply and increased demand. The government was
slow to issue an alert to notify the public about the risks, with the official
announcement coming after 21:00 the night before the day of expected shortages.

Still, Tokyo’s power grid scored a lucky win. Despite the late call, Energy Pool Japan
via its demand-response clients managed to shave off 300 MW to 500 MW of demand
from the system, easing the burden on supply. Equally, strong public support in
cutting electricity use in homes helped demand in the Tokyo area drop by a third in
the afternoon of March 21, the most critical period.
While the response was good, it was clear that potential summer shortages would be
more prolonged. The government adjusted the alerts system so as to warn users
about a crunch two nights before it was due.

Despite the extra warning, when it came to the crunch in late June, TEPCO got no
support from Power Source I‘ clients whatsoever. In other words, no factories or
businesses cut demand according to contract rules, because it was still June and their
contracts kicked in only in July.
The system designed to deal with “extremely harsh conditions, such as occur once in
a decade” failed because no one was ready to deal with a power crunch outside of
the usual power crunch season.

TEPCO filled the gaps in other ways, such as additional supply from industrial firms
with in-house power plants. Starting this month, around 7 GW of capacity is scheduled
back online after maintenance work – just in time for the official peak power demand
season.
Still, one obvious conclusion is that Japan’s changing climate patterns show that crises
can occur at any time. The government and power industry need to prepare demand-
responses and other conservation strategies to engage at any time of year.

The entrenched notion of ‘peak season’ is being shaken. The legal and market
frameworks need to adjust once again to make sure that Japan’s official mechanisms
are relevant going forward and that the country doesn’t have to rely on social
consciousness alone to navigate difficult times.

Bracing for Loss of Russian LNG, Japan Steps Up Gas Conservation

Power crunches are increasingly common in Japan, and shortages of natural gas are
the new reality. For the first time ever, the government has embarked on a review on
what measures can be taken to conserve use of the fuel.

METI hasn’t elaborated on the reasons why Japan is suddenly taking such a course.
The ministry’s external advisors, however, have been more forthcoming: there’s a risk
of Japan losing access to Russian supplies of LNG, which are about 10% of the
nation’s total.

Devising gas conservation measures isn’t straightforward. In the past decade, the
rising frequency of short-term shortages of electricity supply have helped forge an
evolving government, business and now even household response. The topic even
airs on morning chat shows.

The regulatory basis for gas is quite different than for electricity.


Gas Business Act  Gas operators need to coordinate/collaborate to maintain gas pipeline
networks and to enhance users' benefit (58th article)


Electricity Business Act Power operators need to coordinate/collaborate to serve public interest
and to ensure supply security (28th article)



Legal framework needs to be amended
Japan’s gas sector is regulated under the Gas Business Act, which unlike the
Electricity Business Act does not have a clause that empowers the state to intervene in
case of emergencies. For this reason, METI can only hope that voluntary actions from
industry users are good enough to overcome a crisis.

Hope is not enough, though, and one of the most influential METI advisors, Prof.
Kikkawa Takeo of International University, is calling for the Gas Business Act to be
amended before the heating demand season arrives in January.
While METI’s official position is that Japan is not currently facing a threat to its gas
supply, the launch of a public-private debate around gas conservation in recent
months has set off some anxiety among major gas consumers.

For now, METI is asking users to voluntarily conserve gas. If further consumption cuts
are needed, then it will file direct requests to large consumers. Businesses account for
70% of national city gas consumption. METI says it would focus conservation requests
on users that have the capacity to switch to other sources.

As such, the government is asking all firms to rewrite business continuity plans to
include gas supply cuts in risk scenarios. METI’s current thinking is to form an alert

system in times of supply crunch similar to that used in the electricity sector. There
would be warnings of different levels relative to the degree of shortages.


Substitution options?
Gas and power are both essential national energy infrastructure, complementing one
another. Last January, when gas heating systems were in short supply due to cuts in
imports of semiconductors, home builders shifted to electric central heating systems.

After the recent June power crunch, end-users are again shifting back to gas. This
symbiosis suggests that power and gas conservation policy making should be
centralized, rather than split between two separate METI regulator bodies. Ultimately,
a shortage in one of the two areas can stall the entire energy system.

Substitution of gas with oil or coal are also no longer seen as the easy, go-to solution
due to their high prices. While Japan’s import price for LNG is up 121% YoY, coal
prices are up 227% in the same period.

“At the end of the day, energy conservation is critical for national security,” said one
METI gas panel member.


Big differences between power and gas
The power sector was able to build up a national power conservation structure
following the Fukushima crisis and other earthquakes that damaged thermal power
plants in subsequent years.

“Gas supply cuts were not seen as a risk… thanks to gas utilities managing their
resources extremely well. You can never thank them enough,” Tokyo University
professor Matsumura Toshihiro told the METI gas panel.

METI is not able to oversee gas and power sectors single-handedly, as the room for
active state intervention is limited for gas due to the legal framework. In addition,
while any power contracts with large business users tend to include a clause that
allows grid operators to curtail supply in times of emergencies, very few gas contracts
have similar clauses.

Gas and power are structured differently. While the power sector is dominated by the
10 former regional monopolies, also known as EPCos, Japan’s gas supply is split
between 193 mostly small enterprises with just four major firms in the industry. In rural
areas with less than 50,000 inhabitants, there is no city gas operator. Power grid
companies have to cover even the smallest communities.

The 10 regional electricity grids publish supply and demand forecasts on their
websites; data that is updated daily. Such disclosure may not be possible for all gas
suppliers. And yet, without clear data, it will be difficult to push consumers to make
significant savings.

In addition, while power saving can make a difference by being enacted for just a few
hours at certain peak consumption times of the day, gas conservation requires days,
weeks or even months of continuous effort until the next LNG cargo arrives.

The demand response system, where users adjust consumption patterns to match
supply and are compensated for this, may not work as well in the gas sector. Some
suppliers are too small to manage such programs.

Lastly, due to the spread of smart meters, grids can gauge power consumption and
supply on a real time basis. It takes time for the gas system to grasp real-time
consumption trends.

One thing is clear. The gas and power facilities need to work closely together so that
ministry action – from non-legally binding conservation requests and guidelines, to
ordinances and ministerial orders – improve total energy efficiency.

In a worst-case scenario, the gas industry will repeat the mistakes of its power sector
cousin by shutting all the old, inefficient facilities used as a buffer in times of crises.
Unlike electricity, which has at least several sources of generation, there are few
alternatives to gas for heating and industrial use.

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Algeria/ Solar power
The first electricity from the 1 GW “Solar 1,000” project is expected in late 2023 when
a 30 MW solar park in Bechar province goes online. International investors are invited
to join the project. Algeria plans 15 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2035.

Germany/ Natural gas
Uniper, Europe’s largest buyer of Russian gas, seeks a state rescue as it faces
insolvency due to a drastic reduction in Russian gas. Uniper has been losing tens of
millions of euros a day as it has to buy expensive gas on spot markets but is unable to
pass on the extra cost to customers.

Hungary/ Energy crisis
The government declared a "state of emergency" over supply disruptions and rising
energy prices, and it plans to increase domestic energy production to ensure supply.
The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán blames the war in Ukraine and
western sanctions on Russia for the energy crisis.

Kazakhstan/ Oil pipeline
Last week, a Russian court ordered a 30-day stoppage on operations of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium, which sends oil from Kazakhstan via Russia to Black Sea ports,
due to concerns about spills. CPC’s shareholders include Shell, ExxonMobil and
Chevron. This week, that decision was overturned, ending the threat of disruption.
Malaysia/ Oil legal case
Two Luxembourg-based subsidiaries of state oil company Petronas were seized by
descendants of a late sultan in a dispute over an agreement dating to 1878. The
subsidiaries — Petronas Azerbaijan and Petronas South Caucasus — had gas interests
in Azerbaijan worth more than $2 billion. In March, an arbitrator in France ruled that
Malaysia must pay the heirs $15 billion.

OPEC/ Oil demand
In 2023, global oil demand will rise to levels that OPEC will struggle to meet. The
amount of oil that the group must pump to meet global demand, also known as the
“call on Opec crude”, could rise to 32 mbpd by the end of 2023.

Russia/ Gas pipeline
Russia’s main gas pipeline to Germany went offline for scheduled maintenance, amid
fears whether Gazprom will restart deliveries through Nord Stream 1 once those
repairs end on July 21.

Russia/ Oil assets
Commodity trader Trafigura sold a multibillion-dollar 10% stake in Vostok Oil, which is
in Russia's Arctic region, to Hong Kong-based Nord Axis Ltd. Corporate filings show
Nord Axis was incorporated on Feb. 15, a week before Russia launched a full-scale
attack on Ukraine.

Saudi Arabia/ Oil
Reuters reports that the world's largest oil exporter more than doubled Russian oil
imports in Q2 in order to feed power stations to meet summer cooling demand and
free up the kingdom’s own crude for export. Russia is selling fuel at discounted prices
following international sanctions.

U.S./ Oil leases
The White House is preparing proposals for new oil lease auctions in federal waters
over the next five years. Options range from 10 lease sales in the Gulf, plus another
off Alaska, to no new lease sales at all. In related news, Houston-based Pickering
Energy Partners, with an unnamed institutional investor, will spend $300 million to
acquire and develop oil and gas assets in the Permian Basin.

U.S./ Power generation
Power generation from utility-scale renewables reached 85.3 million MWh in April,
down from 87.1 million MWh in March, supplying 28% of U.S. power for the month.
Wind generation supplied 46.2 million MWh, accounting for over half of the total
renewable output; while utility-scale solar supplied 13.5 million MWh, or 15.8%.

UK/ BHP lawsuit
A £5 billion lawsuit against BHP by 202,600 Brazilian claimants will go ahead in an
English court. The judges overturned a 2018 decision that the courts should not hear
the case. The lawsuit centers on Brazil’s worst environmental disaster, when the
Fundão Dam collapsed in 2015, releasing 40 million cubic meters of tailings from iron
ore mining.
