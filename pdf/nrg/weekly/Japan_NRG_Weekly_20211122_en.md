NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


PM Kishida unveils Japan’s second-largest stimulus package at ¥78.9 trillion

(Japan NRG, Nov. 20)
•  On Nov. 19 Prime Minister Kishida announced a ¥78.9 trillion (~$700 billion) stimulus package, the
second largest in Japan’s history.
•  It’s due to be approved by the Cabinet on Nov. 26 and by parliament before the end of the year.
•  The package contains some limited positive elements for Japan’s energy complex, but lacks
substance around energy transition infrastructure despite coming a week after PM Kishida
attended the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
•  The $700 billion package includes central government expenditure of $300 billion, local

government stimulus, and loan programs. A previous package announced in April last year
amounted to ¥48 trillion ($420 billion).
•  The new stimulus is equivalent to 10% of Japan’s GDP. The government expects the funding
should boost GDP by 5.6%.
•  Cumulative Japanese fiscal stimulus since the outbreak of Covid in Q1 2020, including this most
recent announcement, amounts to almost 30% of GDP, or $1.5 trillion. By comparison the two

stimulus bills introduced by President Biden in the U.S., the Infrastructure and the Build Back Better
Bills, amount to $3 trillion.
•  The latest Japanese package includes:
o  ¥5/ liter subsidy for gasoline wholesalers to keep prices below the important ¥170/ liter
retail threshold at the pump;
o  $10 billion university endowment fund to strengthen supply chain resilience;
o  $5 billion develop the semiconductor and AI industries;

o  $5 billion for a new fund to bolster Japan’s economic security;
o  $1 billion to subsidize cutting-edge battery factories;
o  $7.5 billion for defense-related items such as missiles and aircraft, the first time such
expenditure was included in a supplementary budget.
•  The budget also outlines a ¥15 trillion, five-year plan for the National Resilience initiative, which
seeks to install measures to improve critical infrastructure, including energy, in order to deal with

natural disasters and to digitize.
•  The full budget for 2022 is expected to be drafted next month.
• TAKEAWAY: The stimulus tries to please the broader public, business and society, including with some cash
handouts as PM Kishida and the ruling LDP look ahead to the Upper House elections next summer. However,
the stimulus does not seem to put as much emphasis on providing relief for retail from the more expensive
energy input costs, or mention much about the need to revamp the power grid in order to accommodate a
greater reliance on variable renewable energy sources, as per the Basic Energy Plan. Given the accelerated

timetable to decarbonize post Glasgow, Japan will need to put as much emphasis on energy/emissions
counter-measures as is currently being afforded in the battle with Covid-19.



Japan may release of oil from national reserves for the first time
(Jiji News, Nov. 20)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  PM Kishida confirmed that his government is considering a release of crude oil from the nation’s
strategic reserves in response to soaring oil prices. This would be a first for Japan.
•  Some oil was released into the market from Japan’s private stockpiles in 2011 in response to the
deteriorating situation in Libya.
•  The PM said the government is considering whether tapping into the national reserves can be

done from a legal standpoint.
•  Kishida also noted that Japan may cooperate with the U.S. and other concerned countries on the
oil release.
•  The U.S. has asked other major oil consumers such as Japan and China to make a release from
national stockpiles in order to coordinate action.
•  CONTEXT: Japan's oil stockpiling law allows for reserves to be used only at a time of supply

constraints or natural disasters, but not as a tool to lower prices. However, the government
believes there’s currently a surplus in the domestic stockpile.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Oil release decided, due this week in concert with U.S.
(Yomiuri Shimbun, Nov. 21)
o  The government will go ahead with a release of oil from stockpiles to cope with high oil

prices.
o  The U.S. and Japan seek to announce the release of oil reserves by the end of the week
in a coordinated action.
o  The Biden administration has been in talks with Japan, South Korea and other countries
on the oil market move.
o  CONTEXT: As of the end of September, the national stockpile was equivalent to 145
days of domestic consumption. The Oil Stockpiling Law stipulates that the national

stockpile must be at least 90 days’ worth of imports.
• TAKEAWAY: As oil prices surge, and the yen weakens, the cost of imports starts to rise rapidly. For a country
that imports most of its food and nearly all of its energy, that’s a sure-fire way to see general living standards
drop as food and energy (and transport) inflation works its way into the economy. Amazingly, the consumer
price index in Japan remains unphased for now, the same as always, But, more specific gauges reveal a
different picture. Wholesale inflation hit a four-decade high in October because of global logistics failures and
rising commodity costs. The index that measures the prices that companies charge each other for goods and

services was up 8% YoY in October, according to Bank of Japan data.
• Japan has already asked some Middle East suppliers to raise crude output, but individual countries are
beholden to OPEC+ decisions. So, this time PM Kishida is playing the political card (in cooperating with the

U.S.). The big unknown is how effective the measures will be. Unless the oil release is done in a sustained way,
it’s hard to see an impact on prices beyond the first few days after the announcement.



Carbon tax postponed
(Sankei Shimbun, Nov. 13)
•  The govt. will postpone a new carbon pricing plan until after FY2022.
•  The plan is opposed by industry, with the Keidanren calling for caution so as not to negatively

impact industry.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Experts criticized the plan, saying it could delay efforts to help businesses recover after the Covid
19 pandemic and high oil prices.
•  Japan was criticized at the recent COP26 for failing to present a roadmap for divesting from coal-
fired power generation.




More than 250 companies in Japan commit to net-zero: survey
(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 17)
•  More than 250 Japanese corporations pledged to attain net-zero GHG emissions or better,
according to a Nikkei survey.
•  More than half were made this year with an eye on COP26.
•  The Nikkei received responses from 846 Japanese companies about how they plan to contribute

to UN sustainability goals.
•  246 companies pledged to be carbon neutral. Another 21 have a "carbon negative" commitment
to remove more than they produce.
•  Out of these 267 companies, about 79% set goals for 2050 or later. About 43% plan to achieve
targets in the 2030s.
•  Also, 377 companies track the GHG output of their suppliers.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Honda sets net-zero target for entire supply chain
(Nikkei, Nov. 16)
o  Automaker asks main suppliers to cut carbon emissions 4% annually versus 2019 levels.
o  Honda is the first Japanese automaker to mandate long-term emissions reduction target
to its suppliers.




METI revises Alaska methane hydrate project schedule
(Japan NRG, Nov. 17)
•  METI revised development schedules of methane hydrate in sandy sediments. Together with the
U.S. National Energy Technology Laboratory, METI will determine if project sites in Alaska have

enough reserves. The goal is to develop methane hydrate as sources of ammonia and hydrogen. If
a site has reserves that can output 50,000 m2/day and if total reserves exceed 10 billion m2, then
the project can be profitable.
•  Domestic exploration had been on hold due to problems with the state-owned exploration vessel
Tansa. The prospecting phase will be delayed by a year, to 2022, and the research and
development of mining technologies to 2023. Nevertheless, methane hydrate mining can go
ahead in 2023-2027, as stated in the 2030 Basic Energy Plan.
•  Separately, The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology will conduct

prospecting surveys for surface methane hydrate in the Sea of Japan.
•  CONTEXT: Methane hydrate is a form of natural gas, but it’s not clear if its exploration is subject to
a ban in some jurisdictions. A METI official told Japan NRG it hasn’t started drilling, hasn’t
determined the technologies to be used, and hasn’t measured carbon emissions during extraction.
•  Japan produced 1.93 million tons of hydrogen mainly from oil refineries in 2020. It aims to supply 2
million tons in 2025; 3 million tons in 2030; and 20 million tons in 2050.

Shipper Mitsui O.S.K. to double funding for decarbonization to $3.5 billion
(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 20)
•  Shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines will invest around ¥400 billion ($3.5 billion) in
decarbonization efforts over three years, almost twice the previous three-year plan, President
Hashimoto said in an interview to Nikkei.
•  The firm will use a significant increase in cash flow from the current shipping boom globally to

finance the plan, which includes a shift toward operating vessels that use LNG as fuel rather than
the more polluting fuel oil.
•  CONTEXT: Mitsui O.S.K. plans to own 90 LNG-powered vessels by 2030.
•  Mitsui O.S.K. is also investing in green ammonia. There is not enough global production to employ
ammonia to fuel ships at this moment, but the company feels sure that this is the future trend and
wants to get ahead of rivals.
•  The company announced in May that it would resume transporting ammonia for the first time in

half a decade. It is expected to invest in new production and storage facilities, with an eye on
markets like Australia, Russia and the Middle East.
•  Mitsui O.S.K. will also consider producing and exporting ammonia derived from natural gas. "We
will look into ammonia-related mergers and acquisitions as well," Hashimoto said.



Idemitsu to study green hydrogen and ammonia project in Australia

(Sekiyu Tsushin, Nov. 17)
•  Idemitsu Renewable Development Australia Pty, a unit of Idemitsu, is working with the Port of
Newcastle and Macquarie Group on a green hydrogen and ammonia project at the Port of
Newcastle, Australia.
•  The parties signed an MoU to jointly study the feasibility of exporting and bunkering green
hydrogen and ammonia at the Port of Newcastle.
•  The project will commercialize the use of green electricity at the port and the production, storage,

transportation, sale, and export of green hydrogen and ammonia from 2024. The plan includes
export to Japan.

Western Australia in cooperation with Kansai Electric, Hokuriku Electric, Marubeni and others.




Environment Ministry reports Japan’s contributions to Paris Agreement Rulebook
(Japan NRG, Nov. 15)
•  The MoE reported how Japan contributed to the completion of the Paris Agreement Rulebook
negotiations at COP26, proposing a mechanism to prevent double counting of carbon offset
credits. It was also agreed that credits earned under the Kyoto Protocol Clean Development
Mechanism system will be transferrable to the Paris Agreement mechanism. Japan’s delegation

also called for uniform carbon measurement across the globe, which was included in the
agreement.
•  The Conference of the Parties of Paris Agreement (CMA) will continue to discuss the means to
support countries reporting capabilities.
•  CONTEXT: The Institute of Global Environmental Studies said unclear roles and responsibilities of
key ministries and stakeholders, as well as a lack of human resources and experts who understand

GHG inventory methodologies, are key challenges in Asia. Japan will help Southeast Asian nations
develop carbon measurement capacities.



METI panel urges more data disclosure to grids ahead of 2024 capacity auction launch

(Japan NRG, Nov. 18)
•  The METI sub-committee on basic electricity and gas policies urges more data disclosures to
regional power grids ahead of a 2024 capacity auction launch. Following the launch of capacity
auctions, retailers will be required to source supplies through auctions. Retailers need data on
power generation and expected income to make comparisons among power suppliers. The sub-
panel proposes requirements for regional grids to clarify power generation costs and sales costs in
financial statements.

Utilities trial power curbs to conserve LNG fuel even as stocks remain high

(Japan LNG, Nov. 19)
•  Some Japanese power utilities are taking measures to curb power output at thermal power plants
that run on natural gas in order to conserve stocks of LNG ahead of the winter peak period,
Chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, Ikebe Kazuhiro, said.
•  Storage is limited and the issue can’t be solved by buying many additional cargos, said Ikebe, who
is also president of Kyushu Electric.
•  Meanwhile, METI released the latest information about LNG stock levels as Japan heads into the

winter. Power utilities’ reserves are at 2.2 million tons as of Nov. 15, up by 0.6 million tons from the
same time last year and which was the highest in the last five years.
•  Stock levels fell to 2.07 million tons in late Oct. due to strong power demand.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s LNG imports in Oct. were down YoY and on-month, the lowest monthly total
this year.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI reports mid-November LNG stocks of 2.2 million tons

(See Oil & Gas News section for details)
• TAKEAWAY: Ikebe’s comments remind us there’s a limit to how much Japan can stock up on LNG in advance.
The fuel is hard to store and without dedicated underground gas storage facilities, such as in Europe, Japan is
always 2-3 weeks away from running out of fuel without replenishment.

• We’ve written before about building underground gas storage in Japan. It’s costly and geologically
problematic. Thus, the latest strategy is to pursue the wider rollout of LNG infrastructure in Asia and a more
fluid market, allowing countries to exchange supplies. However, it’s less clear how that will work if a cold snap
hits north Asia. China, South Korea and Japan are the biggest LNG buyers and users. It’s hard for other Asian
nations to “offset” that volume in times of real need.

• In that context, it’s not surprising to hear that JERA has invested $2.5 billion in the Freeport LND
Development. Japan’s biggest LNG importer seeks to help Freeport expand its plant with a fourth production
line; the investment is a way to guarantee that these new volumes could head to Japan in times of tight supply
or emergency, rather than to Europe or elsewhere. The lesson from the last year that many in Japan have
taken is that long-term contracts should remain the foundation of the LNG industry.

JERA invests US$2.5 billion in American LNG
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Nov. 16)
o  JERA will invest an additional $2.5 billion in U.S.-owned Freeport LNG.
o  The investment took the form of the Global Infrastructure Partners’ purchase of a 25.7%

stake in Freeport.
o  After the acquisition, Freeport LNG will be 63.5% owned by the founders, 25.7% by
JERA, and 10.8% by Osaka Gas.
o  The acquisition will be funded by a portion of JERA's cash and deposits of about ¥480
billion, as well as by borrowing. The investment is expected to contribute more than ¥10
billion to net income as of 2025.




Shikoku Electric gets final approval for reactor restart at Ikata nuclear plant
(NHK, Nov. 19)
•  Governor Nakamura of Ehime Prefecture told Shikoku Electric that he approves the restart of Unit 3
reactor at the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, and he wants the company to make safety a top priority.
•  Shikoku Electric President Nagai Keisuke said the utility will announce the reactor restart schedule

on Nov. 22.
•  CONTEXT: Unit 3 at Ikata NPP was shut for maintenance in Dec. 2019, but then faced various
technical and operation issues. One of its emergency standby staff often left his post without
permission.
•  The governor met with the utility’s president and gave the green light to bring the facility online
when satisfied by results site inspections.
• TAKEAWAY: This is an important restart in terms of bringing more baseload capacity online ahead of winter’s

peak power demand. After the recent closure of two reactors, one in Kansai and one in Kyushu, this will
stabilize “gains” made by the nuclear industry in the last year in terms of bringing more plants back online.
• But this is not a major move in the broader nuclear debate. Japan has two types of reactors: ones with

approval to restart and did at some point in the last five years; and those not in operation for about a decade.
The Ikata NPP facility belongs to the former, so switching it back on is relatively easy. How restarts fare with the
latter group will be the real litmus test for Japan’s nuclear revival.



Project uses Toshiba equipment to make world’s first CO2-free power from natural gas

(Japan NRG, Nov. 16)
•  U.S. clean energy firm NET Power delivered CO2-free electricity derived from burning natural gas
to the ERCOT grid (Texas). This is a world-first.
•  NET Power which uses Toshiba equipment, including the turbine, pioneered a technology that
combusts natural gas with pure oxygen instead of air; using the resultant supercritical CO2 (instead
of steam) to generate electricity. That CO2 is captured at the source.
•  The technology claims zero CO2 emissions, and avoids other GHGs.
•  NET Power has a 50 MW test facility in La Porte, Texas.

•  NET Power works with clients worldwide to develop utility-scale NET Power plants, with initial
projects to come online in the next five years. All CO2 captured will be permanently stored or
utilized.
•  CONTEXT: One of NET Power’s key investors is 8 Rivers, a firm that’s developing CCUS
technology and which signed an alliance accord with JX Nippon Oil Exploration, part of the

ENEOS Group, earlier this month.
• TAKEAWAY: This is another solution that relies on carbon capture and storage (CCS), or that and a recycling
component. However, it also allows for gas infrastructure to stay in place. Over two-thirds of GHG emissions
from natural gas come at combustion, so NET Power’s technology promises a major lifeline for the gas and
thermal power industries over the mid to long term.

• While NET Power utilizes Toshiba components it doesn’t yet have Japanese firms among investors. That may
change going forward. One of NET Power’s investors, 8 Rivers, recently connected with ENEOS.

JERA CEO advocates for diversification of LNG supply
(Nikkei, Nov. 17)
•  Regarding last winter’s power crisis, JERA CEO Onoda Satoshi said that in addition to major power

retailers such as TEPCO, many other power users purchase electricity on the wholesale market.
Last winter’s power shortage was exacerbated by the fact that demand data for these users was
not available and therefore not reflected in projections.
•  Onoda says JERA learned from the experience, and will model demand more precisely this year.
JERA may also maintain higher levels of inventory.
•  Onoda predicts continued high petrochemical prices for the near future.
•  He sees a role for LNG as a transitional fuel as the world strives to reduce GHGs, and predicts

demand will increase in the decade’s second half.
•  Onoda says the amount of time needed for LNG shipments and the fact that the fuel can’t be
stored for long periods means it’s difficult to react rapidly to demand blips and supply issues in
Europe. JERA is investing in Asia in order to diversify supply, he said.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE


As Clean Energy Rises
How will Japan’s Oil and Gas Upstream React?

Much of the world’s focus at the COP26 climate summit was on coal. But another
campaign against fossil fuels gained momentum during the event, and that one
promises to be more uncomfortable for Japan’s government and big energy firms
than the conversation over coal.

The summit served as the backdrop for the formation of the Beyond Oil and Gas
Alliance (BOGA). Among signatories are countries such as Denmark, France, Sweden,
and New Zealand, while the state of California and Canada’s Quebec also joined.
BOGA’s aim is to “limit” new sources of oil and gas while acting to “phase out”
existing production.

Japan did not sign up to BOGA. But while the country’s top 10 firms involved in
finding new sources of oil and gas may breathe more easily than counterparts in
Europe and the U.S., BOGA and other campaigns to stymie hydrocarbon
development cannot be easily dismissed. For one, BOGA members have a voice in
some of the areas in which Japanese firms currently operate.

While the government continues to support a target for Japan to be more “self-
sufficient” in terms of access to oil and gas resources it’s unlikely that upstream firms
will face trouble with accessing finance. However, COP26 confirmed that all industries
must now grapple with the challenge of reducing emissions and striving toward net-
zero targets. No sector will feel the pressure greater than the upstream operations of
oil and gas firms, which account for almost two-thirds of the industry’s greenhouse gas
emissions.


Managing international pressure
The lifeblood of any large-scale resource development is financing, which can come
either from the markets or directly from banks. While both avenues are becoming
tricky for western energy firms, Japanese counterparts are, relatively speaking, in a
sweet spot.

Most of the top 10 upstream companies - INPEX, JAPEX, JX Nippon Oil and Gas
Exploration, Idemitsu, Cosmo Energy, Mitsui Oil Exploration, Marubeni, Mitsubishi,
Sumitomo, and Itochu - have foreign stakeholders, which should mean they’re under
similar scrutiny as Exxon, Chevron or Shell. But, in reality, Japan’s Foreign Exchange
and Foreign Trade Act, limits that potential pressure by preventing direct foreign
influence over decision-making in energy companies.

This leaves most market financing options open for Japan’s upstream firms. In
addition, Japanese banks have promised to continue providing the financing.
However, they have added a condition: projects should not have a negative
environmental or social impact.

So far, the banks’ vague stipulation has been met with equally general proposals to
clean up the industry. Most of them seem to propose either deploying carbon offset
credits or carbon capture storage and utilization (CCUS).

For example, in the last year Mitsubishi has supplied “carbon neutral” LNG to Toho
Gas and JAPEX, as did Mitsui to Hokkaido Gas. INPEX, JX and JAPEX are conducting
several CCUS trials around the world. And, INPEX and JAPEX are running CCUS pilot
projects in Niigata and Hokkaido in northern Japan. In comparison, U.S. upstream
counterparts have operated CCUS on a commercial basis for decades.

The problem is that neither of the two solutions are universally accepted as “green”.
And as the force of the international environmental lobby mobilizes, Japan and its
upstream firms will need to start showing more ambition and more creative solutions.


Once idealistic measures become the norm
When in 2002 Costa Rica became the first country to ban upstream projects it was a
sort of fairy tale unicorn that could afford to take such seemingly utopian measures
due to its small size and scant industry. For almost two decades, no one else followed
suit.

Fast forward to 2021. In January, incoming U.S. President Biden banned all new
drilling on federal land. Then in May, the International Energy Agency (IEA) proposed
a ban on all new oil and gas exploration. In July, Greenland decided to cease new oil
and gas exploration licenses, and last month, the European Union proposed to ban
fossil fuel exploration in the Arctic region.

For their part, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development said they’ll end financing of upstream oil and gas in 2022. Asian
Development Bank made a similar commitment earlier this year.

According to findings by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis,
more than 80 major banks, insurance firms and asset managers are now restricting
lending to the oil and gas industry, including drilling in the Arctic.

For now, the developments are not having a strong impact on Japan’s upstream
investments, which had focused on the Middle East, Southeast Asia and North
America. And while the EU aims to ban Arctic upstream activities, the Arctic LNG2
project, operated by Russia’s Novatek, starts production in 2023. Japanese companies
hold a 10% stake in the project.


Non-binding ban
The changing landscape is catching some Japanese government officials by surprise.
While the formation of BOGA was expected, a METI official told Japan NRG that the
IEA’s statement in May to ban upstream activities after 2021 came as a shock.

“This was an unprecedented move and has triggered reactions,” he said, though
maintaining it won’t impact Japan’s fossil energy strategy for now since it’s not
binding. “The IEA is merely presenting one of many options for achieving carbon
neutrality in 2050; the IEA is making a suggestion,” he said.

Japan, however, is bound by its Basic Energy Plan, an official manifesto to local and
international communities. The plan says 31% of the country’s primary energy supplies
in 2030 will be sourced from oil and 18% from gas.

In addition, the plan targets 50% of oil and gas imports to be sourced from Japanese-
owned projects, up from the previous goal of 40%. The 2019 ratio was 34.7%. The
METI official also clarified that Japan hasn’t officially commented on IEA’s suggestion,
thereby leaving the country leeway when it comes to new upstream investment.

“What’s important is achieving the carbon neutrality goal, rather than details of varied
approaches,” he said.

Some Japanese banks have pledged to terminate financing of new coal power plants,
but none have committed to end upstream oil and gas financing. Only in some cases
have they decided not to finance oil sands and Arctic projects that have negative
environmental and social impact.

If international scrutiny and pressure hamstring private Japanese banks in providing
project financing, the government can step in and provide the money. Toward that
goal, METI is seeking a ¥64 billion budget for upstream oil and gas for the coming
fiscal year, up 24% from the current one. While ¥64 billion is not a huge amount
considering that Japanese upstream investment totals ¥2-3 trillion annually, the 24%
hike sends a strong message that support is not waning despite global pressure for
decarbonization.

In addition, Japan is ramping up national efforts on upstream exploration at the local
level. In 2019, the country launched an exploration vessel called Tansa that analyzes

| Japan, however, is bound by its Basic Energy Plan, an official manifesto to local and |

| international communities. The plan says 31% of the country’s primary energy supplies |
| in 2030 will be sourced from oil and 18% from gas. |

| In addition, the plan targets 50% of oil and gas imports to be sourced from Japanese- |

| owned projects, up from the previous goal of 40%. The 2019 ratio was 34.7%. The |
| METI official also clarified that Japan hasn’t officially commented on IEA’s suggestion, |
| thereby leaving the country leeway when it comes to new upstream investment. |

| “What’s important is achieving the carbon neutrality goal, rather than details of varied |

| Some Japanese banks have pledged to terminate financing of new coal power plants, |

| decarbonization. |

| In addition, Japan is ramping up national efforts on upstream exploration at the loc |

| level. In 2019, the country launched an exploration vessel called Tansa that analyzes |

the structure of the seabed that may lead to the discovery of potential new oil and gas
fields, as well as deposits of critical mineral resources.

The survey will cover an area of 500,000 km and is expected to be completed in 2028.
The government plans to offer the prospecting data to the private sector in order to
move the launch of such projects forward.

The cost of making clean oil and gas
Of course, there is another way to read the energy events of this year. In the next year
or two the pressure on upstreamers across the globe could well ease as the public
begins to recognize that the recent spike in oil and gas prices is in large part the result
of a lack of investment in the upstream, thus leading to the current tightening of
supplies.
While the International Energy Forum reported that 2020 global capital expenditures
on oil and gas were down 34% YoY, a closer look at the data reveals that in the first
half of 2021, the number of oil and gas deals were up about 70%, but deal values
were down 51%. Projects may have become cheaper, but decarbonization costs are
inflating overall expenditures.

If there’s no additional upstream investment then by 2030 global oil production will
drop 50%, to 40 million barrels/day from the present 80 million barrels/day, according
to Boston Consulting Group.

In this context, both policy makers and captains of industry in Tokyo are naturally very
concerned. Maintaining a stable and sufficient energy supply has long been one of
the key aims of Japanese governments over the past century. If push comes to shove,
Tokyo will easily choose energy security over international decarbonization goals that
might lead to unpredictable consequences.

Japan Automakers Plan Global Charge in EVs
Via Lithium Battery Investments in India

Tesla and Chinese automakers have built a commanding lead in the electric vehicle
market, but Japan’s firms are already plotting their comeback, and it lies via India.

By the end of this year, Suzuki Motor, Toshiba and Denso hope to begin commercial
output at India’s first lithium-ion battery plant with an eye of later launching local
production of EVs for the domestic market and export. Trial production started in late
August.

This Japan-India cooperation goes beyond simply manufacturing a new type of
vehicle. The investment is part of a wider strategy to work together in battery R&D,
and includes building a supply chain for battery raw materials. It also plays into the
broader role Japan seeks to play in India’s energy transition, from assisting in coal-to-
gas switching and renewables to projects in energy efficiency and other clean tech.

The joint focus on EVs is also drawing in other partners such as Brazil, which can offer
access to some of the battery raw materials and associated technologies, as well as a
large consumer market.


Building bridges
Closer ties between India and Japan emerged over the last decade in part thanks to
former Prime Minister Abe’s belief in the geopolitical alliance between the two as a
way to counter China’s growing influence. The two nations formed an energy
dialogue, which became almost an annual meeting between ministers, working
groups and academics, as well as industry representatives.

In fiscal year 2020-21, Japanese investment in India was $2.3 billion, the fifth largest
foreign injection. India is also the biggest recipient of Japan’s official development
assistance (ODA), with $2.7 billion in 2019, more than double that of the next country,
according to the Donor Tracker initiative.

From the Japan-India Energy Dialogue meetings emerged a plan to build a test
facility for Li-on batteries and then expand that to a commercial venture. Construction
of that first commercial facility started in 2017. Then PM Abe and his India counterpart
Narendra Modi attended the cornerstone ceremony and vowed to bolster
cooperation in zero-emission vehicles.

The $700 million plant, in Gujarat state, at the Hansalpur campus, is due to finish
construction and start commercial production of Li-on batteries for EVs and hybrids by
the end of this year. The facility is owned by TDS (Toshiba Denso Suzuki) Lithium-Ion
Battery Gujarat Private Limited.

Suzuki, which has operated in India for 37 years and which owns a controlling stake in
the country’s largest automaker, Suzuki Maruti, owns 50% of the battery venture.
Toshiba holds another 40% and Denso the rest. Toshiba contributes through its

24

expertise in battery cell technology; Denso with its experience in modules and
battery-monitoring integrated circuits; while Suzuki is in charge of manufacturing
processes. The Gujarat state government acts as the local partner.

The batteries from the JV will be introduced into Suzuki India’s electric two-wheelers,
and by the middle of the decade EVs models developed for the local market. The
partners target an output of 30 million Li-ion batteries annually by 2025, the
equivalent of 1 GWh capacity.


Finding a way back into competition
For Toshiba, in particular, the India market offers a route back into global competition
in batteries. The company has sold rechargeable lithium-ion batteries since 2008, but
like most of its domestic peers lost pace in the EV transition and market share to
Chinese and South Korean rivals.

In January 2021, however, Toshiba opened a $144 million rechargeable lithium-ion
batteries manufacturing facility in Yokohama. The company has also partnered with
trading house Sojitz and Brazil’s CBMM in order to commercialize next generation Li-
on batteries that utilize niobium titanium oxide (NTO) as the anode material. NTO has
double the energy density of regular Li-on batteries, which typically rely on graphite.

Toshiba hopes that its new JV in Gujarat and the work with CBMM will bring sales in
major markets of India and Brazil, while kickstarting its re-emergence as a top player in
the clean energy space. Global production of Li-on batteries alone is projected to
more than double over the next five years.

Tesla is currently the market leader in EV batteries, with a capacity to produce about
half a million battery packs per year at its Gigafactory in Nevada, U.S. China
dominates the rest of the market, with contributions from India and Japan at a low
base.

However, as India’s auto market grows, Japan is betting that together with allies it
could challenge Chinese dominance. In 2018, India overtook Germany as the world’s
fourth-largest car market.

Meanwhile, India’s government said last month that it aims to have EV sales account
for 30% of private cars, 70% of commercial vehicles and 80% of the two- and three-
wheelers by 2030, citing an immediate need to decarbonize the transport sector.
More Japanese firms are likely to follow in the footsteps of the Suzuki-Toshiba-Denso
venture.

This summer, Nissan Motor revealed it started a feasibility study to build a Gigafactory
for EV batteries in India. The company wants to announce a new EV roadmap for India
in the near future and a local battery production hub may be part of that, according to
a local executive.

As part of the pitch to Japanese firms, India also stressed its interest in helping build
supply and processing raw materials for clean energy technology, according to a
report last year that was backed by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce
and Industry and posted by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Diversity of commodity supply is a growing issue for both countries, with China the
dominant provider of several core raw materials, such as certain rare earth metals.


Conclusion
One battery manufacturing facility will not challenge China’s top position in the EV
and adjacent markets, but it does show how Japan is building alliances on a
commercial and geopolitical level to strengthen its energy technology credentials.

The potential to grow this cooperation in batteries into full-scale EV production and
export could also help fuel progress in power storage, which is an area where both
Indian and Japanese governments want to see further development before
committing more strongly to a transition away from burning fossil fuels for electricity.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Azerbaijan/ Renewables
Azeri Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov and Qatar’s Nebras Power CEO Khalid
Mohammed Jolo met in Baku to discuss renewable energy projects in Azerbaijan.
Among the topics discussed, Azerbaijan and Qatar said they hope to cooperate in
wind energy, especially offshore projects.

Chile/ Solar power
Chile plans a 15,000 km underwater cable to send energy to China, utilizing its
cloudless Atacama Desert along the Pacific coast to source solar power. The
generated electricity would be shipped during Chile’s day, which is China’s night; and
would be highly useful when summer in Chile, which is winter in China.

Europe/ Carbon prices
Carbon prices rose to a record high, above €69 a ton on forecasts that COP26 will
lead to more active markets for emissions. The EU Emissions Trading System, which
sets the price for emitting 1 ton of carbon, finished the week at €69.1 a ton, more than
double the price of carbon at the year’s start.

Fossil fuels
CEO Jeremy Weir of trading house Trafigura, which each day handles about 6.4
million barrels of crude oil and products, said decarbonization can’t happen at the
“flick of a switch” and oil will be needed for some time to come. Weir added that
Trafigura will continue to trade coal because emerging nations need this fuel.

Germany/ Wind-to-hydrogen
Eight more companies joined the AquaVentus consortium to develop a 10 GW
offshore wind-to-hydrogen project. Membership is now 79, including Japanese utility
J-Power and Hitachi ABB Power (recently rebranded as Hitachi Energy). The wind
turbines will be installed in the North Sea by 2025. A pipeline will transport about 1
million tons of green hydrogen to mainland Germany starting in 2035.

Germany/ Gas
Certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was temporarily suspended by the state
energy regulator, igniting a rise in European gas prices. The regulator said approval
wasn’t yet possible because the pipeline owners, led by Kremlin-controlled Gazprom,
had set up a German subsidiary that wasn’t properly incorporated.

Hydrogen fuel cells
Motor vehicle parts supplier Bosch is betting on hydrogen fuel trucks. From 2021 to
2024, the company will invest €1 billion into hydrogen fuel cell technology. The EU
green hydrogen market is estimated to grow 65 percent annually through the end of
the decade, by which time it will be worth over £34 billion.

Kazakhstan/ Oil
Lukoil inked a new deal with Kazakhstan's oil and gas giant, KazMunayGaz, to join the
Kalamkas-Sea and Khazar projects that have estimated reserves of over 2 billion
barrels of oil in shallow waters of the Caspian Sea. Shell left the $5 billion project in
2019. Lukoil has been a major player in Kazakhstan since the mid 1990s.

Netherlands/ Shell
Shell was threatened with an “exit tax” after deciding to move its residency to the UK.
The Dutch Green Party will expedite a bill to create the “exit tax” to punish
companies leaving for jurisdictions with more favorable tax regimes. Parliament might
debate the new tax ahead of a Shell shareholders meeting on Dec. 10.

South Korea/ Offshore wind
Norway’s Equinor and Korea East-West Power (EWP) signed an MoU to build 3 GW of
offshore wind power using new floating technology developed for Korean waters.
Together with Korea National Oil Corporation (KNOC), Equinor and EWP are already
developing the 200 MW Donghae floating offshore wind project near a Korean gas
field.

Saudi Arabia/Green hydrogen
A planned floating industrial city will run on renewable energy. This net-zero Saudi
settlement, called Oxagon, will be home to “the world’s largest green hydrogen
project”. It’ll have 7 industries including sustainable energy, autonomous mobility,
and digital manufacturing, all to be powered by renewable energy.

USA/Gasoline prices
President Biden asked the FTC to investigate major oil companies, including
ExxonMobil and Chevron, for price-gouging amid rising gasoline prices. Biden
pointed to the fact that the two “largest oil and gas companies. . .” were planning
“billions of dollars of stock buybacks and dividends”.

UK/ Energy transition
Clean energy utility SSE rejected activist hedge fund Elliott Management’s calls for a
break-up, and will instead sell minority stakes in its electricity networks to boost
investment in “net zero” infrastructure. Toward that goal the company unveiled a
£12.5 billion investment plan to support decarbonization. By 2030, SSE plans to
deliver over a quarter of the UK’s proposed 40 GW offshore wind.
