NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





METI sets standards for GX financing of private sector transition projects

(Government statement, Aug 13)
•  METI published the standards of the GX Promotion Organization for financing private sector
transition projects. They include:
•  Compliance with the Climate Transition Bond Framework;
•  Being instrumental in social deployment of new tech owned by Japanese companies, among
others;
•  Need to support projects with risks too big for private sector investments;

•  Need to have wider social impact including the use of new types of blended financing, etc;
•  Accountability of project operators.
•  CONTEXT: The GX Promotion Organization’s main mission is to drive ¥150 trillion in transition
investments not just from the govt but also from the private sector. The financing goal is not
limited to speeding up the energy transition, but also calls for increasing Japan’s industrial
competitiveness. The Organization will primarily finance domestic projects, although it doesn’t rule

out the possibility of financing overseas projects involving Japanese companies.
• TAKEAWAY: There is no clear cut definition of “Japanese-owned technology”. METI told Japan NRG that a
patent application is one way to establish proof, but a lack of patent records would not automatically disqualify
companies since the GX Promotion Organization is open to discussion.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
DBJ issues transition bonds, a first for financial institutions
(Company statement, Aug 9)
o  The Development Bank of Japan announced conditions for its 190th corporate bond, its
first transition bond. The DBJ issued Japan's first green bond in 2014.
o  ¥10 billion in bonds will be offered, with a 5-year maturity, and a coupon rate of 0.511%.
o  CONTEXT: The cumulative domestic financing for the energy transition reached about

¥1.6 trillion in December 2023. While companies have already issued transition bonds,
and the govt issued GX economic transition bonds in February, such a transition bond
issue is a first for a financial institution.

industry. For electricity, the focus will be on decarbonizing thermal power generation.
o  CONTEXT: Coal makes up more than half of Asia’s power mix.




Chubu Electric and BP advance giant CSS project in Indonesia

(Japan NRG, Aug 16)
•  Chubu Electric and BP completed a feasibility study for an international CCUS value chain based at
the Port of Nagoya and the Tangguh gas field in Indonesia, with an eye on starting operations in
2030.
•  The project aims to capture 5 to 20 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually, to be
transported and stored at Tangguh, which is Indonesia’s largest gas field and LNG facility.
•  The two companies plan 20 liquefied CO2 ships to transport the emissions. However, the business
model remains unclear as the project will largely rely on state subsidies. The firms will do a more

detailed study before making a final investment decision.
•  CONTEXT: In 2023, Chubu Electric and BP signed an MoU to explore opportunities for
decarbonization in Japan and across Asia.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Creattura advances carbon credit projects in the Southeast Asia
(Nikkei Asia, Aug 16)
o  Tokyo-based Creattura is trying to reduce methane emissions from rice paddies,

generating carbon credits.
o  Creattura intends to develop this project in the Philippines and other Southeast Asian
countries, and has to date raised $2.3 million.
o  This project will be part of Japan's Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM).
o  Creattura also plans a service using AI and satellite technology to measure emissions
reductions. It aims to increase its carbon credit trading from 400,000 tons per year to

millions by 2028.
o  CONTEXT: Methane has an atmospheric impact equal to 20 times that of CO2.
Southeast Asian countries are among the biggest emitters.

Japan’s ambiguous definition of ‘waste’ leaves firms struggling on recycling
(Nikkei, Aug 11)
•  Japanese companies are struggling to expand the recycling of materials, blaming a lack of legal
clarity on the definition of waste/ garbage.
•  As an example, Dai Nippon Printing and the Fukuoka Research Commercialization Center For

Recycling Systems cooperated for two years to develop tech to recycle pharma bottles, but
discovered that bringing it to market is difficult due to an inspection required to determine if the
bottles are a “valuable resource” or can be classified as “waste”.
•  CONTEXT: According to Mizuho Research & Technologies, Japan’s waste recycling market in the
materials industry alone is now worth ¥6 trillion; and if plastic and metal recycling accelerates, it
could expand further.

•  Experts advocate changes to regulations to specify how used items should be treated to be
classified as “valuable material”.




TEPCO PG to enter renewables power market in Vietnam’s industrial zones
(Company statement, Aug 15)
•  TEPCO Power Grid was selected to support an energy management program in Deep C Industrial
Park in Hai Phong city in north Vietnam.
•  TEPCO PG will focus on projects related to renewables, demand response, green hydrogen
production, battery storage systems and energy management.

•  The project is part of METI’s efforts to boost economic cooperation between Japan and the Global
South.
•  TEPCO PG owns a 50% stake in Deep C Green Energy, which is working with several Japanese
firms to develop more reliable renewable power sources.
•  This is TEPCO PG’s first investment in a power distribution project outside of Japan.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Sumitomo to supply power for its Vietnam smart city
(Nikkei, Aug 17)
o  Sumitomo Corp will partially power its smart city under development in Hanoi by tapping
solar and biomass power generation facilities in a nearby industrial park to cover 30% to
40% of electricity needs.
o  The smart city is developed with Vietnamese real estate developer BRG Group.
Construction begins in 2025, with residents moving in from 2026.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: PM Kishida had planned to attend the summit with leaders of Central Asian countries
this week, but the trip was cancelled as the threat of a major earthquake loomed. This MoU is
Japan’s first energy-related development financing scheme in Central Asia.
• TAKEAWAY: JBIC and DBK will unlikely develop projects from scratch, but Japanese companies that plan to
transfer climate tech will make proposals. If both banks approve, then there’ll be separate MoUs among the

project stakeholders and the banks.

Erex sees ¥1.7 bln in Q1 profits, recovering from FY2023

(Denki Shimbun, Aug 15)
•  In Q1 FY2024, power trader and biomass plant operator Erex posted a profit of ¥1.7 billion. This is
a sharp recovery in the firm’s electricity retail business. FY2023 was difficult due to high
procurement costs.
•  The company changed its procurement strategy by shifting from securing long-term energy
contracts to a more flexible approach. It now purchases energy in line with retail sales needs at
appropriate prices.
•  The firm also strengthened coordination between retail and market trading departments. It now

offers fixed-price plans backed by electricity futures.
•  Erex is also expanding renewable energy projects overseas, such as a biomass power plant in
Vietnam that’s set to launch in December.




Toyota to test hydrogen-powered trucks in Europe for carbon neutrality
(Newswitch, Aug 14)
•  Starting mid-September, Toyota will conduct a demo of large, hydrogen-powered trucks in

•  Toyota will provide FC trucks equipped with modules that generate electricity by reacting
hydrogen with oxygen.
•  Air Liquide will supply hydrogen produced from renewables, allowing for the testing of both
vehicles and infrastructure.
•  CONTEXT: Heavy cargo transport using large trucks accounts for about a quarter of Europe's

freight transport. Switching commercial trucks to hydrogen fuel would support the need to build
hydrogen fueling stations and other infrastructure. Toyota has been developing FC technology for
large trucks since at least 2019.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mizuho to develop hydrogen transportation simulation model
(Company statement, Aug 13
o  In cooperation with the Hydrogen Value Chain Promotion Council, NEDO selected

Mizuho Research & Technologies to develop a competitive hydrogen supply chain.
o  The project will study how to create a simulation to model domestic hydrogen
transportation costs, which is key to the rollout of supply chains.
o  The study will share findings with companies involved in domestic supply chains and
gather feedback to refine the future simulation model.
o  CONTEXT: In May, Mizuho committed to providing ¥2 trillion for the production of

hydrogen, ammonia and e-methane by 2030, including for setting up supply chains.



Idemitsu and Swiss partner allocate venture capital for clean tech, materials startups

(Company statement, Aug 9)
•  Oil refining major Idemitsu Kosan has formed a partnership with Swiss materials and cleantech
capital firm, Emerald Technology Ventures, to invest in startups in renewable energy and new
materials.
•  Through 2026, Idemitsu has allocated $56 million for venture investing. It also recently created a
dedicated team to oversee venture investing, with two people in Switzerland and one in the U.S.
•  CONTEXT: Idemitsu formerly invested in a fund managed by Emerald that invested in startups in

Europe and the U.S.

TEPCO inks agreement with Palau to support energy transition
(Company statement, Aug 13)
•  TEPCO signed an agreement on technical cooperation with the Republic of Palau to provide
qualified personnel and conduct a joint project to optimize power grid management with the

installation of renewables.
•  The deal is in line with the Joint Action Plan drafted in July during the 10th Pacific Islands Leaders
Meeting that called for more cooperation in clean energy to curb diesel dependence and to
improve infrastructure.
•  CONTEXT: Palau's leader visited Fukushima Daiichi NPP in June 2023, the first head of state to do
so.
• TAKEAWAY: Palau's support for Japan's planned release of treated water from Fukushima can be seen as a

political alignment. Palau has diplomatic relations with Taiwan and has strong ties with the U.S., which provides
security guarantees and economic help. Thus, by supporting TEPCO's treated water release, Palau distances
itself from China, which has been opposing TEPCO's plan and tried to convince other Pacific nations to
oppose it as well.




MoE seeks public input on bird protection in Aomori, Tottori and Okinawa

(Government statement, Aug 16)

Nuclear power plants react to Nankai Trough earthquake warning, implement measures

(Nikkei, Aug 8)
•  The Japan Meteorological Agency issued an alert about the Nankai Trough, warning of a possible
‘mega-sized’ earthquake that’s forecast to occur off the southern coast of central Japan at some
point in the coming decades.
•  Infrastructure companies are preparing in those regions that are expected to be impacted.
•  KEPCO set up an "Emergency Disaster Countermeasures HQ" to coordinate with its nuclear and
thermal power plants.

•  Chubu Electric set up a "Contact Office" to centralize information, and it also inspected power
plant facilities and hazardous materials sites.
•  CONTEXT: This decision follows the earthquake on Aug 8 in the Hyuganada region that measured
7.1.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JERA enacts new measures after Nankai Trough warning

(Company statement, Aug 9)
o  JERA issued emergency measures and strengthened communication systems following
the Nankai Trough warning.
o  Workers were told to review safety measures in case of a disaster, such as communication
protocols for fuel transport ships and emergency departure.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kyushu Electric sets up emergency disaster response HQ

(Company statement, Aug 10)
o  Kyushu Electric and Kyushu Electric Power Transmission and Distribution set up an
Emergency Disaster Response Headquarters.
o  The utility also set up a Nankai Trough Earthquake Countermeasures HQ.
• TAKEAWAY: The official alert for the so-called megaquake was lifted on Aug 15 after no additional seismic
activity was detected. However, the authorities were clearly keen to raise public awareness of such a potential

natural disaster, and laws on the matter suggest that they had a duty to do so. Still, preparing for a quake that
scientists say occurs every couple of centuries is far from straightforward. For now, the nuclear plant operators
have tried to show that they are on alert and diligently checking all systems and processes. But the fact of the
alert may spook public opinion that has recently tended to favor nuclear energy returning as a bigger part of
the energy mix.

Agreement inked for interim spent nuclear fuel storage facility
(Various media, Aug 9)
•  A new agreement on safety was signed for the interim spent nuclear fuel storage facility in Mutsu
City, set to launch next month.
•  The agreement stipulates a 50-year storage period for spent fuel, with an initial storage capacity of

3,000 tons. A second 2,000-ton storage area is also planned.
•  A supplementary agreement was signed to ensure that spent fuel will be removed from the facility
in case of complications at the interim storage.




TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi NPP leaks 25 tons of water
(Nikkei, Aug 13)
•  About 25 tons of water leaked inside the Unit 2 building at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi NPP, and it
may have mixed with contaminated water in the basement floor.
•  On Aug 9, it was detected that the water level in the skimmer surge tank had dropped. TEPCO

said that no contaminated water leaked outside the building.
•  TEPCO plans to deploy a robot to measure radiation levels and investigate the leak’s exact source
and cause.




Itochu to increase solar power capacity and other renewables in the U.S.
(Nikkei, Aug 10)
•  Itochu will increase its solar and other renewable power generation in the U.S., aiming to build a
total capacity of 10 GW.

•  Currently, the company has 27 solar power plants under development in the U.S., but that number
is expected to increase along with construction of wind farms.
•  Itochu plans to increase investment for land acquisition and power plant construction from ¥800
billion to ¥2 trillion.
•  The firm launched its first fund for renewables in the U.S. in 2023, and will increase the investment
amount to $500 million by September.
•  CONTEXT: The U.S. offers subsidies and tax breaks for investments in renewables via the Inflation

Reduction Act that passed in August 2022. Other Japanese firms are also increasing investments in
renewables in the U.S., with Mitsubishi Corp set to double its solar power generation capacity to
just over 1 GW by late 2025.




July power spot trading volumes rise 19% amid record heat; avg price up 30%
(Exchange data, Japan NRG, Aug 15)
•  July’s average daily contracted volume in the spot market (JEPX) rose 19% from the previous
month to hit 762.7 GWh (monthly total: 23.6 TWh).

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Bids to buy electricity were up for the third straight month as the country recorded its hottest July
on record.
•  Average daily electricity demand across Japan's nine regions increased 23.3% from the previous
month and 3% YoY.
•  July’s 24-hour (system) price daily close was in the range of ¥10.5/ kWh to ¥18.8. The monthly

average was ¥14.15, up almost 30% from the previous month’s ¥10.92.
•  The July average price was the highest since November 2023.
•  Tokyo prices were the highest, while Kyushu and Shikoku regions had the lowest.




EEX sees surge in power futures trading in early August
(Japan NRG, Aug 16)
•  After a 3.4 times YoY growth in the volume of electricity traded in the first half of this year, the EEX
continues to grow.
•  The exchange said that EEX had processed 2.297 TWh of electricity trades in just five days during

the second week of August.
•  This was a record volume for one week, despite the onset of the Obon holiday period. The surge
in trading was attributed to high temperatures, concerns about supply disruptions due to two
recent earthquakes and a national ‘megaquake’ alert, as well as rising natural gas prices in Europe.
•  CONTEXT: Futures are used as a risk-hedging instrument to protect buyers against surges in the
price of the underlying commodity – in this case, electricity. In Japan, power futures are about a
quarter of physical spot sales, but in mature electricity markets the size of derivatives trading is

often much bigger than the spot market.
•  First-half 2024 volumes reached 28.9 TWh, compared with 8.6 TWh in the same period a year
earlier and surpassing the 2023 annual total of 18.3 TWh.
•  EEX has 80 companies registered as trading counterparties.
•  So far, the record monthly volume was in February 2024 with 6.6 TWh. In June, the number of
trades executed inside a month surpassed 1,000 for the first time and that number grew again in

July to a record. The products most actively sold on the EEX are the quarterly and monthly futures
contracts.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kansai Electric subsidiary to join EEX for power futures trading
(Nikkei, Aug 13)
o  Kansai Electric plans to enter the electricity futures market by late 2024 to hedge against
price fluctuation risks at retailer subsidiary, Kenes.

o  Kenes will register as a trading counterparty on the EEX, Japan’s dominant platform for
these derivatives. Kenes procures electricity from the spot (JEPX) market.
o  CONTEXT: KEPCO Energy Solution has been trading futures on TOCOM since 2021, but
decided to join EEX to prevent losses caused by price fluctuations due to changing

JOGMEC  completes test to extract gas from methane hydrate layers in Alaska
(Company statement, Aug 13)
•  JOGMEC, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology

Laboratory, completed a 10-month gas production test from methane hydrate layers in Alaska.
•  This was the first case of extracting gas from methane hydrate and using it as an energy source,
said JOGMEC.
•  The test provided critical data on long-term production and the challenges associated with
commercializing methane hydrates as a source of fuel.
•  CONTEXT: Methane hydrate is formed when methane gas and water combine under specific

conditions of low temperature and high pressure to form an ice-like solid.
•  JOGMEC plans to analyze the data and apply the findings to future offshore production tests and
commercialization efforts in Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has small amounts of oil and gas resources on land, and imports most of its needs in those
fuels. But, the existence of methane hydrate has been confirmed in the seabed in Japan’s waters. Several tests
have been made in areas with the most potential, such as around the Daini–Atsumi Knoll. However, starting
production from an element that has not traditionally been utilized as a source of hydrocarbon is tricky, and

the fact that these sites are offshore makes the technical/ engineering challenges even greater. As such, Japan
is trying to advance carefully, including by testing production approaches in similar conditions. When (or even
whether) these advances will lead to commercial-scale methane production is unclear.




LNG stocks up 3.7% over last week, and up 15% YoY

(Government data, Aug 14)
•  LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 1.98 million tons as of Aug 11, up 3.7% from the previous
week (1.91 million tons); up 15.2% from end August 2023 (1.72 million tons); and down 2% over
the past five-year average of 2.02 million tons.
•  CONTEXT: Typhoon #7 passed through Kanto on Aug 16-17, bringing a lot of heavy rain but less
damage than anticipated. Still, the Japan Coast Guard asked large vessels in the Yokohama Port
area to evacuate outside of Tokyo Bay. Bullet trains and local trains stopped or reduced

operations. Once a typhoon passes, temperatures quickly rise again.

ANALYSIS

BY YURIY HUMBER

Japan’s Decarbonization Drive Seeks New Impetus via
Hydrogen and Batteries

With Japan facing the prospect of a new prime minister later next month, the
successor to Kishida Fumio will face a barrage of social and economic issues. The new
PM will also play a major role in Japan’s energy planning with a number of key policy
documents due inside the next six to seven months.

Kishida’s successor will preside over:
•  Japan’s participation in the latest United Nations Climate Change
Conference, the COP29 in Azerbaijan (November);
•  Formation of a new roadmap that will seek to align industrial and clean
energy developments (GX 2.0) (year-end);
•  Update to the strategic Basic Energy Policy, which will outline focus areas
through 2035 (latest, March 2025);
•  Revision of Japan’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which will set

new and stricter targets on emission reductions (expected Feb or March
2025).

There are many other sector-specific developments that may be influenced by a new
face in the PM’s office, but just as Kishida continued many of the policies of his
predecessor, while rebranding the net-zero commitments as ‘GX’ (green
transformation), the next PM is unlikely to significantly alter course in the near future.

To get a sense of the state of affairs that Kishida’s successor will inherit, here is an
outline of the status of the energy landscape in Japan today. The slides are based on
developments covered in the Japan NRG Weekly reports and a presentation delivered
to the American Chamber of Commerce, Japan (ACCJ) last month.

Preface
Energy policymaking faces at least three major challenges, often described as the
energy trilemma: balancing between decarbonization, economic stability, and
security. The trilemma could also be depicted as the “three-body problem”, in which
each of the three (or more) issues exerts gravitational pull on the actor (national
government/ corporation). Those actors that veer too closely to one of the ‘bodies’,
thus losing touch with the others, often goes through turmoil. The challenge is to
retain a stable course between the ‘bodies’. Nations that do this best are most likely
to execute a successful energy transition, which requires multi-decade efforts.

Japan-specific trilemmas
Japan is attempting to thread the needle on several fronts and placate several
stakeholders at once. Traditionally, it has sought to create a consensus that helped
policy and industry move in lockstep. However, today’s more global and diversified
energy markets are testing the ability of Tokyo bureaucrats to manage multi-
stakeholder relations across many regions.

And yet, keeping the status quo is also not an option. The macro-economic
environment is telling the government that it must bring down the cost of energy
imports or increase the value of Japan’s industrial output. It will be hard to achieve the
latter in the energy sector if Japan champions only the clean technologies widely
utilized today (i.e., PV solar panels, fixed-bottom wind turbines, etc.) Thus,
policymakers and domestic industry are reviewing other clean energy pathways.
















Revival of Industrial output … via chips
To make the economy balanced, Japan has decided to pour state subsidies into
boosting its industrial output and aggressively revive a flagging semiconductor sector.
This should secure additional export revenue (and geopolitical status), but it will come
at a considerable energy cost. Semiconductor fabrication plants require lots of power,
18

as do data centers, another focal point of Japan’s digital-heavy industrial strategy.
Belatedly, the government has realized that the industrial jump-start will quash earlier
assumptions of energy demand decline in Japan over the course of this decade. It
also requires a more careful consideration of where inside Japan the industrial output
will take place in order to align with clean energy growth. Kyushu’s electricity demand,
for example, is already up this year and the most likely reason is the opening of a local
plant by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation.

















Another thing to keep in mind is that the push into Generative AI, which Japan is also
embracing, will further drive energy demand. Several researchers have demonstrated
that an AI-powered online search utilizes 10-15 times more electricity than a regular
online query.


Main developments in policy
As a result, the government is trying to synchronize updates of the Basic Energy Plan
and industrial strategies. Other policy momentum is in hydrogen, CCS, and critical raw
materials.

What is keeping Japanese experts up at night? Here is a summary of recent
discussions:


















Policy mismatch with energy sector developments
One reason for the sudden activity in updating various policy documents is that on-
the-ground realities are not following the government’s policy plans of recent years.

These are some of the assumptions in the current Basic Energy Plan:
















So, we should be seeing a strong uptick in new solar capacity. Instead, the total is
starting to drop. Below, on the left is a chart showing total additions, and on the right
the capacity based on FIT/ FIP approvals.







20

Source: METI

Of course, FIT/ FIP no longer make up the entire solar market, but they are a useful
indicator.

In the last two-three years, a booming market in PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements)
has developed in Japan, and this is likely just the beginning. This makes for an
interesting juncture, as the ‘paymaster’ for new solar shifts from the general consumer
to the business / industrial user. This will allow large energy buyers to have a greater
influence on what new power generation sources get built. U.S. tech giants such as
Amazon and Google will have a stronger voice in Japan’s energy policies than before.














New solar?
As mentioned earlier, from the government’s point of view it’s not just an energy
policy issue – it’s an industrial issue. So, Japan favors promotion of next-generation
21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

solar tech, such as Perovskite solar cells (PSC) over support for sales of existing (99%-
Chinese manufactured) solar panels. There are plenty of industrial users that are
excited about the potential for this kind of flexible film-like solar devices, but the
technology may not be ready for market just yet due to lower efficiency versus
polysilicon panels and other issues.

















OFFSHORE WIND
There is brighter news in the offshore wind sector. Here, too, Japan’s focus is on
trying to leapfrog industrial development and secure a foothold in floating turbines,
rather than building projects quickly based on current technologies. But there are
other bottlenecks for the country to navigate in the offshore wind space.


















Over to hydrogen
The struggles above in the solar and wind sector partly aim to show why so much
hope is now placed on the development of an ammonia-fired (or hydrogen-fired)
power sector. For Japan, hydrogen as a fuel in the power sector works thematically for
several reasons:


22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The details may change over time, but this is what the provisional timeline on
ammonia and hydrogen may look like:
















This would create massive demand for ammonia as a fuel in just a few years. The start
of commercial-scale operations at just one unit of a thermal power plant operated by
JERA, as planned for FY2027, will boost demand several fold.










That is only the beginning, however, with several other major utilities committing to
trialing co-firing and exploring options in ammonia and hydrogen generation.
Chemical companies are another demand center looking to switch earlier rather than
later, which could easily push Japan’s consumption above the 2030 national target of
3 million tons of hydrogen (assuming the cost issues are resolved).
23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Missing pieces: balanced power markets and energy storage
Whether it be the renewables sector or ammonia-fired generation, new development
needs funding and state subsidies are far from limitless, especially in light of the
macro-economic troubles outlined at the start of this presentation. This makes it
imperative to develop a more efficient private financing model for new power capacity
– one that would encourage banks to lend outside of state-guaranteed business
models.

The other bottleneck for decarbonization in Japan, and especially for the rollout of
more solar and wind capacity, is a relative dearth of energy story options outside of
pumped hydro plants. Without this, balancing the power grid will be ever more
difficult and curtailments will be rife. That’s why so many of the recent state auctions
and power market schemes have focused on promoting the construction of new
batteries / BESS and other energy storage facilities.



















After all, energy storage is pretty much the same as energy security, and Japan is not
as secure on this front as many imagine.

Conclusions
The energy landscape in Japan today isn’t without its challenges, but therein lie the
business opportunities. Not all the trends active today will last. One that appears in
most danger of constraint is the Generative AI revolution due to limited energy
resources. Another trend that seems unlikely to survive is the expectation for energy
prices to decrease. Geopolitics, higher data use, the need to fund energy transition
projects and many other reasons point to an up arrow on prices mid to long term.
Countries that are able to win a general acceptance from the public on this point will
likely move forward in the energy transition. But expect plenty of chaotic moments on
the journey to decarbonization. The sudden announcement of PM Kishida’s decision
to step down is just one of the many incidents to come.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Nuclear power
Rising consumer energy prices have dampened enthusiasm for Labor’s renewables
agenda and opened the door for nuclear as an alternative. Opposition Liberals have
pledged to abandon the 2030 renewables target and scrap large-scale wind farm
projects. They say nuclear energy could deliver power from the middle of next
decade.

China / Natural gas
In 2023, 7%, or 2.6 Bcf/d, more natural gas was consumed than in 2022, after a
decline of 1.1% in 2022 when economic growth was slower due to COVID policies. In
2023, China’s natural gas imports averaged 16 Bcf/d and accounted for 42% of total
supplies, compared with 15% in 2010. Natural gas is imported into China by pipeline
and LNG.

China / Solar power
Solar company Tongwei plans to buy a 51% stake in competitor Runergy for about
$700 million, allowing the Chinese company to gain a presence in the U.S. In
Alabama, Runergy is building a 5 GW solar module plant.

India / Energy transition
The share of coal-based plants in India’s power generation is seen to decrease to
around 67% by FY2026 as the country further advances its renewable energy capacity,
said CRISIL Ratings.

Indonesia / Solar power
Implementing renewable programs and replacing coal plants with solar power
installations could create 100,000 new jobs, claims energy think tank Ember.

Jet fuel and Oil
Global jet fuel demand will soften due to a slowdown in consumer spending, which
could weigh on oil prices in the months ahead. Global oil demand has not met
expectations in the first half of 2024 due to weaker-than-forecast consumption in the
U.S. and China.

Laos / Renewable energy
Laos inked a deal with China General Nuclear for a renewable energy base in the
country's northern region. This adds a second phase of the project that will include a
580 MW wind and solar plant in Luang Namtha province and a 420 MW solar plant in
Oudomxay province. It follows on an initial agreement signed by the two sides last
September to build a renewable energy base in the north of the country.

Philippines / Renewable energy
Ayala Group firm ACEN has an ambitious target of 20 GW of renewable energy by
2030. ACEN has a pipeline – by 2030, 40% of its capacity will be in the Philippines,
