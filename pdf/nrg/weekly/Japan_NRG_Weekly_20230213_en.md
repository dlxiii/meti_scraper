NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY






Cabinet approves GX Basic Policy; Nuclear power to make a comeback

(Government Statement, Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan NRG, Feb. 10)
•  The Cabinet approved the GX (Green Transformation) Basic Policy. This leaves the Diet to approve
necessary law amendments as the main administrative step before the legal side of the strategy is
cemented. It should come into force from April 2024.
•  New amendments for older reactors and extension of the operation period will be implemented
separately in a period not exceeding two years after these rules take effect.
•  According to METI, the GX strategy focuses on two areas: boosting the use of CO2-free electricity
from renewables and nuclear, and also introducing carbon pricing and the sale of a new type of

bond as a way to help fund decarbonization.
•  CONTEXT: The strategy greatly alters Japan’s nuclear policy. Previously, the government said it
neither intends to build new NPPs, nor replace old NPPs. The GX policy states that next-gen
reactors will be built on the site of aging units due for decommissioning.
•  GX strategy also covers the issues of nuclear decommissioning and the construction of an
undersea cable between Hokkaido and Honshu islands to facilitate the development of offshore
wind projects in northeast Japan.

• TAKEAWAY: Nearly 12 years after the Fukushima accident, Japan has finally decided to fully restart its nuclear
industry. As many engineers have changed professions or retired, however, the challenge now is how to find a
new generation of qualified personnel.
• While many focuses on the nuclear sector developments, we expect GX to have an even greater impact on

fund-raising and investments for clean energy projects, especially in offshore wind, carbon capture, energy
management, and carbon recycling areas.




METI to rewrite plan for carbon neutral city gas; synthetic methane falls from favor
(Japan NRG, Feb. 8)
•  METI will rewrite its plan for decarbonizing the city gas sector, decreasing the role of synthetic
methane that was expected to replace 1% of city gas supplies by 2030, and 90% by 2050. These
targets were originally set in the 2021 Basic Energy Plan and the Cabinet Clean Energy Strategy.
•  METI proposes diversifying the approach to decarbonization that will include: 1) synthetic

methane; 2) biogas/biomethane; 3) hydrogen; 4) LNG and CCUS; and 5) LNG and carbon offsets.
•  In June, METI will publish an interim report on this strategy.
•  CONTEXT: METI prefers having various options to choose from and then to pursue the best
combination; this might open opportunities for companies exploring technologies that compete
with synthetic methane.
• TAKEAWAY: This is a big move after the fanfare with which METI and industry players launched the “synthetic

methane” rebranding as “e-methane” in the fall of 2022. It’s possible that the cooling of expectations for the

4


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

sector came after hard-nosed calculations were done about the volumes and costs involved in meeting the
2030 targets.

• Now, the ministry plans to set up an expert panel to draft new GHG accounting standards for city gas utilities
that would allow the use of credits to calculate the carbon emission factor. But this does raise the question:
should credits be used to cut down on Scope 1 emissions?
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI to consider making a new international offset credit system for industrialized nations
(Japan NRG, Feb. 8)
o  METI will study the potential for a new international carbon offset credit transfer system,
mainly to allow the participation of industrialized nations.
o  The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) was originally designed to support green initiatives
in developing countries. Currently, hydrogen and synthetic methane projects planned in
North America and Australia are not applicable.

o  The study is a part of METI’s effort to rewrite decarbonization plans for the gas sector.
o  The new system will be useful for the transfer of credits of CCS and ammonia projects.
• TAKEAWAY: There are two approaches to realize credit transfer in industrialized nations: by expanding JCM to
include them, or by establishing a new system similar but separate from JCM. METI appears to favor the latter
approach.



Village mayors in Ohma NPP vicinity ask METI to promote the project
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 8)
•  The village mayors of Ohma, Sai and Kazama-ura, all in Aomori Prefecture, visited METI on Feb 7
to ask to promote construction of the Ohma NPP, a project that was frozen in the wake of the 2011

Fukushima accident.
•  Ohma NPP is the first nuclear generation project for Electric Power Development Co. (J-Power).
Building began in May 2008, but stopped in March 2011. Now, a possible resumption of
construction is under review by the NRA.
• TAKEAWAY: The resumption of construction would be a major topic in itself and likely not an easy engineering
feat. However, there are other points of interest at Ohma. The NPP would be the first in the world built to run
on 100% mixed oxide fuel (MOX), which is manufactured from recycled nuclear fuel. MOX mixes plutonium

recovered from used reactor fuel with depleted uranium. Ohma was originally slated to start operation in July
2010, but the project has been in limbo ever since 2011.




IHI shares details of world’s first e-methane powered bus project
(Japan NRG, Feb. 6)
•  IHI shared with Japan NRG details of the world's first buses that will run on e-methane, which is a
synthetic methane produced from captured CO2 and green hydrogen.
•  IHI’s solar power plant will provide the energy required to produce hydrogen, while it will purchase
CO2 from third parties.
•  The buses can run for 150 km on a single tank of e-methane, which is in gas form.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  E-methane may contain excess hydrogen, so extra processing is required to cut the hydrogen
content to less than 2%, a requirement for it to be uses as vehicle fuel.
•  CONTEXT: The buses started to run on Feb 1 in Soma City in Fukushima Prefecture. The goal is to
show that synthetic methane can replace fossil-gas vehicle fuel. IHI also aims to find a way to
control costs of power and green hydrogen production in Japan.

• TAKEAWAY: Japanese companies look overseas for hydrogen projects because domestic production is
believed to be nearly impossible due to high costs of renewable power. IHI will verify if the use of surplus
electricity from renewables to produce hydrogen is feasible. IHI is implementing various cost saving measures,
such as running the methanation plant under remote control to cut labor costs. Direct use of e-methane gas,
without converting it to liquid, also cuts costs.

Fossil-fuel    ¥50/ km
Hydrogen       ¥95-100/ km
E-methane      CO2 (¥3,000-¥5,000/ ton) + hydrogen + power + other running costs



Japan Wind Power Association calls for more discussions over govt tender rules

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 8)
•  The Japan Wind Power Association (JWPA) has asked the govt for further clarity on the new
offshore wind auction system around the upper limit supply price and the evaluation criteria. The
group is concerned that there is not enough understanding in the industry around how the
proposed cost of power generation (kWh) will be verified by officials.
•  JWPA said it is speaking with relevant ministries and agencies, but has so far only been briefed on
the appropriateness of new govt rules. It believes further dialog is necessary to improve the rules
even after the recent changes.

•  JWPA said it doesn’t want to make changes to the upcoming auctions (known as Round 2).
However, to improve future auctions, it said more discussion is needed around:
o  (1) upper supply ceiling price,
o  (2) escalation clause,
o  (3) application of the FIP system,
o  (4) zero-premium level of the FIP system, and
o  (5) other evaluation criteria.

•  JWPA also said that it seeks to make the discussion process more transparent.



Chubu Electric and BP start CCS study for Nagoya Port
(Kankyo Business, Nikkan Kogyo, Feb. 7)
•  Chubu Electric and BP signed an MoU for decarbonization in Japan and Asia. The two plan to

capture, store, and utilize 3 million tons of CO2 emitted from the Port of Nagoya.
•  Nagoya Port is Japan’s largest in terms of cargo volume; its target is to reduce CO2 emissions by
35% (over 2013 levels) by 2030.
•  The companies will make a final investment decision on the CCUS project by around 2026.

Mitsubishi partners with RWE and Lotte Chemical on fuel ammonia supply chain
(Company Statement, Feb. 8)
•  Trading house Mitsubishi Corporation announced a partnership with Germany's RWE and South
Korea's Lotte Chemical to establish a supply chain for fuel ammonia in Asia, Europe and the U.S.

•  The group will examine the potential for fuel ammonia production at the Port of Corpus Christi,
Texas, U.S. The idea is to produce annually as much as 10 million tons of fuel ammonia, starting in
2030.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s public-private council for the introduction of fuel ammonia has released a
roadmap that estimates the country’s import needs at 3 million tons of fuel ammonia in 2030 and
30 million tons in 2050.



Japan will push the issue of nuclear waste disposal with municipalities
(Nikkei, Feb. 10)
•  Japan hosted a ministerial group to formulate its draft revision to an existing law which regulates
the final selection of nuclear waste disposal sites.
•  The government, together with EPCOs and the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan

(NUMO), will visit over 100 municipalities to ask them to research possible sites for a final disposal
of high-level radioactive waste.
•  The draft revision says the central government will be responsible for site selection.
• TAKEAWAY: Since only two Hokkaido municipalities agreed to a final disposal site inspection, the national
government has changed the system to allow it to directly ask local governments. Under the previous system,
the sites often faced standoffs between proponents and opponents. However, as these requests will now come
from Tokyo, such standoffs will be considerably reduced.



CCS: ANRE roadmap puts a price target on cost to store 1 ton of CO2

(Gas Energy News, Feb. 6)
•  A final roadmap by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) calls for building enough
capacity to store between 6 to 12 million tons of CO2 annually by 2030.
•  It currently costs about ¥20,000 yen to isolate, recover, transport, and store a single ton of CO2.
The roadmap sets a goal to reduce this cost by over 60% by 2050.
•  It also calls for new laws, as soon as possible, to regulate carbon capture and storage.




Mitsui and MOL get approval for design of an ammonia-fueled bulk carrier
(Company Statement, Jan. 27)
•  Trading house Mitsui and shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (also known as MOL) received
approval in principle (AiP) for the design of a 210,000-ton dry bulk carrier fueled by ammonia.
•  The fuel will be switched from heavy oil to ammonia. The ship’s deck will have two ammonia fuel
tanks.

Shin Energy completes biogas power plant in Nishinomiya
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 7)
•  Shin Energy completed construction of a biogas power plant (720 kW) in Nishinomiya. Its fuel will
be produced by fermenting organic waste such as food waste. Operations start in June.

•  The plan’s electricity will be sold to Kansai Electric Power Transmission and distributed through a
FIT scheme.
•  CONTEXT: According to Shin Energy, it’s unusual to build a large biogas power plant in the city
suburbs. In addition to reducing fuel transportation costs, the plan will help with food waste
recycling.



TEPCO will help Laos with its carbon neutrality goals
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 10)
•  A consortium led by TEPCO Power Grid is formulating a comprehensive plan to make Laos carbon
neutral. The plan will be ready by May and is part of a project commissioned by the Japan
International Cooperation Agency.



Euglena supplies innovative biofuel to construction site machinery
(New Energy News, Feb. 9)
•  In January 2023, Euglena started supplying its next-gen biodiesel to SC Machinery, a 100%-
subsidiary of Shimizu Corp., to power a crane at a construction site in Shibaura.
•  CONTEXT: Euglena is promoting the use of its biodiesel, branded SUSTEO, in various kinds of
machinery and engines from cars to ferries to tractors. This is expanding the use case list while

testing the viability of the fuel.
•  The company claims that using its fuel does not emit additional CO2 because CO2 is taken from
the atmosphere to create the biodiesel in the first place.



Group to build 30 zero-emission houses with solar PVs in Saitama

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 7)
•  Kaneka, Takasago Kensetsu, TEPCO Energy Partner, TEPCO Power Grid, and the city of Saitama
set up a consortium for “Creating a carbon neutral town in Saitama” by 2030. The goal is to
achieve an “innovative and sustainable green transformation model.”
•  Kaneka, which leads the consortium, plans to build 30 zero-net energy houses (ZEH) equipped with
high efficiency, roof-top solar PVs to promote decarbonization.




Real estate developer swaps 20% of company fleet to battery EVs
(Company Statement, Feb. 7)
•  With its long-term green vision of “Challenge ZERO 2055,” Daiwa House introduced 70 BEVs as
company cars, which account for about 20% of its total fleet.
•  Daiwa also installed EV chargers in all 36 offices; this will reduce 96 tons of CO2 emissions yearly.
•  By 2026, Daiwa House intends to switch all its company cars to BEVs.

Toyota Tsusho buys control in SoftBank’s renewables unit, becoming Japan’s top RE player

(Company Statement, Feb. 9)
•  Toyota Tsusho acquired 85% of SB Energy, a subsidiary of SoftBank Group that develops
renewable energy projects. The two intend to collaborate in developing renewables assets and in
the power demand and supply adjustment business.
•  Toyota Tsusho didn’t reveal the price paid for the shares.
•  Toyota Tsusho says it will become one of Japan's largest solar players in terms of installed
capacity. It is already Japan’s biggest wind power generator via its subsidiary Eurus Energy. As of

last December, Eurus had 3,055 MW of wind capacity and 350 MW of solar capacity installed. Its
total renewables capacity was 3.7 GW.
•  SB Energy has 667.1 MW of solar and 55.9 MW of wind power capacity in Japan, as well as 50 MW
of wind power capacity in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia.
• TAKEAWAY: Toyota Group, led by the world’s biggest automaker, has committed to carbon neutrality. As
such, it needs to secure large volumes of CO2-free electricity and has moved quickly to acquire sizeable assets
in the renewables space in Japan over the last year. Toyota Tsusho, the trading house of the Toyota group,
took full control of Eurus Energy from TEPCO and has now acquired control of SoftBank’s renewables unit.
That gives Toyota Tsusho almost 4.5 GW of renewables capacity, of which solar makes up just over 1 GW.
Potentially, this makes Toyota not only the biggest player in renewables in Japan but also the top runner in the
solar space.


Power companies burn more coal; consumption up 4.4% YoY, highest since 2011

(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 7)
•  In the December quarter, Japan’s nine largest power companies used more fuel oil and coal than
they did the year before; but less crude oil and LNG.
•  Coal consumption for the quarter was up 4.4% YoY, the highest since 2011.
•  LNG consumption fell by 1.6% to its lowest level since 2011.



Kashiwazaki mayor is positive for October restart of TEPCO nuclear plant

(Broadcasting System of Niigata, Feb. 8)
•  The mayor of Kashiwazaki City, where TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP is located, said he expects
the restart of Unit 7 of the facility in October 2023.
•  In January, TEPCO hiked electricity rates due to soaring fuel prices, calculating the impact of the
Unit 7 restart.
•  The mayor said: "It’s better for Japan if the nuclear power plant, which has completed the

appropriate inspections and has been assured of safety, remains operational."
• TAKEAWAY: Since all reactors at Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP and Fukushima Dai-Ni NPP were decided to be
decommissioned, Kashiwazaki Kariwa is TEPCO’s last remaining NPP. With fuel prices rising sharply, TEPCO is

now committed more than ever to restart Kashiwazaki Kariwa as it will have a major impact on its financials.
The company recently posted its worst loss in at least a decade.



NGK and Ricoh join forces to develop VVPs
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Feb. 9)
•  NGK and electronics major Ricoh created a joint venture to develop virtual power plants (VPPs), as

well as services to monitor and predict electricity demand.
•  The company, which has been named ‘NR Power Lab’, begins operations in 2025.
•  NR CEO Nakanishi Yuichi says the company will pool the technological capabilities and know-how
of its parent companies, notably NGK’s “NAS” grid batteries and Ricoh’s blockchain solutions.


Kyushu Electric avoided electricity price hike thanks to restart of Genkai NPP unit 4

(Fukuoka Broadcasting, Feb. 9)
•  On Feb 9, Unit 4 of the Genkai NPP in Saga Prefecture restarted. It had been shut since September
in order upgrade the facilities with anti-terrorism measures.
•  Power output will gradually increase, and after a government inspection, the plant is expected to
return to normal operation in early March.
•  This means that both operable units at Genkai NPP are now online.
• TAKEAWAY: While many power companies are applying for price hikes due to soaring fuel costs, Kyushu

Electric says it can avoid a price hike thanks to stable operation of its NPPs. Also, Kansai Electric expects to
avoid a rate hike because it has five reactors in operation. Meanwhile, Hokuriku Electric wants a rate hike of
42.7%, and Okinawa Electric has applied for 39.3%. Such a wide gap in electricity prices among EPCOs has
never before been seen in Japan.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Editorial: recent announcements suggest TEPCO is struggling to stay afloat
(Diamond, Feb. 11)
o  CONTEXT: This is an opinion article by the Diamond editorial team.
o  TEPCO sought state approval to hike power bills by just under ¥3000/ month.
o  Industry insiders speculate that TEPCO only decided to keep the increase below ¥3000

for optics and to appease the government, because the increase won’t be enough to put
the utility back in the black.
o  Another telling detail is that TEPCO’s rate hike calculation is based on the assumption
that Unit 7 of its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP will restart in July. However, TEPCO reassured
residents near the plant that the reactor won’t restart until October.
o  If Unit 7 restarts in October as announced, the three months of lost revenue will further
compound TEPCO’s losses.

Tokyo Gas plans floating wind farm off Fukushima coast
(Company Statement, Feb. 3)
•  Tokyo Gas and Shinobuyama Fukushima Power filed a plan with METI to build two floating
offshore wind farms, with a total 30 MW capacity, off the Fukushima Prefecture coast, near Naraha

and Tomioka townships.
•  The wind farms will be about 16 km off the coast and will connect with Tohoku Electric’s network
via submarine cables.
•  Project details and environment assessment findings will be open to the public until March 6.
Comments and opinions will be accepted until March 20.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s first floating wind farm, the 16.8 MW Goto facility in Nagasaki prefecture, is

expected to start commercial operation in January 2024.
• TAKEAWAY: Floating wind farms are less likely to cause community conflicts as there are no fishery rights at
stake and possible noise complaints. However, since floating wind power is new, there are inconsistencies in
the regulatory framework. Marine safety regulations classify floating wind power installations as “sea vessels”,
while other regulations say they’re “structures”.




Data breach scandal worsens as TEPCO gets accused of accessing METI system
(Abema Times, Feb. 10)
•  METI said employees of TEPCO Energy Partner, the retail company of TEPCO, gained
unauthorized access to METI’s renewable energy business management system.
•  The access to METI’s business management system for renewable energy is only allowed for power

transmission companies. In this case, a TEPCO Energy Partner employee gained unauthorized
access using the TEPCO Power Grid account.
•  Viewed information included names of power generators and electricity prices.
• TAKEAWAY: Recently, an illegal access case by other EPCOs was reported, but they gained access to
information about the system inside their own group. For example, a Kansai Electric employee gained

unauthorized access to Kansai Transmission and Distribution. However, in the TEPCO case, this can be more
serious because their employee saw data from METI's system.



JERA to sell stake in one Taiwanese offshore wind project, but keep two other stakes
(Nikkei, Feb. 10)
•  JERA will sell its stake in the Formosa 3 offshore wind project, which is under construction in the

midwest part of Taiwan. JERA owns 44% of the project and the remaining 56% is owned by
Australian investment bank Macquarie Group Limited.
•  JERA also invested in two more Taiwanese offshore wind projects – Formosa 1 (128 MW) and
Formosa 2 (376 MW). JERA will hold on to those two.
•  JERA decided to pull out of Formosa 3 because building costs sharply increased due to COVID-19
and geopolitical risks between China and Taiwan.

Toshiba ESS supports solar projects to switch from FIT to FIP
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 9)
•  Toshiba Energy Systems (Toshiba ESS) will support Nippon Benex’s switch from FIT to FIP for their
three solar projects in Miyagi and Chiba prefectures.

•  Corporate off-site PPAs were concluded for three solar power plants rented on roofs in eastern
Japan that had operated under the FIT system.
•  Toshiba ESS will support the transition to FIP as an aggregator. The power generated will be
supplied to Kokusai Kogyo. The switchover will be completed in March or later.
• TAKEAWAY: While the FIT is a system to purchase renewable energy by fixed price for certain years, FIP is a
system to purchase by market price plus premium. More importantly, while solar power suppliers can sell

power to EPCOs, they need to find their customers by themselves. In view of this, Toshiba’s new service is
helpful because it won’t only allow Nippon Benex to enjoy fixed income, but also secures customers to sell to.


Yufutsu Energy begins commercial operation for 75 MW biomass power plant in Hokkaido

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 6)
•  Trading house Sojitsu Corp and Nippon Paper Industries began commercial operation of a
biomass power plant in Hokkaido.
•  The 75 MW plant is now one of Japan's largest biomass facilities.
•  The plant runs on imported wood chips and palm kernel shell (PKS) as feedstock, and makes use of
unused biomass resources in Hokkaido - such as thinned wood or forest residue. This will help to

preserve Hokkaido’s forests.


J-POWER begins demand-response in Hiroshima with 710 kW of power generation
(New Energy Business News, Feb. 8)
•  J-Power and Mizu Mirai Hiroshima will cooperate on demand-response (DR) supply of electricity in
summer and winter when electricity supply may be strained at peak hours.

•  When power demand is tight during the summer and winter peaks of FY2023, the water utility
plans to turn off pumps at its facilities. This will reduce power demand for a period of time and
create nega-watts.
•  As an aggregator, J-Power will combine the nega-watts supplied by Mizu Mirai with those supplied
separately by its own facilities and use them as a regulating power source in times of tight power
supply and demand.
•  CONTEXT: This kind of arrangement allows J-Power to avoid investing in new power capacity to

meet peak demand, saving money.


NRC rules out severe nuclear reactor accident as cause of automatic stop of Takahama unit 4
(Fukui Shimbun, Feb. 9)
•  The NRC determined the cause of an automatic stop at Takahama NPP unit 4. It was a problem

with the driving mechanism for the control rods.
•  After the reactor was stopped, the remaining 46 control rods all fell into the reactor.
•  Power output is controlled by the rods going up and down into the reactor core

•  CONTEXT: On Jan 30, Takahama unit 4 automatically shut down after an alarm warned of a
sudden decrease in the amount of neutrons in the reactor. Since this trouble is not expected to be
connected to past issues, the NRA decided to hear from KEPCO at an open meeting to determine
the cause of the trouble and measures to prevent recurrence.

METI’s Plan to Diversify Low-Carbon Fuels,

And the Future of Biofuels

As part of the national Green Transformation (GX) program, which the ruling party
chiefs approved last week, the energy transition roadmap through 2050 calls for the
development of three carbon recycling technologies: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),
synthetic fuel and synthetic methane.

More than a year earlier, however, in October 2021, METI’s Sixth Strategic Energy
Plan called for more research on how to expand use of bioethanol and biodiesel,
which are the more established low-carbon fuels growing in popularity in Europe and
the Americas.

As such, Japan’s energy policy seems to be supporting two different roadmaps for
fuel decarbonization. On the one hand, GX wants to see the development of new low-
carbon fuel tech that recycles CO2; on the other, METI is backing stronger utilization
of biofuels that are already on the international market.

The apparent contradiction could be explained by looking at what Japan can
implement now to reduce emissions this decade and what will drive the nation’s
decarbonization closer to the 2050 carbon-neutrality deadline. How the two pathways
will co-exist, however, is less clear.


Background
From Dec 23, 2022 to Jan 22, 2023, METI solicited public comments for its draft of
the Basic Policy to Implement a Green Transformation (GX). The draft law was
approved by the joint meeting with 5 LDP committees including the GX Headquarters
of PM Kishida’s party on Feb. 8.

The GX policy paper calls for the development of low-carbon technologies such as
those that can produce fuel that uses captured CO2. Over the next decade, R&D into
this technology will be supported and accompanied by a necessary legal framework.
Finally, the government plans to promote wide use of such fuels in the 2030s and
2040s, with an eye toward the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.

According to the new policy, bioethanol and biodiesel won’t play a major role in the
GX, but they clearly align with the next-generation synthetic fuels outlined in the 6th
Basic Energy Plan that was published in October 2021.

So far, METI has not clarified a detailed roadmap for existing biofuels, but has
commented that: “The role of bioethanol and biodiesel should be decided in the
future according to international trends”.

So, what is the status of biofuel development and usage in Japan today?

Pioneering carbon recycling tech
【SAF…Algae or woody biomass → Biojet fuel】
According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), SAF is defined as
renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria. ICAO
research shows that SAF has the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions for the
aviation industry.

The ICAO has called for the industry to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.
Japan’s goal by 2030 is to replace 10% of aviation fuel consumed by domestic airlines
with SAF; this amounts to 1.3 million tons of fuel.
Major Japanese aviation firms are very focused on SAF. All Nippon Airways (ANA)
plans to replace more than 10% of its fuel consumption with SAF by FY2030, and
usually only SAF by 2050. Rival Japan Airlines (JAL) set a target of using SAF for 1% of
its fuel by FY2025 and then matching ANA’s 10% by 2030.

【Synthetic Fuel…CO2+hydrogen → Liquid fuel】
Synthetic fuels can be produced by synthesizing CO2 and hydrogen, which is why
they are referred to as “artificial crude oil” or “e-fuel”. Synthetic liquid fuels have an
energy density much higher than that of fuels made from renewable energy sources
and are suitable as direct replacements for existing engines and other equipment.
They could work with internal combustion engines or oil refueling systems.

Large vehicles, vessels and aircrafts tend to struggle to travel long distances on
battery power, but could switch to synthetic fuels while maintaining many of the
operational characteristics. What’s more, synthetic fuels can be produced in larger
volumes than SAF, naturally creating separate market niches for the two.


A need for low-cost CO2 and H2O
According to the GX, over the next seven years METI plans to develop synthetic fuels
tech while supporting the build out of the supply chain for hydrogen and ammonia.

17


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

This would allow for synthetic fuels to enter use in the 2030s and ramp up
to commercial scale by the 2040s.

The challenge in developing viable synthetic fuel is how to secure a large amount of
low-cost CO2 and hydrogen through renewable energy. One of the world’s biggest
projects in this field is taking place in Chile. The Haru Oni Project will capture CO2
from the atmosphere and use synthesis to combine it with hydrogen to make eFuels
such as carbon neutral gasoline (eGasoline) and carbon neutral Liquefied Gas (eLG).
While the fuels would release CO2 when burned, capturing the carbon is supposed to
lead to a continuous cycle of its reuse and recycling.

No Japanese firms are active in the Chile project, so METI has decided to push e-fuels
in the domestic market through a newly established public and private partnership.
The PPP will get financing from the state’s Green Innovation Foundation (GIF) for R&D
into synthetic fuels. To date, only a handful of major Japanese companies such as
Toyota, Nissan, Honda and ENEOS have begun research into synthetic fuels.

【Synthetic Methane…CO2+hydrogen→Gaseous fuel】
Synthetic methane is made from CO2 and hydrogen; "e-methane" is a synthetic
methane made from CO2 and hydrogen produced by renewable energy sources.
While synthetic fuels are mainly used for vehicles - cars, ships and airplanes - synthetic
methane is mainly deployed by utilities in place of natural gas. In theory, synthetic
methane could also fuel LNG-powered vessels; however, such plans have yet to
materialize.

The GX strategy calls for e-methane to replace 1% of total utility gas consumption by
2030, and to increase that figure to 90% by 2050. According to the Japan Gas
Association, switching just 1% of city gas demand to e-methane would cut emissions
by about 800,000 tons of CO2 equivalent a year.

Should Japan manage to hit the 90% target, it would save 80 million tons of CO2,
which is equivalent to 7% of the nation’s current emissions total.

In addition to the environmental benefit, synthetic methane can utilize existing utility
gas networks and equipment.

Demo-scale production and use of e-methane started earlier this year in the
Fukushima prefecture, where engineering group IHI has started to supply the fuel to
local government run buses.

A more meaningful amount will be produced domestically by Tokyo Gas from around
2025. By 2030, the company plans to import synthetic methane from the U.S.

Other Japanese firms interested in developing synthetic methane now include Osaka
Gas, Saibu Gas, Hiroshima Gas, Toho Gas, Mitsui OSK Line, IHI, and Hitachi Zosen.


Near-term low-hanging fruit
The biggest gains for biofuels in the near term could come from increasing the ratio of
bio stock to regular gasoline. Internationally, the practice of blending 10% of ethanol
in every liter of gasoline is common. Japan, however, has among the world’s lowest
blending ratio, with just 1.7% of locally sold gasoline made up from ethanol as base

18


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

material of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE).

These numbers may change as political support for a higher blending ratio in Japan
picks up. In a joint announcement last year, President Joe Biden and Prime Minister
Kishida said Japan will aim to double its bioethanol demand by 2030.

Implementation of the political pronouncement has been slow and policies remain
vague. After all, the GX strategy barely mentions biofuels like ethanol. However,
industry experts claim that Japan could score an easy win by increasing its 1.7%
blending ratio to 10% (the so-called E10 standard), reducing emissions and cutting
costs at the same time.

According to Nippon Environmental Energy Development (NEED), the price of E10
fuel is ¥8/ liter cheaper than regular gasoline. Moreover, global supply of ethanol is
plentiful. If Japan introduced E10, its total ethanol demand would reach 2.47 million
liters per year, NEED calculations show. That’s a fraction of the 55 million liters
produced in the U.S. and 38 million liters in Brazil.

At a time of energy security tensions, increasing the ethanol component in the
gasoline mix could also help Japan eliminate the need to import crude from places
like Russia, according to NEED.


Conclusion
Policy documents like the GX seek to paint ambitious targets and present a future that
is at least a decade away. They present markers for the sector R&D and indicate which
net-zero pathways the government will likely support with policies and funding.

In that sense, e-fuels or synthetic fuels that recycle carbon will grab most of the
attention. However, in the more immediate future, METI is likely to open up the
domestic market to existing biofuels and blended fuels to meet 2030 CO2 reduction
objectives.

In the meantime, an area to watch is the evolution of nature-based biofuels. Today’s
green fuels are made from corn, wheat and sugar beet – a direct starch to sugar to
ethanol process. But a so-called second generation of biofuels seek to harness
cellulose matter like wood and plants and even city waste. The cellulose can be
converted to sugar and then ethanol, while also not competing with food crops for
land.

With so much R&D going in the sector, it is understandable why the government is
keeping the roadmap for clean fuels vague. With several irons in the fire, Japan hopes
for a chance to pick the best trends in the markets and technologies.

Cutting Back on Crude:
Shooting for the Moon with Biodegradable Plastics


By the end of this decade, Japan hopes to have at least three new clean energy
solutions for plastics, which has emerged as the fastest growing area for crude oil.

Plastics are everywhere, but few people realize the significant amount of fossil fuels
that go into their production, and that they are a major product for the petrochemical
industry. By 2030, the sector may account for as much one third of the world’s
petroleum demand, according to International Energy Agency forecasts.

According to Plastics Europe, 390 million tons of plastics were produced globally in
2021. Only 10% are recycled. Equally, only 10% of all plastics produced in 2021 came
from a “green” source. Plastic-related GHGs constitute close to 3% of the world’s
CO2 emissions.

This makes the widespread use of plastic for both industrial and personal consumption
an overlooked aspect of the energy transition. In addition to the threat from
greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) during their production, plastics carry the threat of
environmental contamination since they break down very slowly, until they become
microplastics that permeate every aspect of our environment. These materials were
recently detected in the bloodstream of people, animals and fish.

According to the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), emissions from
the plastics sector already rose 15% from 2012 to 2018. One year’s worth of emissions
from plastic production is estimated to contribute the equivalent of 189 large coal
plants. That figure could triple by 2050, unless action is taken.

While Japan is not among the top 10 big plastic consumers in the world on a per
capita basis, Japan ranks No. 2 in discarding plastic waste, which indicates that single-
use plastics account for much of the total.

This is why Japan has embarked on an ambitious program to improve its sustainable
impact, with special focus on finding a new generation of non-toxic plastics that won’t
detrimentally impact the environment. Last month, the so-called Moonshot R&D
Program delivered promising early-stage results.


Background
Plastics are a very convenient material for the modern world – tough, durable, and
readily available at an affordable price. But when discarded in public dumps the rains
can slowly wash them to the ocean where they harm the fragile aquatic environment.

The United Nations Environment Program estimates that nine million tons of plastic
flow into the sea annually, and that as many as 700 species in the sea, including
endangered species, have been damaged by plastic tangles or accidental ingestion of
plastic. This has adverse impacts on food chains and ecosystems.

| Program delivered promising early-stage results. |

The feedstocks for plastics are derived from natural gas processing, as well as from
crude oil refining. Petrochemicals have become a huge moneymaker for oil and gas
firms over the past decade. The IEA predicts that plastics’ consumption of oil will
outpace that of cars by 2050. Oil majors such as ExxonMobil are betting on this trend
in the face of a shift to the electric-powered engine.

Left unchecked, this explosion of plastics would have a significant impact on global
biosystems. Towards a solution, Japan has set up a new program that could find
radical solutions to the plastics issue and other key areas of sustainability.

The Moonshot R&D Program was established in 2020 via the Council for Science,
Technology and Innovation (CSTI) to promote ambitious R&D goals based on bold
ideas that were not just extensions of conventional technologies. The program is led
by NEDO, the state R&D hub, and aims to help the country create a circular and
sustainable economy by 2050, as well as touting Japanese innovation on the global
stage.


At present, there are 13 Moonshot projects and they are divided into three
categories:
1) development of tech to recover GHGs and convert them into valuable materials;
2) development of tech to recover nitrogen compounds and convert them into
harmless or useful materials; and
3) development of marine biodegradable plastics that can control the timing and
speed of their degradability.

In mid-January, several groups of researchers working on plastics issues shared their
latest progress results.


Solution 1: Degradable biopolymers
There are three Moonshot teams working to develop and commercialize an ideal
polymer that degrades in the ocean. The first team is developing multi-lock
biopolymers made from non-food biomass that can degrade in ocean water. This
project is led by Dr. Kohzo Ito of the University of Tokyo and involves Mitsubishi
Chemical, Bridgestone, Teijin, Kureha, Kyushu University, Nagoya University,
Yamagata University, AIST, Ehime University, and the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

Dr. Ito and his team seek to develop an ideal polymer that remains tough during use
and degrades easily when released into the environment, triggered by multi-lock
degradation.

By late 2024, the team plans to fully develop technologies for commercialization of
the new polymers. Then they’ll set up the production process, optimize it, start mass
production, and strive to bring costs down through 2027. By the end of 2029, the plan
is to have the new material be ready for commercial production.

A second team is investigating marine biodegradable plastics with degradation

members are from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Institute of
Physical and Chemical Research, and Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and
Technology (JAMSTEC), and supported by Kaneka and Nisshinbo Chemical.
Among currently available biodegradable plastics, only a few are able to degrade in
the ocean. The best examples are polyhydroxy alkanoic acid (PHA) and
polycaprolactone polyester (PCL). But even these two take six to seven years or longer
to degrade, so the research team is trying to devise a so-called “switching function”
to shorten the time to two years or less.
In 2020-2022, more than 40 different kinds of switches and new materials were tested
by placing them deep under the ocean off the coast of Japan where there’s a lot of
plastic waste. Some of those switches were collected for verification and analysis.

As a result, the team developed four of the most promising switching functions, which
trigger degradation of the material when it flows into the ocean or touches sea
bottom.

Using this know-how, the team aims by 2029 to develop at least three new
biodegradable plastics that degrade 90% or more within six months in water at a
temperature of 30°C. In addition, the team will create a new marine bio-degradable
material using biomass and CO2 as main ingredients.


Solution 3: Edible plastics
A third project is focused on one of the most innovative and promising technologies –
ocean degradable plastics with edibility. The project is led by Dr. Tatsuo Kaneko of
Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) in partnership with Kobe
University, Nagoya University, Kagoshima University, Tokyo University of Science,
Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, AIST, and the Osaka Research
Institute of Industrial Science and Technology (ORIST).

The team aims to develop photo-switching, ocean-degradable plastics. This photo-
switch, however, isn’t turned on by any light source, but rather turned on only under
specific conditions, such as in the ocean or alkaline underwater environment.

The goal is to make the plastic “edible” – meaning it will be soft and easily
degradable by water and light, or it decomposes in the digestive tract, and
decomposes completely with nothing left undigested.

As of today, the team has successfully developed a bio-nylon polymer with marine
biodegradability from sorghum. They’ve also identified composites of photo-switch
models that are fed to marine life and have so far been digested with no negative
effects.

The extraordinary work of these Moonshot projects gives hope that a major
breakthrough is on the horizon. The hope is that once biodegradable plastics are
commercialized, the world will again see cleaner oceans.

Yet with these solutions only expected to be widely available by 2030, will a solution
come too late? In seven years even greater amounts of plastics will have poisoned our
oceans, our food sources and thus, ourselves. Plastics are convenient and
indispensable for modern lives, but they also leave a strong impact on the
environment.

Experts say that the issue of cost remains the biggest obstacle for biodegradable
plastics. If these solutions are too expensive, then they won’t be widely implemented.
At some point, society may need to start putting a value not only on CO2, but also on
human health.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Algeria/ Oil and gas
Chevron is in talks to conduct energy exploration with state-owned Sonatrach, the
third-biggest natural gas exporter to the EU. Nearly 85% of Algeria’s gas exports
already go to the EU, but it plans to double that volume.

Asia/ Pipelines
Over the next five years, about $24 billion is expected to be spent on subsea and
offshore pipelines in Asia Pacific, according to Wood Mackenzie. In 2023 alone, about
$6.4 billion will be spent to upgrade the region’s subsea and offshore pipelines, up
64% from the $3.9 billion spent in 2022. Australia will be the largest destination for
subsea investment,

China/ Energy transition
China again led the world in clean energy investments, accounting for nearly half of
low-carbon spending in 2022. Beijing invested $546 billion; the EU – $180 billion, and
the U.S. – $141 billion, reported Bloomberg.

Denmark/ Carbon capture
The first licences to capture and store carbon went to Wintershall Dea, INEOS Energy
and TotalEnergies. By 2025, the $65 million Greensand project will annually inject up
to 1.5 million tons of CO2 into depleted North Sea oil and gas fields. Annual capacity
will increase to 8 million tons by 2030.

Denmark/ Wind power
The Danish Energy Agency suspended reviews of existing and new applications for
installing wind farms and other renewable energy projects, citing a potential conflict
with EU law.

India/ Hydrogen
TotalEnergies paused a $4 billion investment in a green hydrogen project that
involves taking a 25% stake in Adani New Industries. Total has just over $3 billion of
investments with Adani, including in gas distribution and solar projects.

India/ Natural gas
ONGC Videsh, the overseas exploration arm of the Oil and Natural Gas Corp, is
looking for opportunities in Africa and Latin America. PM Modi said India’s gas
demand will rise 500%, while its share of global oil demand will double. Modi,
however, didn’t specify a timeframe for those increases.

Italy/ Natural gas
“REPowerEU”, the EU’s plan to wean itself off Russian gas and turn Italy into an
energy hub, might help build the so-called SoutH2 Corridor. This link would bring
hydrogen produced in North Africa to northern Europe.

Nord Stream
U.S. investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a report accusing the White
House of ordering the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline in September, and that
Norway cooperated. Both the U.S. and Norway producers have profited from selling
gas to the EU in place of Russian supply. The White House denied the accusation.

Russia/ Oil
Since Asia is now the leading buyer of Russian oil, the EU will no longer set the
reference price for Urals crude. Around 70% of January-loading cargoes of Urals oil is
destined to India. In return, Russia is now India’s largest supplier of oil, replacing Iraq.
