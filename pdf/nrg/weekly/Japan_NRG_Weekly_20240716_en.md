NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Cabinet working group outlines 2040 GX 2.0 strategy

(Government statement, July 11)
•  The Working Group of Experts for the Realization of GX, an advisory panel to the Cabinet,
published an outline of the 2040 GX 2.0 strategy, which is an updated GX strategy PM Kishida
announced in May.
•  It will have four focus points:
o  Energy – spurring investments into decarbonized power; expanding power transmission
network; securing new power sources by exploring hydrogen and ammonia potentials;

continuing to secure thermal power sources amid the transition;
o  Identifying GX industry locations such as supply bases;
o  Designing GX industry structure – introducing new processes to heavy emitting industries
such as steel, speeding up commercialization of perovskite technologies, strengthening
supply chains with allies;
o  Creating a GX market through effective carbon pricing.
•  The Working Group will meet in early August before the GX Implementation Council and will

interview experts.
•  By the end of 2024, the Council will write a draft 2040 strategy.
•  CONTEXT: The GX Act was passed by Japan’s govt in July 2023, and it will drive ¥150 trillion
worth of energy transition investments from the public and private sectors to realize carbon
neutrality in 2050. However, officials say that the GX must simultaneously strengthen industrial
competitiveness and achieve economic growth.




ANRE panel urges more state involvement in power supply development

(Denki Shimbun, July 9)
•  An ANRE experts panel working on the next Basic Energy Plan urged stronger state involvement in
power supplies, as nuclear plants are aging and the increase in renewables capacity is slowing.
If decarbonized power supplies don’t keep up with demand from the semiconductor and data
center industries, then the growth of the national economy will slow, warned some panelists.
•  There were suggestions to increase support for small and medium-sized power operators and
setting targets to spread installation of perovskite solar cell systems.
•  However, Takamura Yukari of Tokyo University warned that overestimating future demand will

result in inefficient power which will raise power rates.
•  Murase Yoshifumi, the ANRE Commissioner, said the govt needs to set up a framework to improve
visibility into power investments, adding that repurposing of thermal plants to generate
decarbonized power is also important.

Local LDP members in Fukui Pref appeal to METI for early replacement of NPP reactors
(Denki Shimbun, July 12)
•  Senior members of the Liberal Democratic Party's Mihama Town branch and Fukui Prefecture’s
House of Councillors member Takinami Hirofumi met with METI's Parliamentary Vice-Minister

Yoshida Nobuhiro. They asked for replacement of current reactors with next-generation reactors in
order to improve safety.
•  He also stressed the need for evacuation roads to Shiga Pref, and extension of the Hokuriku
Shinkansen (bullet train) beyond Tsuruga.
•  Yamaguchi emphasized the town's pride in being a "pioneer in hosting nuclear power plants". Yet,
there are challenges in maintaining a community that coexists with nuclear power and ensuring
greater safety and security.

•  Yoshida explained that the GX Promotion Strategy approved by the Cabinet last year included
plans to replace decommissioned reactors with next-gen reactors. He assured that METI would
continue working towards this goal.




METI to consider trading DAC CO2 removal credits for international transfer
(Denki Shimbun, July 10)
•  METI will study the international transfer of CO2 removal credits earned by Direct Air Capture
(DAC), a technology that directly captures and stores CO2.
•  As a prerequisite for proceeding with an international agreement on the transfer of such removal

credits, it’s necessary to consider which countries to prioritize, taking into account local legal
regulations on CO2 capture and storage.
•  Promising countries include Australia and the U.S.
•  METI will consider efforts to coordinate the international transfer of CO2 removal credits based on
the Paris Agreement.
• TAKEAWAY: The majority of carbon credits relate to avoided emissions, through actions such as protecting the
environment or replacing energy sources with cleaner alternatives. The act of removing CO2 from the

atmosphere, however, is much more resource (and capital) intensive, and therefore results in more expensive
carbon credits. Proponents of DAC and other CO2 removal technologies say that the removal credits should
carry more weight or have some other differentiation factor to encourage their further development.

To expand demand for DAC credits, Japan needs to show progress on DAC and CO2 removal. The U.S.
forecasts one billion tons of CO2 removal annually by 2050; the EU forecasts 400 million tons per year in 2040.




JERA, Shizen Connect to trial 24/7 carbon-free energy supply
(Company statement, July 10)
•  In December, JERA, JERA Cross and Shizen Connect, a VPP platform developer, will begin a trial

for the supply of 24/7 carbon-free energy.

5



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  JERA and JERA Cross will act as aggregators of multiple power sources including renewables and
batteries, and will forecast demand and power generation. Battery charging and discharging plans
will be produced based on these forecasts.
•  Shizen Connect will control the batteries remotely, adjusting charging and discharging plans based
on real-time monitoring of actual data to balance supply and demand.
•  Trial supply of 24/7 CFE for specific projects is expected to start in January 2025.

•  CONTEXT: There is growing interest in 24/7 CFE, which aligns hourly power consumption with
supply to utilize renewables in real time; this is considered a more progressive approach than the
current way of offsetting CO2 emissions through renewables certificates. JERA Cross has been
researching 24/7 CFE tracking and certification with the University of Tokyo. To support this, JERA
has invested in Shizen Connect.




ENECHANGE's results worsen due to consolidated financial statement correction

(Denki Shimbun, July 11)
•  ENECHANGE revised its consolidated financial results for 2023 in response to a review in
the accounting of its EV charging subsidiary.
•  After the revision, the consolidated financial results announced in February saw sales decrease by
¥2.2 billion, while the net loss worsened by ¥3.7 billion.
•  To meet the criteria for a listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Growth Market, the company needs
to improve its net assets to a positive value by the end of 2024.
•  CONTEXT: In February, ENECHANGE said it would raise about ¥4 billion through a third-party

allotment of new shares, and expected net assets to be positive as of Q1 2024; but that forecast
never materialized.




Amazon partners with Cosmo Energy and ENEOS to increase renewables procurement
(Nikkei, July 10)
•  Amazon plans to increase procurement of renewables in Japan, sourcing from wind and solar farms
to be built by Cosmo Energy and ENEOS subsidiaries by fall 2025. Amazon's investment will be
about ¥50 billion.
•  CONTEXT: A string of investments by tech giants such as Google should help accelerate the use of

renewable energy in Japan.
•  Cosmo Eco Power, a subsidiary of oil refiner Cosmo, and ENEOS Renewable Energy, a subsidiary
of ENEOS, inked a 20-year PPA. The firms will supply the power generated at their facilities directly
to Amazon.
•  Amazon's procurement of renewable energy in Japan is expected to increase by 60%. With the
operation of the Cosmo and ENEOS power generation facilities, Amazon’s total annual power

consumption in Japan is expected to increase to around 250 GWh.

Yamaha Motor’s aluminum remelters to switch to hydrogen from city gas
(Company statement, July 10)
•  Yamaha Motor will start a switch to hydrogen from city gas at its automotive component plants. Its
remelter, which melts aluminum alloy ingots before they’re put into the casting machine for making

wheels, etc, will be fueled by hydrogen to reduce carbon footprints.
•  In 2025, trial runs of a hydrogen-fueled remelter will begin at the Morimachi plant (Shizuoka Pref.).
After over a year of tests, Yamaha’s other plants will also begin the transition, in 2027.
•  CONTEXT: Yamaha Motor uses an alloy called A356 that contains aluminum, magnesium and
silicon, each with different melting points. Temperature controls are important to maintain quality
consistency of final products such as vehicle wheels.
• TAKEAWAY: In the aluminum production cycle, the metal is melted twice. First for making the alloy, by mixing

aluminum and other elements, and secondly to process the alloy into wheels and other products. Energy
efficiency improves if there’s only one melting process, but a solution hasn’t yet been found.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Itochu takes stake in U.S. hydrogen aircraft engine maker
(Company statement, July 9)
o  Itochu acquired a stake in ZeroAvia, a U.S. developer of hydrogen engines for aircrafts,
and will represent the company in Asia.
o  The two also inked an MoU to collaborate on maintenance services, and to explore
airport and hydrogen infrastructure opportunities in Asia.
o  CONTEXT: By 2032, ZeroAvia plans to develop hydrogen-powered, 200-passenger

aircraft engines. It developed a 19-seat aircraft engine last year and has won pre-orders
for 2,000 engines from airlines.
• TAKEAWAY: ZeroAvia uses cryo-compression to store hydrogen, a technology combining liquefaction and
compression methods. It competes with technologies developed by Japanese aircraft engine makers. Cryo-
compression and liquid hydrogen face similar challenges: to keep the storage container completely insulated,
to make it smaller and reduce the weight.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toyota Tsusho, Germany’s Messer set up green hydrogen JV
(Company statement, July 11)
o  Toyota Tsusho and Germany’s Messer set up a JV, SympH2ony.

o  Based in Germany, it will produce and supply green hydrogen, and will develop fuel cell-
driven mobility services.




AESC to produce lithium iron phosphate batteries in Spain
(Company statement, July 11)
•  Starting 2026, Yokohama-based Automotive Energy Supply Corporation (AESC) plans production
in Spain of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for EV and energy storage systems.
•  This will be one of Europe’s first mass LFP production. AESC has invested over a billion euros for
the first phase of LFP production.

•  CONTEXT: LFP does not use nickel or cobalt, and has been a cheaper alternative to lithium ion
batteries. It has spurred the EV market expansion in China.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: Nikkei reported that AESC is studying LFP production in Japan. Some industry observers have
blamed high battery costs, as well as limited charging stations, as the cause of Japan’s slow transition to EVs
from gasoline vehicles. Lithium prices are dropping in recent months due to weaker demand in China. In
theory, the lower prices should boost sales of not just LFP but also more expensive lithium ion batteries.





ClassNK and Singapore to step up methanol, biofuel bunkering guidelines
(Japan NRG, July 9)
•  ClassNK plans to step up efforts to write methanol bunkering guidelines, working with Singapore’s
Ministry of Transport and local bunkering service providers.
•  On July 2, ClassNK and Singapore-based Yanmar Asia, Taiko Asia Pacific and Consort Bunkers
signed a MoU to explore vessel equipment details required for methanol and biofuel bunkering.

•  The framework will be crucial in updating Japan’s bunkering guidelines, ClassNK told Japan NRG.
•  CONTEXT: The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism will write the bunkering
guidelines with input from Japan Coast Guard and the shipping sector. The guidelines cover
marine fuel oil and LNG; studies on ammonia bunkering began in January. Methanol and biofuel
have not yet entered the study scope.
• TAKEAWAY: Singapore has the world’s largest bunkering operations. In December 2023, Japan and Singapore
launched the Green and Digital Shipping Corridor to develop standards for new shipping fuels. As a result,

Japan would be importing methanol and biofuel standards, while likely exporting ammonia standards once
developed.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

ORIX orders three methanol-fueled bulk ships
(Company statement, July 8)
o  ORIX ordered two dual-fuel bulk ships from Tsuneishi Shipbuilding that use methanol

•  The new criteria will clarify that the green transformation and digital transformation are essential for
strengthening the competitive strength of Japanese businesses. The present criteria do not

address GX or DX directly.
•  CONTEXT: JIC is a public-private financing vehicle mostly funded by the govt, and with a minor
contribution from 24 companies that includes ENEOS and Osaka Gas.




Japan-Arab economic forum confirms deeper relationship
(Government statement, July 11)
•  METI Minister Saito, Foreign Minister Kamikawa, and 10 ministerial-level delegates from the
League of Arab States joined the 5th Japan-Arab Economic Forum in Tokyo.
•  They shared views on sustainable and resilient economic development, energy and economic

security cooperation, resources development, etc.

Forecast: Japan’s power curtailment could reach 25% of renewables capacity by 2030

(Nikkei, July 11)
•  GE Vernova, a U.S. energy equipment manufacturer, says that Japan’s curtailment rate could reach
25% of operating renewables capacity by 2030 due to the growth of renewable energy and the
restart of nuclear power plants.
•  CONTEXT: Curtailment results in a lower efficiency of assets since they are forced to operate
below potential capacity.
•  The U.S. firm looked into four scenarios, based on the planned restart of NPPs and expansion of

renewables.
•  If more NPPs restart than planned, and renewable energy continues expanding smoothly, then the
curtailment rate for renewable energy is forecasted to be 25%.
•  CONTEXT: At present, Kyushu is the region with the highest level of curtailments in Japan, a rate
that hit 8.3% of capacity in FY2023.
•  By 2050, curtailment rates could even be higher - above 30%, if the number of nuclear units online
are more than planned.

•  GE Vernova believes that electricity supply could be stabilized by introducing more gas-fired
power generation and hydrogen production tech.
• TAKEAWAY: Grid connectivity is seen as one of the biggest challenges faced by local utilities in stabilizing the
power grid. GE Vernova’s forecast appears to be based on the current trend, echoing growing concerns in
Japan that the curtailment rate will only increase. However, with investments in grid connectivity and BESS
tech to address grid congestion, the curtailment rate could be reduced.





Inpex to invest over ¥200 billion in Australia renewables through 2030
(Nikkei Asia, July 13)
•  Inpex plans to invest more than ¥200 billion yen ($1.25 billion) in Australian renewables projects
through 2030. This includes creating power sources to create ‘green’ hydrogen for export to
Japan.
•  Itochu’s JV with Italian utility Enel, Enel Green Power Australia, will boost its renewables capacity

from about 300 MW to between 2 GW and 4 GW at the end of the decade. The additions should
be mostly split between solar, onshore wind and storage batteries.
•  Some of the electricity from the new projects will be used to power the Ichthys LNG project,
operated by Inpex, after 2030.
•  For storage batteries, Inpex plans to utilize the supply and demand adjustment market and also
pursue retail sales.

•  Further along, Inpex will explore green-hydrogen manufacturing options in Australia.

NRA inspects Fukushima NPP facilities ahead of planned debris retrieval
(Jiji Press, July 5)
•  NRA Chairman Yamanaka Shinsuke visited TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi NPP to inspect the facilities
related to the retrieval of melted nuclear fuel debris.
•  The planned retrieval is scheduled to start as early as August.

•  Yamanaka checked entry ways for bringing in robotic arms to retrieve the debris, as well as the
sealed containers.
• TAKEAWAY: Starting debris removal is essential for evaluating its composition. Also, it’s important to improve
decommissioning and reduce ongoing contamination. As TEPCO can only remove debris in small quantities at
a time, it might take decades. What's more, there are many uncertainties over where to store and how to
manage contaminated waste.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO sets up new department for Fukushima decommissioning
o  TEPCO will set up a new department to develop plans for and manage the

decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP. The new department will be called the
"Decommissioning Strategy Office," and will start on August 1.
o  It plans to start trial retrieval of fuel debris by the end of FY2024.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO reveals unauthorized access in Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP
(Nikkei, July 11)
o  Two cases of unauthorized access were recorded at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP in

March. Two workers brought smartphones into a restricted area with no permission.
o  The workers forgot about the smartphones, and security guards did not notice.
o  The incident raises concerns over security at the plant.
o  CONTEXT: TEPCO owns and operates Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, which was once the
largest NPP in the world by capacity; Unit 7 is penciled in for a restart in October.
However, the plant operator is still trying to convince the local authorities to give it the

final go-ahead.



KEPCO's Takahama NPP Units 3-4 secure approval for operation extension

(Company statement, July 9)
•  Fukui Pref and Takahama Town gave KEPCO approval for an operation extension of Takahama
NPP Units 3-4.
•  KEPCO reaffirmed its commitment to the safety of its NPPs.
•  CONTEXT: Operational since November 1974, Takahama’s four units have a total power capacity
of 3.4 GW. Since the upgrade of the safety standards in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster,

nuclear operators have additional checks every 10 years on facilities that are 30 years old and
above.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: The process of extending NPP operations is smoother compared to restarting reactors. While the
latter involves consent of the local community, a condition that’s not required by law but essential in practice,
extending operation does not.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
KEPCO receives preliminary approval for renovation of Takahama Units 3 and 4
(Company statement, July 9)
o  KEPCO received preliminary approval from Fukui Pref and Takahama Town for
renovation plans at Takahama NPP Units 3 and 4. Work to start in mid 2026.

in Takahama NPP Units 1 and 2 relating to a reactor installation permit for replacement of
in-core structures.




TEPCO PG, KEPCO receive power transfer due to extreme heat

(Japan NRG, Company statement, July 8)
•  On July 8, TEPCO Power Grid received electricity from Chubu Electric Power Grid due to higher-
than-expected temperatures that boosted demand amid increased air conditioning use.
•  Up to 200 MW of power was sent between 9 a.m. and noon, as the reserve ratio in TEPCO's
service area fell below the 3% buffer required for reliable supply.
•  The firm said it recorded peak demand after 2 p.m., at 54.9 GW.
•  This is the first time in about two years, since August 2022, that TEPCO has had to receive power

from another company.
•  KEPCO subsidiary Kansai Transmission and Distribution also received electricity from Chubu
Electric PG due to extreme heat. The firm’s reserve ratio temporarily fell below 3% after 6:00 p.m.
It received 360 MW from 6:30 p.m.
•  The Tokyo area had severe heat on July 9, with max electricity demand exceeding 50 GW for the
second day in a row. However, power transfer was not required.
•  CONTEXT: So far this year, the number of power transfer cases is already the third highest after 24

incidents nationwide in 2022 and 17 in 2018.
• TAKEAWAY: The heat wave in Japan has energy firms looking for more LNG cargoes to meet increased
demand as the heat boosts A/C use and power demand.

•  The firms aim to start commercial operation by late 2025, and plan to use lithium-ion batteries with
a 8 MWh capacity and 2 MW output.
•  Osaka Gas will manage operation of storage batteries and trading on electricity markets
(wholesale, balancing and capacity markets).
•  This will be Osaka Gas’ second investment in the grid storage battery business, following Senri

Grid Storage.
•  CONTEXT: Saga Pref is in the northwest of Kyushu, located in south Japan. The Kyushu region is
Japan’s leading supply of solar power and oversupply often leads to power curtailments, requiring
grid stabilization. Grid congestion is a major reason for power curtailment. In Kyushu, the
curtailment rate soared in FY2023, reaching up to 7-8% of renewables capacity.




Aomori Pref and Mutsu discuss spent nuclear fuel interim storage facility
(Nikkei, July 8)
•  Aomori Pref and Mutsu City met to discuss plans for an interim storage facility for spent nuclear

fuel. Mutsu City residents raised concerns about the final destination of the spent fuel after 50
years.
•  Representatives from Recyclable Fuel Storage (RFS), TEPCO, Japan Nuclear Fuel, and govt officials
attended.
•  A key focus was Article 4 of the safety agreement, which stipulates a 50-year storage period for the
spent nuclear fuel before its transportation to a reprocessing plant. The interim storage facility, in
theory, manages the fuel until it can be reprocessed.

•  RFS aims to begin operations of the first storage building by September, with plans for a second
building.
•  CONTEXT: RFS is a company founded by TEPCO and Japan Atomic Power Co. It’s dedicated to
building the facility in Mutsu.
• TAKEAWAY: As in the case of KEPCO’s fuel temporarily stored on the NPPs’ premises, local consent relies on
the promise of future transportation to long-term and reprocessing storage facilities. However, the considered

final destination – the Rokkasho spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plant – has faced delays for 31 years, as the
NRA requests safety improvements. Until the govt can offer a concrete long-term solution for spent nuclear
fuel, the short-term and mid-term storage facility projects will be met with skepticism by locals.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Japanese refineries produced 1,157,052 kiloliters (7.3 mln barrels) of jet fuel in May, up
18.7% YoY, and imported 5,876 kl, flat YoY. Domestic sales, including domestic and imported jet
fuel, were 368,649 kl, up 9% YoY. During the month, Japan exported 708,293 kl, up 0.4% YoY.
• TAKEAWAY: According to ANRE, the end-May jet fuel stocks stood at 826,515 kl, up 5.2% YoY and up 10.4%
MoM. The shortage appears to be in limited areas due to a lack of domestic transport means, or the govt

would have asked the refineries to suspend exports. The introduction of strict overtime limits on truck drivers in
Japan from April 2024 has affected a number of industries because there’s a general shortage of drivers in the
country. Record inbound tourism numbers have added to the demand picture.




LNG stocks down by 5.7% from previous week, down nearly 10% over 5-year average

(Government data, July 10)
•  LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 1.98 million tons as of July 7, down 5.7% from the previous

down from the past 5-year average of 2.19 million tons for the end of July.
•  CONTEXT: There’s been a surge in use of gas-fired power plants to meet additional power
demand due to heat. Output from the gas plants in the Tokyo region is up by close to half on the
previous month.
•  CONTEXT: The Japan Weather Association predicts that the rainy season will end in the third week

of July in south Japan, and a week after for the northern part. Except for the Tohoku area, the rainy
season is due to last a bit longer than usual.

Hydrogen’s Atomic Dreams: Japan Aims for
Hydrogen Production With Nuclear Power

In early 2010, a High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) in the town of
Oarai, northeast of Tokyo, generated a temperature of 950°C that was enough to help
produce hydrogen for 150 hours. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) and others
thought that a cost and energy efficient way of producing hydrogen had been found.

Those hopes were dashed in March 2011 when the Fukushima Daiichi disaster led to a
shutdown of the country’s entire nuclear power fleet.

After a decade of dormancy, in 2021 the JAEA brought the HTTR project back online,
as well as the research. A new milestone was reached in March this year when a safety
demonstration test proved that the reactor could cool by itself in case of an accident.
This has reignited hopes for nuclear power-based hydrogen production.


High-temperature, gas-cooled reactors like the HTTR have the potential to also add
another color to the hydrogen rainbow. While colors like green, blue and gray have
been popular in describing, respectively, hydrogen production via renewables, CCS,
and fossil fuels, hydrogen produced with nuclear power is labeled as pink.

International competition is one reason why Japan has restarted its program. Poland,
the UK and the U.S. all have similar projects. China, however, has made the most
progress, launching in December 2023 the world’s first modular high-temperature,
gas-cooled reactor nuclear power plant; this HTR-PM features two small reactors (each
250 MW) that uses helium as coolant and graphite as the moderator.

Japan NRG reached out to the JAEA for updates on the HTTR development, funding
and international cooperation.

The test, the reactor
On March 27-28, the JAEA did a safety demonstration test for the 30 MW HTTR
reactor. Among the five next-generation advanced reactor types designated by the
government in the latest nuclear industry roadmap, the high-temperature gas-cooled
reactor (HTGR) is expected to be one of the first to reach the proof-of-concept test
stage. The HTTR design is the first example of an HTGR in Japan, and the JAEA seeks
to advance it to make a commercial system.

The JAEA conducted the test at 100% power at the Oarai Research & Development
Institute (Ibaraki Prefecture) without inserting control rods and with the coolant flow
set to zero. They stopped the helium circulator, thus losing the forced cooling
function. It confirmed that the reactor could decrease its output, cool down and
stabilize by itself.

The reactor’s enhanced safety features is a key advantage, together with the
possibility of hydrogen manufacturing. In theory, the reactor won’t suffer a core
meltdown in case of an accident.

The reactor’s key component is the graphite in the core that can endure high
temperatures. Unlike most reactors (which use water), the HTTR uses helium gas for
cooling. The core has a large heat capacity, and the test showed that even during an
incident the temperature changes gradually due to the graphite, which can withstand
heat up to 2,500°C.

Schedules and funding
The government has a schedule for developing a demonstration high-temperature
gas-cooled reactor. According to the "Basic Policy for Realizing GX" the start of
operations is expected in the 2030s. METI's Innovation Reactor Working Group also
established a roadmap for the construction of the demo reactor.


ANRE began the HTGR Demonstration Reactor Development Project in FY2023.
Through public recruitment, they selected Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which
handles basic design and future manufacturing of the HTGR Demonstration Reactor.
Following this, MHI began the basic design of the demo reactor in the same year.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

As for funding, in FY2023, the government allocated ¥1.83 billion for R&D of HTGR
and its heat use technology. In FY2024, funding was ¥2.27 billion. Also, under the GX
Promotion Measures, ¥4.8 billion was given in FY2023 for the "HTGR Demonstration
Reactor Development Project". Another ¥127.9 (¥43.1 billion + ¥84.8 billion) has been
allocated for the budget from FY2023 to FY2027. JAEA said that, together with MHI,
it will proceed with development based on the technical roadmap for the introduction
of HTGR.

Hydrogen production
JAEA said there are plans for R&D using the HTTR, but it’s considering connecting a
hydrogen production facility to it. This will be the first such unit in the world and
should prove that hydrogen can be made using heat from a reactor.


















Source: JAEA

Japan has considered producing hydrogen via nuclear power for a while. The
electrolysis process that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen can be powered with
electricity from solar or wind farms. Yet, due to their low operational rates, the amount
of time that the electrolysis equipment is operating drops, leading to higher costs.
The other mainstream way of making hydrogen utilizes fossil fuels.

Turning to a nuclear facility like the HTTR may provide a hydrogen manufacturing
option that doesn’t rely on hydrocarbons or the vagaries of the weather. Its
proponents also say it will be a cheaper alternative to ‘green’ hydrogen made with
electricity from renewables.

The government plans to use HTTR’s heat for producing hydrogen via the Iodine-
Sulfur (IS) process that involves thermochemical water splitting using high-temperature
heat sources. It combines iodine and sulfur chemical reactions. In the process, the
temperature for water decomposition is lowered from about 4,000°C to below 900°C.


The iodine and sulfur are recycled, resulting in the decomposition of water into
hydrogen and oxygen. To prove the commercial viability of this approach, HTTR tech
will need to scale up the reactor’s thermal output, from 30 MW to around 600 MW.

International cooperation
The JAEA is also keen on international collaboration with countries pursuing HTGR
projects. Currently, collaborations are progressing with the UK and Poland. The UK
government selected HTGR as an innovative reactor for the non-power sector towards
net-zero GHG emissions, and began the HTGR Demonstration Reactor Program in
September 2022. This program has three phases:

Phase Content                Date

Phase A Preliminary concept review Completed February 2023
Phase B Basic design         Scheduled to complete by March 2025
Phase C Licensing, construction, and operation Start in the early 2030s

In July 2023, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) selected a
team for Phase B's contractors, comprising the UK National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL)
and the JAEA as one of them. NNL and JAEA will conduct the basic design of an
efficient heat-utilizing UK HTGR Demonstration Reactor, including hydrogen
production or steam use.

During Phase B, DESNZ announced the start of a fuel development program for the
HTGR Demonstration Reactor. It selected NNL as the contractor in July 2023. JAEA,
along with Nuclear Fuel Industries, will collaborate with NNL. The goal is to establish
commercial-scale fuel manufacturing technology in the UK, and will be based on
Japan’s HTGR fuel design and manufacturing technology. Technology transfer will
involve concluding technology and license agreements, making UK-produced HTGR
fuel one of the procurement options for domestic HTGR demo reactors.

Poland plans to use HTGR as a heat source for the chemical industry. It will thus
replace coal-fired power to achieve decarbonization and aims to introduce an HTGR
research reactor (thermal output of 30 MW) in the late 2020s. The National Center for
Nuclear Research (NCBJ) is in charge of advancing the HTGR research reactor design.
In September 2019, the JAEA signed a R&D agreement with the NCBJ.

Conclusion
Many of Japan’s industrial titans want the country to seize this opportunity in nuclear
power. A recent Nikkei survey of 100 Japanese executives showed how the majority
was in favor of restarting existing NPPs and building new ones. On the other hand, a
feeling of skepticism towards nuclear power persists among Japan’s population. The
government, however, is adamant in restarting nuclear power plants and having
nuclear power account for up to 22% of the national energy mix by 2030. While the
deadline is near, many plants are still idling.

Progressing with HTGR technology may bring a breath of fresh air to the nuclear
sector. Given its smaller size and boosting enhanced safety, as well as its potential for
producing hydrogen, HTGR may encounter less resistance compared to traditional
reactors.

HTGR, together with other new advanced reactor types and technologies such as
fusion and SMRs, may take a role in reshaping the future nuclear industry. The
possibility of producing hydrogen may also open a different possibility for nuclear
energy than the hardline, straightforward NPPs restart approach.

This can happen only if the HTGR reaches a commercialization phase, which still
seems very distant. What’s more, it must prove its commercial viability. To beat the
competition with the CO2 hydrogen production method, it cannot rely on its own
forces alone, but it needs the help of state measures such as carbon pricing and
carbon tax.

Solving Logistics Barriers: Transport Solutions for Wind Farm Components

Japan’s ambitious plans to build a sizable and competitive offshore wind power sector
largely rely on scaling up turbines in local projects. Yet, it is the construction and
installation technologies that will likely determine whether the sector succeeds, and
which companies race ahead.

The logistics of assembling wind power generation components, moving them to the
location of the wind farm, and then assembling facilities, can account for as much as
half of total offshore wind project costs. In Japan, the numbers tend to be at the
higher end of the range due to a dearth of domestic component transportation
options on land and sea, as well as lagging port infrastructure. As a result, many local
developers are scrambling to find ways to cut both capital, operating and future
decommissioning expenses.

Japan’s obvious need to accelerate wind sector supply chain development has
created opportunities for a number of European firms with tech solutions tested in
their regional markets. Although Japan has exemplary logistics and transport networks
for consumer retail, domestic firms have been slow to move into the offshore wind
space.

By the early 2030s, Japan seeks to operate 10 GW of offshore wind capacity. For
onshore wind, expectations are even higher – as much as 26 GW installed nationwide.
Many of these projects are still on the design board or in early stages of development,
with delivery of electricity scheduled from 2028 on out. But in terms of project
management, this means solutions are needed today.


Installation woes
Industrial wind turbines are massive pieces of high-tech that require sophisticated
equipment to transport them from manufacturing facilities to hubs or ports for final
assembly, and then from there they’re delivered to final designated sites. The typical
three-blade wind turbine consists of a tower, nacelle, rotor, and three blades spanning
up to 100 meters.

Japan’s most widely used turbines are made by General Electric, and Siemens
Gamesa Renewable Energy. Vestas’ 4.2 MW turbine is also used in large-scale
projects; it has a tower ranging between 105 and 166 meters high, blades spanning
76 meters, and nacelles measuring almost 13 meters. Each blade can weigh up to 70
metric tons. Needless to say, moving these parts is a challenge.

Technological innovations in wind power generation are proving to be a double-
edged sword. While increasing wind turbine component size helps to boost capacity,
it also negatively impacts the lifting, loading and transport of components. In
addition, Japan's specific topography with mountainous terrain and narrow roads, as
well as local transport regulations, further compounds logistical challenges.

In fact, increasing turbine size will play only a partial role in Japan’s efforts to reduce
the cost of electricity produced by offshore wind farms, according to a 2023 study by
academics Kikuchi Yuka and Ishihara Takeshi at the University of Tokyo’s School of
Engineering.

In an article published in Applied Energy 341 (2023), the two academics used data
from some of Japan’s tops engineering firms and reviewed the development of the
UK’s offshore wind sector to conclude that domestic projects will need to rely as much
on efficiencies from the construction and operations and management (O&M) phases
as on bigger turbines to help meet the government’s levelized cost of electricity goals
for the sector.









Source: Applied Energy 341 (2023), Y. Kikuchi and T. Ishihara

Moving to bigger turbines also brings its own challenges. As wind farm operators
move towards using turbines with a capacity of up to 15 MW or more, standard
transporters are often too small or are not suitable to carry heavy components
measuring several dozen meters in length. Even for a typical 1.5 MW turbine, you can
expect a blade length between 35 and 45 meters. While such a size is manageable for
transport, larger units require more specialized trucks.

To address this, construction companies and developers in Japan are looking to
markets with more advanced wind power sectors for inspiration. They’re adopting
innovative solutions, such as blade transporters offered by Belgian firm Faymonville,
whose lifters can transport blades either horizontally and vertically. This is useful in
hilly areas. The lifter rotates on its own axis and can swivel to the side.

In 2016, Faymonville entered the Japanese market, and now offers a range of loaders,
flatbed trailers, modular and other types of 6-axle, 4-axle and 2-axle trailers and semi-
trailers for special or heavy transport. Clients include Nippon Express, Japan’s leading
firm in the transport sector.


Faymonville also offers low-bed trailers to transport other components like nacelles or
towers. The vehicles have floors that can widen or lower in accordance to the
component height and size when passing through tunnels or under bridges, or
through other narrow and uneven areas.

The Belgian firm says that Japan tops the list of countries conducting tests using its
latest trailers for wind projects. This year, the seventh of its bladelifter trailers was set
to be delivered to Japan.

Trailers with flexible blade lifters also enable project operators to avoid additional
pricing levied by law for the use of properties adjacent to the road in case the
25

transported cargo even slightly crosses over such an area, as well as the cost of
chopping down trees to make way for the trucks to sites in remote areas.

Problems at the sites
Advanced tech solutions for moving components, however, won’t address potential
problems at sites where turbines are assembled or from where they are, for instance,
transported offshore. Challenges in port logistics range from the lack of space for
assembly to approval of such work by local fisheries and other special interest groups.

Many of those sites often have poor infrastructure unable to accommodate the large-
scale equipment used to assemble massive components, never mind the components
themselves. The problem is also due to the scarcity of land and regulatory constraints
in port areas. (In a separate article, Japan NRG will focus on the challenges at port
areas and their use for wind power generation projects.)

Another innovative solution comes from Heavy Duty Pavements, a Dutch consulting
firm, which offers “soil stabilization solutions” – upgrades of ground bearing capacity
at project sites. This enables project operators to quickly strengthen the ground for
assembly or transportation of components.

While not yet available in Japan, the firm’s solution enhances the load bearing
capacity of the soil up to required ground bearing pressure. During a recent energy
trade show in Tokyo, the firm demonstrated its so-called Enviro-Mat additive, which
enhances cement by lengthening its crystals, creating a more durable bond.


The company claims that its technology increases safety and is cost efficient as the
reinforced layer can be quickly installed and removed. It also makes the ground
resistant to water and freeze-thaw damage, making it suitable even for harsh climate
conditions.

This is important because several offshore wind farm sites are near Hokkaido, which is
surrounded by the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. In winter,
these areas can face heavy snows with temperatures below freezing.

With more than 10 offshore, onshore and near-onshore wind power projects in the
pipeline, Japan is faced with an opportunity to invest in more advanced technologies
to address logistical challenges in the wind power industry. Their innovative solutions
will become crucial with further advancement of wind turbine technology in Japan.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Data centers
Due to the growth of AI, the country needs 3.3 to 5 GW of additional capacity by
2030, or about 15% of the current total load, according to UBS. Data centers now
account for almost 25% of large industrial power demand in Australia. UBS forecasts
that load will increase by 16% annually through 2030.

China / Vehicles
The number of motor vehicles reached 440 million, including 345 million cars and
24.72 million new energy vehicles.

China / Power grid
Through 2030, the electricity grid will invest more than $800 billion to upgrade. The
aging grid is a major constraint for China’s energy transition. During the first four
months of 2024, China invested $17 billion in power grid projects, a 25% YoY
increase.

China / Solar power
The Industry Ministry issued rules tightening investment regulations for solar PV
projects. They’ll need to have a minimum capital ratio of 30% with the new rules.
Previously, the minimum for PV projects was 20%.

India / Coking coal
This month, India will import coking coal from Mongolia on a trial basis. India seeks to
diversify imports of the steelmaking raw material to mitigate over-reliance on
Australia.

India / Hydropower
India plans to spend $1 billion to expedite the construction of 12 hydropower stations
in the Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh. This could raise tensions with China that
also lays claims to the region.

India / Pumped storage
The country’s pumped storage capacity is expected to reach about 55 GW by 2031,
up from the current 4.7 GW, said the Ministry of Power. India has around 2.5 GW of
pumped storage capacity under construction. Around 50 GW of other similar projects
are under different stages of development.

Pakistan / Power prices
Amid rising power prices, consumption of electricity from the national grid fell 10% in
FY2023. This exacerbates problems in the crisis-ridden electricity sector, which is
straining under $8.3 billion of debt, much of it owed to Chinese energy producers.

Southeast Asia / Natural gas
Offshore gas production in the region has a $100 billion potential, driven by many
FIDs expected to materialize by 2028, says Rystad Energy. This is a more than twofold
increase over the $45 billion in developments that reached FID from 2014 to 2023.

Vietnam / Solar power
A new rule could unleash a surge in solar and wind energy, where companies from
Apple to H&M hope to switch their supply chains to renewable power. Under the so-
called Decree 80 issued last week, Vietnam now allows businesses to buy renewable
energy from producers instead of relying on state monopoly Vietnam Electricity.
