METI plans to drop FIT price for solar to ¥9.5 within one year
(Nikkei, Jan. 28)
•  METI plans to set the feed-in tariff (FIT) for utility solar at ¥9.5/ kWh in FY2023, down ¥0.5 from ¥10
set for FY2022. This will be the first time for the FIT to drop into single digits as the govt. seeks to
encourage price competition.
•  At its latest meeting, the Committee for Calculating the Procurement Price approved the draft of

the purchase price for renewable energy by power source for FY2023. A formal decision will be
made by the end of March.
•  In FY2023, the price for residential solar power of less than 10 kW capacity will be reduced by ¥1,
to ¥16.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Environment Minister calls for radical reform of solar assessment process

(NHK, Jan. 25)
o  Environment Minister Yamaguchi wants radical reform of the environmental assessment
process used to vet large solar projects.
o  He said some renewable energy operators fail to inform communities about their solar
farms, resulting in hostility.
o  The government will crack down on operators that don’t consider the environmental
impact of their farms.

o  Land-grading performed on solar farm sites commonly requires depositing a large
volume of loose soil, creating the risk of landslides.



METI estimates 480 CCS sites needed by 2050
(Nikkei, Jan. 28)
•  METI held its first discussion for a timeline to rollout underground carbon capture and storage

(CCS) technology. METI estimates 240 million tons of CO2 will be stored per year by 2050,
requiring 480 sites.
•  The cost of drilling to create the storage is estimated at over ¥2.4 trillion. METI wants to establish a
business environment for the technology as soon as possible.
•  Each CCS site may hold about 0.5 million tons, according to METI, which supervised Japan's first
large-scale test of CCS in Tomakomai City, Hokkaido.
•  CCS is far from commercialized in Japan; METI hopes to reach this by FY2030. Drilling cost for one

land site is estimated at ¥5 billion; in the ocean at ¥8 billion.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JOGMEC publishes guidelines on how to calculate CO2 emission cuts for carbon capture
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 26)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) has developed and
published two sets of draft guidelines for calculating CO2 emission reductions in CO2
capture and storage (CCS) projects, and LNG, hydrogen and ammonia production
projects.
o  The first guideline integrates everything from CO2 sequestration to CO2 emission

reductions into a single document. The second one, on "GHG Emissions from LNG,
Hydrogen, and Ammonia Production," integrates multiple international standards and
initiatives into a single consistent approach.
o  Both guidelines are intended for use in JOGMEC's various operations.
o  CONTEXT: JOGMEC is the state-backed investor in many new Japanese energy projects,
especially those at an early stage. Meanwhile, there are no common international

standards for CCS projects and there are discrepancies over how to calculate the CO2
emissions associated with LNG cargos.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JOGMEC to participate in Australia CCS project, CarbonNet
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 28)
o  The CCS project is planned in Victoria, Australia. JOGMEC will contribute to the FEED
(basic design) of the CCS project to be implemented by the local government, and

promote the project’s commercialization.
o  The project aims to remove 5 million tons of CO2 a year for 25 years.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JFE Engineering ties up with Ishii Iron Works to win carbon capture projects
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 28)
o  The two firms aim to win more orders for CCS facilities as well as receiving and storage

facilities for ammonia and hydrogen.



METI considers negative emission tech outside of carbon storage

(Japan NRG, Jan. 21)
•  METI plans to review the potential of negative emission technologies that can best leverage
Japan’s geographical features and doesn’t require carbon storage space. They are: biochar,
forestation, development of “super trees” that absorb more carbon, and enhanced rock
weathering that can take advantage of forest resources.
•  Technologies that can optimize ocean resources are: soil carbon sequestration, and alkalinization in

biomass released into the seas. Direct carbon capture (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture
and storage (BECCS) are the main negative emission technologies in Western countries but they
require massive storage space, which may not be suitable for Japan, a representative from NEDO
told a METI panel on green innovation strategy.
• TAKEAWAY: Views on Japan’s CCS potentials are divided. Some argue Japan has land space constraints and
that offshore CCS will take time to develop, but others say Japan has storage potential of several billion tons.
CCS, if developed, will primarily be used to store carbon from power generation. The METI scenario is to store

10% of carbon from power stations in CCS in 2050.

METI to establish methanation carbon tracing task force by March 2022
(Japan NRG, Jan. 24)
•  METI will launch a task force by March to establish measurement, reporting and verification
methodology to assess carbon emissions in the methanation process, which recycles carbon into

fuel called synthetic methane, by reacting carbon with hydrogen.
•  The task force aims to share its methodology and relevant guidelines internationally in order to be
recognized by the IPCC and the GHG inventory methodology as a new approach to reduce
carbon, to generate offset credits, and to be accounted for nationally determined contributions
(NDC).
•  The task force will be comprised of four engineering and decarbonization experts.
•  CONTEXT: Five gas operators (Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas, Shizuoka Gas, and Seibu Gas)

plan pilot methanation projects with a combined capacity of around 2,000 NM3/h.
• TAKEAWAY: Methanation plants will require electricity. The availability of green hydrogen and low-cost
renewable power will be the key to establishing this as a clean source of energy. Although Japan has abundant
carbon from steel and other industrial plants, deploying the technology overseas may be a good option
initially due to better availability of green hydrogen and cheaper renewables.




Government sets targets for sustainable aviation fuel
(Jiji, Jan. 25)
•  The government wants targets for sustainable aviation fuel production. By 2030, 10% of fuel used
by Japanese airlines must be sustainable.
•  A government/private sector committee will be set up to include officials from METI, the Ministry

of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, fuel manufacturers, and airlines.
•  While sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of global demand, aviation is a
carbon-intensive form of transport, so the transition to sustainable fuel has the potential to
significantly reduce carbon emissions.



METI discussing EV battery recycling scheme

(Jiji, Jan. 21)
•  METI wants to create a plan for recycling EV batteries.
•  It would require manufacturers to calculate the lifetime CO2 footprint of their batteries from
procurement to disposal.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI to set energy conservation targets for data centers starting in FY2022

(Nikkei, Jan. 29)
o  Companies with bases in Japan will be eligible, and large companies will be required to
receive subsidies to support the introduction of energy-saving equipment. The amount of
data is increasing due to digitization, and the power consumption of data centers is
rapidly expanding.

New law to open electricity grid to battery storage
(Nikkei, Jan. 27)
•  As part of a package to support generators of renewable energy, METI is preparing legislation to
force operators of transmission lines to allow storage batteries to feed the grid if the battery owner
requests.
•  The package also includes subsidies, as much as 50%, for purchases of storage batteries by

renewable generators. The government earmarked ¥13 billion for storage batteries in its
supplemental 2021/22 budget.
•  Previously, ambiguity around the legal status of storage batteries meant prospective battery
owners feared they might be denied grid access.
•  The govt could order releasing stored power in time of electricity shortages. The changes will be
submitted to the current parliamentary session.
• TAKEAWAY: This could be one of the single most important developments in the power grid this decade. The

technology is not yet there in Japan to make batteries a significant part of the power system, but with Tesla
and Huawei making early moves to seize the market and domestic battery makers keen to be involved it’s a
sector that will likely grow in leaps and bounds, also paving the way for a stronger VPP and other energy
management tools.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO sets up battery unit to expand the business
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 28)
o  Tokyo Electric will establish a new "Storage Battery Business Office" as an organization
to spread storage batteries in Japan and to promote the storage battery business. The

Government says risk of summer power shortage is easing
(Japan NRG, Jan. 25)
•  Power shortages during the peak summer demand season from July to September this year will
ease with the restart of the 1 GW Taketoyo-5 coal power plant (JERA) on Aug. 5, METI said.
•  The power reserve rate for Tokyo, Chubu and other five areas were forecast to dip below the 3%

minimal threshold, but with the Taketoyo restart and more solar power volumes expected the rate
is now seen holding above 3%.
•  Power shortages might prevail in winter of 2023, as the preliminary forecast shows Tokyo and
Chubu areas will have reserve rates of 0.9-2.6% over January-February of 2023. The final power
supply and demand forecast will be released in February at the earliest.

o  METI won’t include new capacities of integrated coal-gasification combined-cycle (IGCC)
power plants in Nakoso and Hirono in the national power supply plan for the next fiscal
year due to operational instabilities. The two IGCC plants, brought online last year,
suspended operations several times in the past months due to glitches in pumps and
other equipment.

o  The two have a combined capacity of 1.68 GW and their energy efficiencies are 46-50%.



ENEOS, TEPCO prepare to fight back in second wind tender
(Nikkei, Jan. 25)
•  ENEOS Holdings and TEPCO Holdings are among companies planning to participate in the

second round of tenders for offshore wind projects.
•  This time, the authorities are likely to focus on the competitiveness of tariff bids when allocating
contracts.
•  On Jan. 24, TEPCO informed a partner financial institution that it will rethink its strategy, because
half of its projected profits would be wiped out by trying to match Mitsubishi’s recent bid
(significantly below ¥20).
•  However, a source at a major turbine manufacturer believes the Mitsubishi consortium is certain to

win the upcoming tender.
•  Nishikawa Shusaku, senior analyst at Daiwa Securities, says the Mitsubishi consortium will use 134
GE turbines to build the projects in the first tender, and likely ordered even more GE turbines,
perhaps over 200. This would mean deep discounts, allowing the Mitsubishi consortium to make a
rock-bottom bid in the next round of tenders.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Mitsubishi bid opens Pandora’s box as fisheries complain of unfair treatment
(Diamond, Jan. 27)
o  Fishing cooperatives in Akita were angry to learn of the winning low tariff bid by
Mitsubishi Corp’s consortium in tenders to build offshore wind farms.
o  Under an agreement with local fisheries, the cooperatives will receive 0.5% of revenue
from electricity generated by wind farms over the next 20 years.
o  Had the winning operator bid the maximum allowable rate of ¥29/ kWh, the cooperatives

would receive nearly ¥11 billion over 20 years.
o  Instead, they will now receive a mere ¥4.6 billion.
o  In contrast, fisheries cooperatives in Chiba agreed to receive a flat rate of compensation
in relation to wind farm development (also undertaken by Mitsubishi) and stand to
receive nearly ¥12 billion over 20 years.
o  However, the low tariffs are good news for consumers, as levies added to power bills to
finance the FIT scheme will be lower.

• TAKEAWAY: As often noted in Japan NRG, the offshore wind tenders are not just an issue for the players in
that industry. Local governments and local interest groups have to have a strong buy-in – an issue METI has
often stressed. The fact that Mitsubishi offered different compensation schemes for different fishing
cooperatives shows that the schema for the offshore wind business model is still being trialed. This gives other
players a chance to be creative for the next tenders. It would be a big risk for the government to award the
next tender to the Mitsubishi-Chubu Electric alliance that won the three tenders last year.

Japan’s JAEA and Mitsubishi Heavy officially join Bill Gates-backed nuclear project

(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 27)
•  The Japan Atomic Energy Agency and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries officially announced their
participation in a nuclear project led by a U.S. startup co-founded by Bill Gates.
•  The Japanese side signed an MoU with TerraPower to help construct a 345-MW prototype plant in
the American state of Wyoming. The plant is due to come online in 2028 and is subsidized by the
U.S. Energy Department.
•  TerraPower's technology uses liquid sodium as a coolant in a fast neutron reactor. Mitsubishi

Heavy’s role is to help develop technology for swapping out fuel and equipment to detect fuel
failures.
•  CONTEXT: Fast neutron reactors create conditions to sustain fission chain reactions. Such a
process consumes plutonium fuel more efficiently and also transforms long-lived nuclear waste into
elements with shorter half-lives.
•  Unlike fast-breeder reactors, fast neutron reactors like TerraPower's do not produce more

plutonium to avoid the risk of proliferation.

Government to subsidize oil companies as gasoline hits ¥170
(Mainichi Shimbun, Jan. 25)
•  Head of METI Haguida Koichi said the govt. will subsidize oil companies.
•  The move comes in response to high gasoline prices, which recently surpassed ¥170 per liter for
the first time in over 13 years.
•  Oil companies will initially receive a subsidy of ¥3.4/ liter of gasoline sold.

•  The move is aimed at keeping gasoline prices down.
•  The move doesn’t go far enough, says the opposition, urging the government to reinstate a
scheme created in 2010 by the now defunct Democratic Party of Japan that reduced the gasoline
tax from ¥54/ liter to around ¥29/ liter whenever prices exceeded ¥160/ liter.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Service stations fear gasoline subsidy will breed confusion

(Jiji, Jan. 26)
o  The government’s decision to subsidize gasoline companies to offset high prices was met
with criticism from some service station owners.
o  They say that because service stations set prices based on sales and inventory volumes,
the subsidies might not affect the price at the pump.
o  Others expressed concern that drivers would assume the price of gasoline was now
capped at ¥170.

• TAKEAWAY: Although the cost of crude oil keeps rising, retail prices at the pump will drop by ¥0.9/ liter from
the last week of January thanks to the government subsidies. The three major oil refineries have all announced
a first notable price drop in months, affecting a broad range of petroleum products.
• Energy prices are a less sensitive election issue in Japan than, for example, in the U.S. However, the

government is concerned about energy price inflation spreading to food produce, which is an area that could
become top national news. With vital upper-house elections this summer, PM Kishida’s objective is to keep
dissatisfaction to a minimum.



Carbon neutral LNG spreads to 107 consumers

(Japan NRG, Jan. 24)
•  Carbon neutral LNG is quickly spreading among large consumers, to 107 companies from just a
handful a year ago, according to the Japan Gas Association. Among 107 users, 64 were
manufacturers.
•  Tokyo Gas started its supply in 2019. As of December last year, around 40 gas utilities were
supplying carbon neutral LNG. The gas is sourced from Australia, Malaysia and etc. The association

plans to write guidelines that will define the methodologies to measure, verify and price carbon
credits.

•  Outside the gas industry, oil refiner ENEOS, which has a gas retail license, started sales in
November 2021, and Hokuriku Electric Power this month.

Tokyo Gas to supply carbon-neutral gas to Juntendo University

(The Daily Engineering & Construction News, Jan. 28)
o  Juntendo University and Tokyo Gas will collaborate to supply carbon neutral gas to
campuses as well as to hospitals affiliated with the University. By switching to carbon
neutral gas, Juntendo will reduce CO2 emissions by around 6,500 metric tons per year.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan NRG was among the first to report the emergence of this niche in Japan and its potential
to grow. The debate over the environmental credentials of “carbon neutral” LNG and other fossil fuels
continues globally, but in Japan it has been seized upon as a manageable, near-term solution that the sellers

like to promote. We expect the sector to continue to grow but also develop in tandem with the upcoming
voluntary carbon market in Tokyo.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
OPINION: Divesting from Russian gas is not so simple
(Nikkei opinion, Jan. 25)
o  Japan, EU nations, and the U.S. are trying to reduce Russian gas consumption in the face

of U.S. sanctions and potential conflict in Ukraine. Easier said than done, however,
especially in the EU, which depends on Russia for 47% of its gas needs.
o  Meanwhile, China’s gas consumption is increasing, and Russia hopes to sell more gas to
Beijing; thus giving the U.S. less leverage over Moscow.

SAKI ISETANI

The Battle to Reduce Japan’s Methane Emissions by 2030

Agricultural Sector Leads the Charge

For the past several decades, Japanese farmers have struggled with the effects of
climate change, forced to alter planting and harvesting schedules to avoid typhoons.
But now, the country’s farmers are going on the offensive, taking action to help slow
climate change by cutting the agriculture sector’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Methane is a major GHG in the agricultural sector. Japan’s methane release was 28.2
million CO2 equivalent tons in FY2020, with the agriculture sector accounting for 21.9
million tons of methane, or 78% of the nation’s total.

While most attention in climate conversations have centered on CO2, the potency of
methane and its potential to cause even greater damage to the environment brought
it more attention in the last year. During her opening remarks at COP26, EU
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that methane reduction was the
“lowest-hanging fruit”. That is, methane has a stronger warming effect on the
atmosphere compared to a single molecule of CO2, and its reduction is a quick and
easy way to reach the Paris Agreement global warming targets.

Two months before COP26, the U.S., and the EU initiated the “Global Methane
Pledge” to cut global methane emissions 30% by 2030, over 2020 levels. Including
Japan, 103 countries signed the pledge during COP26. However, the three top
emitters China, Russia, and India didn’t sign, seriously weakening the initiative.

On a global level, Japan’s role in the methane emissions equation is minor,
comprising 0.3% of the total. The U.S., the world’s fourth largest methane polluter,
emits more methane by a factor of 23. Still, the solutions that Japan pioneers to cut
emissions could be applied in many other countries, especially in Asia. On a global
scale, methane emissions are up 262% from pre-industrialization levels, at 9,390
million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020, according to the Global Methane Initiative.

Two steps forward, one step back
Japan has managed to reduce methane emissions 12% in the decade to 2020, owing
to industrial waste treatment and other sectors, except agriculture. But agriculture-
driven methane emissions have increased at the expense of cuts in other sectors,
rising for three years in a row since 2018.

The biggest culprits are at the core of the nation’s diet: rice cultivation and cattle
farming. To tackle their associated emissions, Japan is pursuing technology and
methods that promise to cut methane volumes by 10-30%.

Of the 21.9 million tons in Japan’s methane emissions, roughly 50% come from rice
fields, and 45% from livestock belching and manure.

Part I: Reducing Rice-Driven Methane

Rice is Japan’s main crop, covering half of arable land, and the country is the world’s
10th largest rice producer, with annual production of 7.8 million tons. In 2019, the
Japanese rice sector generated 11.9 million tons of methane from 2.4 million hectares
of paddy fields.

Data from the Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Science (JIRCAS)
shows that methane accounts for 50% of rice field GHGs. Although the area of rice
farming decreased 4% in the last 10 years, methane emissions held stable at around
12 million tons/ year.

Methane is generated when farmers flood rice fields, precipitating a drop in oxygen
levels, allowing microorganisms in the soil to flourish and produce large amounts of
methane. Proper water management in the paddy fields is key to controlling methane.
Mid-summer drainage (MSD), a traditional Japanese farming technique, reduces
methane and temporarily removes irrigation water, typically for two to three weeks in
June-July, before the rice heading date, causing the soil surface to crack.

Soil aeration lets oxygen enter the roots, suppressing the activity of methanogens, the
bacteria that produce methane. If implemented at the right timing and duration, the
technique can reduce methane volumes by up to 30%. In the image below, the
diagram on the left shows a rice field without MSD. The water causes oxygen to
decrease, allowing methanogens to increase. In the other diagram, on the right, water
drainage allows oxygen to be supplied to the soil, decreasing the methanogens.

The Agriculture Research Center in Fukushima was the first to study MSD’s impact on
methane generation. Research showed that extending the period of MSD by one
week led to a reduction in methane levels without impacting the crops.

To see if this could be applied to regions with varying soil types and climate, the
National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO) held a pilot in eight
prefectures across Japan. The study showed that extending the mid-drainage period

Underground water level control system
Meanwhile, the Niigata Prefecture has a new initiative to reduce methane emissions
from rice fields. Known as the “underground water level control system”, the local
government is currently researching its application for methane reduction. The system
uses an Alternate Wetting and Drying (AMD) mechanism to reduce methane without
negative impact on rice production yield and quality.

The system adjusts the water level in the soil by supplying and draining the water
through pipes that run the entire paddy field. This system significantly reduces
drainage time, which is key. A Meiji University study shows that underground water
irrigation can reduce methane generation by about 30% compared to surface
irrigation.

The “underground water piping system” was originally developed for increasing crop
volume. The pipe that runs through the system helps to improve drainage, making it
easier to manage water flow and improve work efficiency. Niigata is the country’s
number one rice producing region, and if the technology is successfully implemented
then it can be a big step in reducing methane. Niigata’s rice fields cover 119,200 ha,
or 8% of the country’s total.

Part II: Tackling Methane from Cattle

Out of the global total of 1.5 billion, the Japanese cattle population is about 4 million,
but they account for over 75% of Japanese livestock methane emissions - 9.9 million
tons. Cattle are responsible for 7.5 million tons of methane from belching. Other
major belchers – sheep and goats — are negligible in Japan. Cattle release over 45
million tons per year of manure, accounting for over 56% of domestic animal manure.

Cattle release methane while digesting food, and in Japan their average daily
emission is 300-600 liters of methane, after eating 10-20 kg of feed. Dairy cows
consume more feed and release more methane than beef cattle. Around 35% of
Japanese cows are dairy, mostly Holstein Friesians originally from Europe.


Killing several birds with one stone
There are two approaches to cutting cattle methane: through improved feed and
breeding. In Japan, the focus has been on developing new feeds with various
functions. Apart from being healthy and nutritious, the feed provides protection from
diseases and improves nutrient absorption.

In 2021, Japan had 55,900 dairy and beef farms, down 29% from 2013. These farms
were short-handed and many closed due to an aging workforce. But feed
manufacturers had to sell new products to increase their share in the shrinking market.

For decades, fatty acids were mixed with corn, soy beans and other feeds to improve
digestion and speed up growth. The hydrogen in the cow’s stomach combines with
fatty acids and cuts methane gas generation. This type of feed was generally
marketed to improve health and growth rates, and was not labeled as methane-
reducing.

According to pioneering food company Nichirei Corporation, which gives cattle a diet
rich in fatty acids, the feed cuts methane gas by 10%. It also improves digestion,
shortening the growth period and reducing feed costs.

In 2011, oil refiner Idemitsu launched Ruminap, a cashew nut shell liquid-based
compound feed that cuts methane release by up to 20%. Research shows that
coconut oil, cashew nut oil, apple acid, oleic acid, and ginkgo nut have methane
reduction effects. In 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF)
launched a subsidy program for cattle farms that use feed containing non-saturated
fatty acid and calcium. As a result, inquiries for methane reduction feed increased, and
some feed-makers shifted ingredients to non-saturated fatty acids from fatty acids.

The MAFF-led methane cutting initiative, however, has seen limited success due to
the subsidy design. The money is provided to farms that directly deal with the feed
manufacturers. “Feed brokers and traders were left out of the system, and as a result,
only those that directly deal with the suppliers or advisors from the government know
about it,“ one broker told NRG.

Another broker, however, argued that functional feeds are not made for mass
marketing. Farmers need to try new feeds cautiously, monitoring the animal reactions.
There’s no one-for-all solution. In the search for better solutions, Hokkaido University
launched a program in 2021 to develop a revolutionary feed by 2050 that cuts dairy
cow methane emission by 80%, while increasing milk production by 10%.











Conclusion
The 2030 agriculture sectoral goal is to cut 0.64-2.43 million tons of methane from the
2013 level of 22.2 million tons. In reducing carbon emissions in paddy fields,
Japanese farmers prefer a more traditional approach, such as the application of Mid-
summer drainage, a traditional farming method to reduce methane emissions.

For paddy fields, implementing techniques that maintain the quality of rice while
achieving methane reduction is a top priority. In animal husbandry, the MAFF subsidy
program encourages feed manufacturers and farmers to try new diets, but
breakthrough solutions are yet to be found.

The planned 10-30% methane cuts, however, might not be ambitious enough to
achieve Japan’s commitment to reduce methane 30% by 2030. The country needs to
take bolder steps in the regulatory, policy and business fronts.

Motivation to do so might come from possible opportunities for Japanese businesses
to apply these technologies and methods overseas. Idemitsu's Ruminap is already
exported to Asian countries. Japanese rice farming techniques could potentially
spread to elsewhere in Asia – China, Vietnam and India – and this could be a major
factor in efforts to mitigate the effects of global climate change.

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ EV sales
In 2021, EV sales rose 154% YoY, to 3.3 million vehicles. Beijing aims for NEVs,
including plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell cars, to account for 20% of total car
sales by 2025; all internal combustion engine sales will be banned by 2035.

China/ Solar power
In 2021, distributed PV installations accounted for 29 GW of capacity, the first time
such a figure exceeded more than 50% of the annual total (53 GW) of grid-connected
solar capacity. This is a 10% rise over 2020’s total of 48.2 GW installed capacity.

Energy transition
In 2021, a record $755 billion was invested globally in the energy transition, a 27%
rise over 2020, said BloombergNEF. Renewable energy garnered a record $366
billion, up 6.5%, while electrified transport, which includes EVs and related
infrastructure, secured $273 billion. EV sales rose 77%. Only carbon capture and
storage recorded a small decrease in investment.

Germany/ Wind power
New government plans call for building as much as 10 GW of onshore wind capacity
each year until 2030. Also, the country’s offshore wind target rose to 30 GW by 2030.
By comparison, Europe as a whole installed 11.8 GW of onshore wind in 2020.

Oman/ Solar power
The 500 MW Ibri 2 solar plant opened. The project is led by Saudi Arabia’s ACWA
Power, which invested $417 million in the 1.5 million-panel plant. It will sell electricity
to state-owned Oman Power and Water Procurement Company in a 15-year contract.

Scandinavia/ Wind power
Thanks to stormy weather across the region, wind power production in Nordic
countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland) hit a record high of 21.3 GW,
according to Refinitiv Eikon. The previous record, set only last week, was 20.8 GW.

South Korea/ EV batteries
LG’s battery business set a record as the largest IPO in South Korean history. The
$10.8 billion IPO gives the company a roughly $70 billion valuation, making it South
Korea’s third largest company. A record 4.4 million retail investors placed $96 billion
in bids.

Spain/ Hydrogen power
A consortium of 33 companies led by Spanish oil giant Repsol will invest €3.23 billion
to promote hydrogen technologies and install 500 MW of green H2 capacity by 2025,
and 2GW by 2030. This will account for half of the Spanish government's 4 GW target.

Sweden/ Pink hydrogen
The Oskarshamn 3 nuclear facility, operated by a company owned by Uniper and
Fortum, will soon start supplying ‘pink’ hydrogen to engineering and gas giant, Linde
Gas, which will use the fuel "in the green transition of Swedish industry”. Uniper said
its “ambition is to develop the growing market for hydrogen together with Fortum.”

UK/ Battery storage
Canadian company Amp Energy will build a battery portfolio in Scotland, to be
operational in April 2024. It will have two 400 MW battery facilities, each providing
800 MW hours of energy storage capacity. The batteries will be the two largest of
their kind in Europe.

U.S./ Natural gas
As part of the greater trend toward consolidation of the U.S. shale gas industry,
Chesapeake Energy will spend $2.6 billion to buy Chief Oil & Gas. In 2021, there were
$66 billion worth of such transactions in the industry in the wake of the Covid-induced
energy crash.

U.S./ Nuclear power
Completing Georgia Power Company’s Plant Vogtle has doubled in cost to $30
billion; both units are six years behind schedule, said the Institute for Energy
Economics and Financial Analysis. Cost overruns and “unreasonable construction
schedules” are to blame.
