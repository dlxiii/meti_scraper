Panasonic and green tech suppliers seek to create "avoided emissions" standards

(Nikkei Asia, June 17)
•  Panasonic is pushing for international standards to calculate "avoided emissions". This means
measuring GHGs prevented by adopting a specific clean energy product or service.
•  Panasonic supplies EV batteries to Tesla. Advocates of the new standards include Panasonic and
the Japan Electrical Manufacturers' Association (JEMA). They seek adoption by the end of FY2024.
•  The standards must be transparent and coherent in calculation. And third-party verification will be
needed.

•  CONTEXT: "Avoided emissions" are not included in Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions. The proposed
method will instead include suppliers' role in reducing emissions. This is important for
manufacturers of EV components and energy-saving technologies. The International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is discussing global standards.
• TAKEAWAY: Panasonic defines "avoided emissions'' as the reduction in CO2 emissions achieved outside of
the value chain. This is possible using energy-saving products and digital technologies. In FY2023 Panasonic
said it achieved 37 million tons of avoided emissions across 49 businesses. This was up from 23.5 million tons

in FY2021. Contributing products include EV rechargeable batteries, energy-efficient air conditioners and
lighting systems. Panasonic aims to achieve 93 million tons of avoided emissions by FY2031.




METI proposes strategy to expand DAC market at home and overseas
(Denki Shimbun, June 17)
•  METI’s DAC Working Group proposed a strategy to jumpstart markets for Direct Air Capture
(DAC), a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere.
•  The proposal includes promoting demos using suitable sites overseas and investment in R&D,

while also evaluating domestic potential and the use of renewables to power DAC. Sites with CO2
storage potential are seen as most suitable for early-stage commercialization.
•  With current technology, CO2 capture requires a large amount of energy, so the ministry wants to
focus the R&D to find innovative energy-saving, low-cost technologies.
•  The govt will consider expanding the use of the J-Credit system in DAC projects that certifies GHG
reductions as credits.
•  CONTEXT: DAC was first proposed in 1999. Currently, 18 DAC facilities are in operation in the

U.S., Canada, and Europe, but most are small-scale. The largest DAC plant is in Iceland, capturing
4,000 tCO2/ year for storage in basaltic formations. The IEA says that DAC will be a key
technology in the fight against climate change, but it faces challenges like low technology
readiness levels and scarce investment. The U.S. Department of Energy is funding four regional
DAC hubs with seed money.

impact of increased energy consumption in summer.
•  The govt plans to subsidize energy bills from August to October.




Green hydrogen network could supply state-backed semiconductor plant in 2030

(Nikkei, Denki Shimbun, June 17-18)
•  Mitsubishi Corp is leading a group of companies, including Hokkaido Electric and Air Water, to
conduct a feasibility study on building a renewable energy network with green hydrogen in Chitose
(Hokkaido).
•  By 2023, they plan to provide 3,000 tons of hydrogen a year to New Chitose Airport and the
Rapidus semiconductor plant under construction nearby.
•  The plant and associated factories could use the gas in production as a clean substitute for ‘gray’
hydrogen derived from fossil fuels.

•  Hokkaido Electric would be in charge of providing the renewable energy to power the electrolyser.
Takasago Thermal Engineering would be in charge of hydrogen production, and the Hokkaido unit
of Air Water would handle transport.
•  ANRE is partially subsidizing the feasibility study.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Sapporo City to launch hydrogen production startup

(Nikkei, June 19)
o  Sapporo together with Hokkaido Gas, Hokkaido Electric and Air Water, will launch a new
company for the manufacture and sale of hydrogen.
o  The city will provide more details to the local assembly when it convenes Sept 18.
o  The city also plans to update the Hydrogen Utilization Principles.
o  CONTEXT: This month, Sapporo became a deregulated zone to attract foreign
investment into hydrogen-focused green transformation businesses.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kose plans to use green hydrogen as heat source
(Company statement, June 14)
o  Kose plans to use green hydrogen as a heat source for its cosmetics manufacturing plant
to be built in the city of Minami-Alps (Yamanashi Pref).
o  The plant is expected to launch in 2026.




Japan, South Korea to launch three hydrogen working groups
(Government statement, June 14)
•  Japan and South Korea held the inaugural hydrogen/ ammonia cooperation dialog in Seoul, and

agreed to set up working groups on carbon intensity and its certification, synchronizing the
standardization of mobility and other areas, as well as safety issues related to hydrogen and other
materials.
5



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The govt and private sector will participate.
•  CONTEXT: In February 2024, Japan and South Korea agreed to launch a dialog on hydrogen and
ammonia. Top-ranking officials with direct oversight on hydrogen and ammonia issues are
participating. Aside from ANRE and the South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, 11
organizations participated in the inaugural meeting.

• TAKEAWAY: Japanese-South Korean cooperation has just started and no joint statement was issued at the
meeting. To compare, Japan’s hydrogen cooperation framework with the EU goes back to 2021 and is more
robust. But their cooperation on ammonia is limited to study of its potential as a hydrogen carrier. The Japan-
South Korean dialog will likely address broader ammonia related issues.




Mitsubishi HC Capital explores green hydrogen production
(Company statement, June 21)
•  Mitsubishi HC Capital, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI), and Nextems

will begin feasibility studies to produce green hydrogen in Miyako Island in Okinawa pref in 2026.
•  Miyako-jima Mirai Energy, a joint venture between Mitsubishi HC Capital and Nextems, will supply
solar power for green hydrogen production.
•  The companies will study the possibility of hydrogen purchase agreements (HPA) with the hotel
and resort facilities on the island.
•  CONTEXT: If realized, this would be the country’s first on-site green hydrogen supply business.
The island is not connected to the grid and the two thermal power stations on the island are the

main power sources. The island’s renewables capacity is 48 MW and this could possibly double
with increases in rooftop solar installations.
• TAKEAWAY: Excess renewables power generation during peak sunshine hours could potentially be utilized for
hydrogen production. However, the cost and scale of attempting such a system would be considerable. It will
be interesting to see if this kind of power system can work on a microgrid / small-island scale.




Toyofuji and Mitsubishi to build Japan’s first domestic methanol-fueled car carriers

(Company statement, June 18)
•  Toyofuji Shipping inked a deal with Mitsubishi Shipbuilding to build two domestic car carriers that
use methanol as primary fuel.
•  They’ll be completed in FY2027 and will be the first domestic car carriers to use methanol as the
main fuel.
•  The MoE and MLIT selected the project for the "FY2024 Maritime Sector Decarbonization
Promotion Project".
•  CONTEXT: Methanol fuel can reduce CO2 emissions by over 10% compared to traditional heavy

oil and has high storage efficiency.

Canon to begin sample shipments of protective material for PSCs
(Company statement, June 18)
•  Canon has developed a protective material for perovskite solar cells (PSC). It will begin a sample
shipment this month and plans to commercialize it in 2025.
•  The material is made of gallium phthalocyanine hydroxide, and is placed over the cell’s halide

perovskite layer. This prevents ions from moving outside the perovskite layer and creates hollow
spaces in the layer, which affects durability and performance.
•  The material will improve cell endurance and allow stable mass production of cell modules with
large surface areas.


















•  CONTEXT: The perovskite layer is vulnerable to moisture, heat, oxygen, etc., which can cause low
power efficiency and short life cycles. Glass and thin films have been used as protective materials,

but glass made the modules less flexible, while thin films were costly - over ¥100,000/ square
meter, according to one researcher. Other approaches include passivation, which is eliminating the
defects of the grains in the perovskite layer, pre-treating or post-treating the layer, etc.
• TAKEAWAY: Recently, various efficiency and durability solutions have emerged: Sekisui Chemical and Moresco
developed protective sealing technologies; and Mitsubishi Chemical Group developed a “universal”
passivation method, etc. But Canon is the first to announce its plan to mass produce its material in 2025, at the
time when Sekisui Chemical brings onstream the country’s first commercial PSC production site. Canon is likely

to achieve the PSC material production cost that meets METI’s cost target of ¥14/ kWh or less.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ENEOS to double iodine production on perovskite demand

(Nikkei, June 17)
o  ENEOS Holdings plans to double iodine production in Niigata prefecture to 440 tons /
year in the next five years on perovskite demand.
o  The company plans to invest over ¥10 billion for the expansion.

REI says Japan won’t need fossil fuels to ensure stable power supply in 2035
(Organization statement, June 19)
•  In a new report, the Renewable Energy Institute said that by 2035 Japan will be able to ensure
stable power supply even with 80% of its electricity coming from renewable energy sources.
•  REI says the key to achieving decarbonization, low-cost, and stable supply is the mass introduction

of solar power, wind power, and storage batteries. The institute is against Japan relying on nuclear
power or coal, which it says are not needed.
•  REI says that Japan can reduce CO2 emissions 66% by 2035, compared to 2019 levels, without
compromising the global competitiveness of its domestic industry.
By 2035, REI says it is possible to increase renewables capacity to 3.3 times the current level, while
keeping electricity generation cost to about ¥11.2/ kWh. That would be slight below the ¥11.9

level before 2022.

ANRE proposal for split-supply scheme to replace partial supply system
(Government statement, June 17)
•  ANRE unveiled a proposal for a new system to replace the partial supply system that requires retail
electric utilities (the retail arm of the former major electric utilities) to compensate for supply

shortfalls caused by new power market players known as shin denryoku.
•  The govt plans to introduce bunkatsu-kyokyu, which roughly translates as "split supply" system,
where a single point of demand can be supplied by two parties, which are not limited to the
designated retailer.
•  With the start of the split supply scheme, the existing contracts for partial supply will be given a
certain amount of leeway.
•  CONTEXT: The partial supply guidelines were revised on March 15.




ANRE wraps up preliminary talks for revamping power balancing market
(Government statement, June 19)
•  ANRE completed preliminary discussions for revamping the power balancing market, aiming to

create a so-called simultaneous market mechanism to allow all electricity in the wholesale and
balancing markets to be traded at the same time, regardless of supply capacity and regulating
capacity.
•  The direction that the govt is considering include:
o  Introduction of a three-part auction system on a weekly basis.
o  Holding day-ahead auctions where kWh and ΔkW are bid simultaneously.
o  Using the Three-Part Offer method so that power generators register power supply

parameters: (1) start-up cost; (2) minimum output cost; (3) incremental cost curve in the
market (Three-Part Offer method), and retail electricity suppliers bid based on the
purchase price and quantity (kWh).
o  In this simultaneous market, power supply would start up and deliver without excess or
shortage, according to the next-day demand forecast.
•  The plan also envisions scenarios where:
o  Power supplies secured by the general transmission and distribution firms in the previous

day's market are put into a pre-time market;
o  Retail electricity suppliers will buy and sell in the intraday market based on demand
forecasts that are refined as actual supply / demand approaches.
•  CONTEXT: The reform is an attempt to combine the functions of various electricity trading
platforms so that, for example, spot and balancing trades are in sync. The study group intends to
prepare a final report later this year.

Large discovery of critical metals made off remote Japan island
(Asia Nikkei, June 22)
•  Large volumes of cobalt and nickel deposits were discovered near an isolated island in Japan's

exclusive economic zone. The find includes around 230 million tons of manganese nodules on the
seabed around Minami-Torishima, located roughly 1,900 km southeast of Tokyo.
•  The Nippon Foundation and the University of Tokyo conducted a survey earlier this year that
identified the deposit. The highly concentrated nodules are the size of a fist and are said to contain
about 20% manganese and up to 1% cobalt and nickel. That’s enough to cover Japan’s demand
for years.
•  CONTEXT: These metals are used in batteries and other key clean energy technologies.

•  The researchers said they plan to begin extraction on a trial basis in 2025, before forming a
private-sector consortium that would go on to commercialize the project as soon as 2026.
• TAKEAWAY: This does seem to be a sizable find, but the researchers’ timeline for extraction seems overly
optimistic. It’s unclear if the technology to perform the task of extraction from the seabed is readily available,
while completing the environmental and other assessments required to begin mining takes many years. It will
be interesting to see how Japanese businesses will react to this project.

CO2 Exports in APAC: Japan’s Approval of a Key Amendment to
the London Protocol

Last month the Diet approved the 2009 Amendment to the London Protocol that is
relevant to the international shipment of CO2. This move is a critical step to facilitate
Japan exporting captured CO2 for overseas storage.

Through this amendment, Japan is betting on carbon capture, utilization, and storage
(CCUS) to become a vital part of plans for its energy transition. This specifically
concerns decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries such as cement production, chemical
manufacturing, fertilizers, and steel production. It would also strongly influence the
power sector.

Japan’s geography, however, doesn’t allow for the easy and plentiful storage of CO2.
While the country has identified several domestic storage projects, it is looking
overseas to the Southeast Asian region, Australia, and elsewhere as locations that are
better suited for carbon sequestration due to a plethora of depleted oil and natural
gas reservoirs, untapped geologic structures, and saline aquifers.

Hence, the need to build out a CCS supply chain overseas and the importance of
shipping CO2 abroad. This article looks at how Japan has approached the issue from
a technical perspective and within the framework of international law.

The London Protocol and amendments
In October 2020, Japan announced plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 46%
by 2030 over 2013 levels, eventually aiming to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In
March 2023, METI issued Japan’s Long-Term Roadmap for CCS to “promote the
sound development of CCS business in Japan with minimal social costs”.


The roadmap contemplates domestic and international CO2 storage solutions,
beginning with seven projects identified in JOGMEC’s June 2023 Advanced CCS
Projects for support. While most storage sites in the Advanced CCS Projects are
located in Japan, the program includes two major export projects to countries with
sub-seabed geologic structures capable of permanently storing CO2. These are
Malaysia and somewhere in “Oceania”, presumably Australia.

The 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 1972 (“London Protocol”) prohibits its
signatories (contracting parties), such as Japan, from the international offshore storage
of CO2. It prohibits “dumping or incineration at sea of waste or other matter” (Article
2) as well as exports of CO2 for sequestration in sub-seabed geological formations
across international borders (Article 6).

In 2009, however, signatories to the London Protocol adopted an amendment to
Article 6 that allows exports of CO2, as long as there is an agreement or arrangement
17



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

by the exporting and receiving countries to ensure that the London Protocol’s
environmental goals are observed.

To take effect, however, the 2009 amendment must be ratified by two-thirds of the 53
signatories. This has not yet happened. So, in 2019 the contracting parties adopted a
resolution allowing each country to file a “declaration of provisional application” of
the amendment with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) that allows the
export of CO2 pending full ratification of the amendment.

London Protocol’s impact on Japan
As a result of the original London Protocol’s ban on CO2 exports Japan has had to:
1. Approve the 2009 amendment;
2. File a declaration on provisional application of the amendment with the IMO;
and
3. Ink bilateral agreements with the countries to which CO2 is proposed to be
exported for sequestration.

With that in mind, on May 24, the Diet adopted a motion for approval of the 2009
amendment, and the government is expected to:

1. File the “instrument of acceptance” to the 2009 amendment with the IMO
once the Cabinet amends the Trade Control Ordinance to accommodate
CO2 export; and
2. File the declaration of provisional application with the IMO.

Requirements for bilateral agreements
To conclude the process regarding the 2009 amendment, Japan will have to enter
into bilateral “agreements” or “arrangements” with each country receiving CO2. The
contents are broadly described in Article 6.2 of the 2009 amendment and
supplemented by the 2013 Guidance on Implementation of Article 6.2 on the Export
of CO2 Streams for Disposal in Sub-seabed Geological Formations for the Purpose of
Sequestration.

As the title implies, the guidance includes recommendations on how the 2009
amendment may be implemented, including suggested provisions for inclusion in the
agreement or arrangement.

What is the difference between an “agreement” and “arrangement”? According to
Article 3.2, an “agreement” refers to a “legally binding agreement” that could take
the form of a “memorandum of agreement or a treaty,” while an "arrangement" refers
to “something non-binding, such as a memorandum of understanding.”

Neither the protocol nor guidance mandates a particular template or format, but they
impose minimum requirements, depending on the receiving country’s activities.

Minimum requirements
Regardless of whether CO2 exports from Japan are to a contracting party or a non-
contracting party, Article 6.2.1 of the 2009 amendment requires that the agreement or
arrangement allocate “permitting responsibilities between the exporting and
receiving countries, consistent with the provisions of the London Protocol and other


18



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

applicable international law.” (See 2009 amendment, Article 6.2.1; and guidance,
Article 3.5.)

The guidance also recommends several additional provisions for inclusion in an
agreement or arrangement regardless of the role of the contracting party.

Where the receiving country is not a contracting party (such as Malaysia or Indonesia),
Article 6.2.2 of the 2009 amendment requires that the agreement or arrangement
include, “at a minimum”, provisions that are “equivalent to those contained in [the]
protocol, including those relating to the issuance of permits and permit conditions for
complying with the provisions of annex 2, to ensure that the agreement or
arrangement does not derogate from the obligations of contracting parties under [the]
protocol to protect and preserve the marine environment.” (See 2019 amendment,
Article 6.2.2)

The guidance adds several clarifications and recommendations regarding
conformance of the agreement or arrangement with Article 6.2.2. (See Guidance,
Article 3.6)

Expected outcomes
The processes to reach agreements or arrangements between Japan and countries in
the region will differ depending on the status of each potential destination country as
a contracting party (or not).


In addition, the domestic regulatory schemes for sequestration in these countries are
in different stages of development and may need to be aligned with the London
Protocol.

Japanese companies considering CO2 export will most likely be monitoring the
progress of the agreements or arrangements once negotiations begin in order to
ensure that they comply with Article 6.2 and the guidance. And then to provide clear
standards for CO2 export approval by the government and storage approval in
receiving countries.

Japan's approval of the 2009 amendment, along with the domestic CCUS Business Bill
that recently passed, are major steps to adding CCS to the suite of options available
to help industry achieve its decarbonization goals. Concluding bilateral agreements or
arrangements with countries to which Japanese companies plan to export and store
CO2 will be the final legal hurdle to facilitate such exports. Getting to the regulatory
finish line, however, will require the collective effort of all stakeholders in the cross-
border CCS value chain.

How EVs Can Help Build Reliability Into the Grid

Japan increasingly seeks ways to use electric vehicles for purposes other than driving.
The pace of EV adoption has been slow so far, but government task forces are
exploring how to optimize the potential of the batteries in the EV to help balance the
nation’s power grid.

There are more than 400,000 EVs in Japan - both battery electric vehicles (BEV) and
plug-in hybrids (PHEV). In FY2022, BEV and PHEV accounted for less than 3% of all
new car sales in the country. With 410,000 units sold as of 2022, Japan is a far smaller
market than countries such as China (14 million), or the U.S. (nearly 3 million).

By 2030, Japan is targeting to increase the share of new BEV/ PHEV sales to between
20% and 30%, or 800,000 to 1.2 million cars. All new sales are slated to be electric by
2035. To achieve these targets, the government plans to increase the number of
charging spots (including fast chargers) to 300,000 by 2030, according to a guideline
published in October 2023. That compares with about 40,000 units including more
than 10,000 fast chargers currently in Japan.

As more intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar power are added to the
grid, there is an increasing need to balance electricity supply and demand. Energy
storage is one solution to shift the time of electricity use, and batteries in electric cars
are emerging as a promising storage device along with storage batteries and pumped
hydro.


What EVs offer to the grid
One of the advantages of EV batteries is their larger capacity – from 16 to 60 kWh –
compared to 5 to 10 kWh for residential storage systems.

“EV is called a mobile storage battery and it’s a key piece of infrastructure for
transportation and a distributed energy source that has the potential to contribute to
the grid,” stated a METI document presented at the initial meeting of the EV-Grid
Working Group in 2023.

Still, the ministry acknowledged the limits of EV batteries. Since their primary purpose
is transportation, the capacity available for balancing may be limited, and their
availability is uncertain when needed for charging and discharging. Even so, EVs can
contribute by charging and discharging when and where their services are most
needed.

EVs can help stabilize the grid by charging batteries when there is excess electricity
generated by solar and wind farms, and also by shifting the time of charging to avoid
peak time. Using EV batteries could help reduce capital investment in transmission
lines.

The chart below shows how EV batteries can address different needs for different
players.

Balancing market in the mix
Furthermore, a planned change in the balancing market rules will give EV owners a
chance to be compensated in the balancing market. METI plans to allow the
participation of low-voltage resources (homes and stores) in the balancing market
starting 2026.


This will allow an aggregator to bundle multiple electricity sources such as storage
batteries and fuel cell batteries at home, as well as EV charging/ discharging devices.

More work has to be done for EVs to be fully integrated in the grid. In February, the
EV Grid Working Group set milestones for 2030 and 2040 regarding what needs to be
done for EVs.

The group categorized the values that EVs can offer into three groups:
(1) The same level of convenience as ICE cars;
(2) Values unique to EVs;
(3) Additional economic value in the form of contribution to the grid.

According to a February report by the group, to achieve the same level of
convenience, by 2030 Japan needs to install enough charging devices. By 2040, long-
distance driving should become reality with improvements in charging infrastructure
and services.

To unlock the values unique to EVs, all stand-alone houses of EV owners, and more
than a half of apartment buildings, will need to install charging devices by 2030.

By 2040, the WG suggests all houses and apartment buildings should be equipped
with charging devices. Also, by 2030, some EV owners at stand-alone houses should
be able to use EV batteries as a backup power source. More houses and apartment
buildings should be able to do the same in the following decade as the cost of V2X
(vehicle-to-everything) equipment drops.

The chart on page 23 includes some of (3) Additional economic values.


Bottlenecks to realization
The WG also identified key issues to achieve the three types of values.
For (1), bottlenecks are mainly economic challenges such as the higher cost of
installing a charger for older houses than new ones. Other issues include a longer time
to charge an EV than filling an ICE vehicle and higher running costs for charging
businesses.

For (2), there are institutional and technological challenges. For example, V2X devices
are expensive. Many EVs use electricity derived from fossil fuels. The WG said a
mechanism is needed to remotely control the timing of charging when the share of
non-fossil power is bigger.

For (3), challenges encompass many aspects:
For “the optimization of electricity cost,” the mechanism to incentivize EV owners is
not sufficiently developed. More clarity is needed regarding the level of
compensation. The group also pointed out that remote controlling functions for DER
are underdeveloped.

For “the income,” the report pointed out that EVs cannot take part in the balancing
market until 2026. A cost-benefit analysis is needed due to few incentives available for
EVs.

Other challenges include high cost of remote controlling devices, and battery
degradation through charging and discharging upon orders, a lack of visual
information about grid congestion, and a mismatch between grid congestion and EV
availability.

The venture will lease EVs while retaining ownership of the batteries to monitor their
use and increase their reliability. Older batteries will be repurposed for ALTNA’s
storage battery business. The new company will also offer automatic charging plans to
charge EVs when it is cheaper to do so.

Conclusion
EV deployment in Japan is still in the early stage and it is uncertain whether the
number of EVs will meet the targets set by the government. EVs need to be cheaper
and more charging spots should be set up.

Although it is hard to see such projects working at scale for now, as the number of
electric vehicles increases it could turn into a viable business model. Improving the
technologies that manage batteries, as well as the decline in the cost of the batteries
themselves, should help make them a regular part of local and regional energy grid
operation.

As automakers are starting to realize, EVs, in particular, because of the longer lifespan
of their battery units, have as much to offer at rest as in motion.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

BESS
Battery energy storage systems (BESS) capacity is estimated to expand globally at an
annual rate of 24% until 2030, and reach a cumulative capacity of 1,848 GWh, said
consulting company EY.

China / Energy consumption
In 2023, China’s per capita energy surpassed Europe’s for the first time, on the back
of rising demand from technology and manufacturing industries, especially the
expansion of data centers, 5G infrastructure and car charging.

Hong Kong / Hydrogen power
The city launched its Hydrogen Strategy to help reach carbon neutrality. There are
four major vectors: improve legislation, establish standards, align with the market, and
create an environment conducive to hydrogen energy development.

India / Coal power
Demand for coal-based power rose 7.3% in FY2023 to an all-time high, the govt said.
More than 75% of India's power generation was from coal, while gas-fired plants
accounted for only 2%; this is largely due to the high cost of gas relative to coal.

Indonesia / Energy transition
Over the next five years, state oil and gas giant Pertamina will invest $6.2 billion in
clean energy and technology ranging from hydrogen to EV batteries. The company is
pursuing a “double growth strategy” to strengthen its existing oil and gas business,
and to develop low-carbon energy businesses.”

Malaysia / Hydrogen power
SEDC Energy and Gentari will form a JV to set up the Sarawak H2 Hub, supporting
the country’s goal to be a commercial hydrogen producer by 2027. The hub will utilize
a “plug and play” concept, using a modular approach to integrate hydrogen
production units.

Singapore / Floating solar power
Construction on the city-state’s largest planned floating solar farm (in the Kranji
Reservoir) is set to begin in 2025; operation will start in 2027. Projected capacity is
141 MW.

Singapore / Low-carbon power
