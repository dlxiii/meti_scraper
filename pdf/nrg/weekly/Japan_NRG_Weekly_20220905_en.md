Rules on reuse of scrap from old reactors key to building decommissioning industry
(Japan NRG, Aug. 31)
•  Fukui Prefecture urged METI to relax rules on the reuse of materials from decommissioned nuclear
power plants with radiation levels below 0.01 microsieverts and cleared safety standards.

•  The reuse of scrap metal from decommissioned plants is currently limited to power operators, to
identify its further destination. Fukui said the wider reuse of materials with negligible levels of
radioactivity is indispensable in developing the decommissioning business as an industry.
•  CONTEXT: Relaxing rules for decommissioned plant waste destinations will require strategies in
conjunction with the steel sector, the main users of scrap. Any easing will have an impact overseas
since Japan is Asia’s leading exporter of scrap steel, and scrap is increasing in demand for low-

emission steel. Even before the Fukushima disaster, Japanese scrap yards strictly monitored
radioactive levels, which is why no country banned imports of Japanese steel raw materials after
the quake.
•  Power plants could jointly study with steelmakers the wider reuse of decommissioned materials for
decarbonization. For example, molybdenum-nickel-chrome alloy is used for reactor pressure
vessels and more recently, hydrogen absorption and storage systems.



METI mulls support for hydrogen hub at Himeji
(Government Statement, Aug. 26)
•  Two METI working groups – Hydrogen Policy and Decarbonizing Fuel Policy – both under the
Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy, unveiled plans to support companies
developing hydrogen and ammonia supply chains.
•  It’s understood that all steps of the supply chain need support, from manufacturing and

transportation to storage. METI wants to subsidize the gap between the cost of hydrogen/
ammonia and fossil fuels.
•  Kansai Electric showed its plan to develop a major ammonia hub at Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture.
KEPCO wants to mix hydrogen with LNG at its Himeji No. 1 and Himeji No. 2 Thermal Power
Plants, starting around 2030.

Toyota Industries to double output of bipolar nickel hydride batteries
(Company statement, Aug. 30)
•  Starting October, Toyota will double production at the Ishihama plant of bipolar nickel hydride
batteries for hybrid vehicles to 40,000 units/ month.

•  The Kyowa plant with 20,000 units/ month capacity has been operational since May 2021
•  Bipolar nickel hydride batteries consist of metal components that act as cathode on one side and
anode on the other; thus saving space. The simple module reduces electrical resistance, yielding
higher output
•  CONTEXT: Nickel hydride batteries typically use nickel hydroxide as cathode, hydrogen absorbing
alloy as anode, and alkaline solution as electrolyte. Rare earth yttrium may be used for treating

hydrogen.

Sumitomo and Lotte to produce hydrogen using clean electric reactor
(Company Statement, Aug. 24)
•  Sumitomo Corp, Syzygy Plasmonics, Lotte Chemical and Lotte Fine Chemical will test a fully
electric chemical reactor for clean hydrogen production. It will go online in the second half of 2023

at Lotte Chemical HQ in Ulsan, South Korea.
•  CONTEXT: The traditional thermal cracking of ammonia uses high heat and pressure to convert it
to hydrogen gas. The heat is generated by burning fossil fuels; this makes ammonia cracking
carbon intensive. Using fully electric reactors gives hydrogen producers a way to reduce or
eliminate reliance on combustion as the energy source.
•  Syzygy developed reactor technology that uses light from ultra-high-efficiency LEDs to power
chemical reactions. Sumitomo is an investor in Syzygy.



Japan to establish test production of methanol from recycling of plastic waste
(Kankyo Business, Aug. 26)
•  Kobe Steel, Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co., and others started a demo project aimed at establishing
Japan's first technology to synthesize methanol from gas obtained by gasifying plastic waste. The
project aims to establish a recycling system for plastics.

•  MoE partly funds the project that’s important both for its recycling component and the potential to
create a stable supply of environmentally friendly methanol.
•  CONTEXT: Waste plastics are difficult to recycle due to purity issues and are often disposed of by
incineration or into a landfill.
•  The project will run until March 2024 and is in partnership with Osaka Prefecture and Sakai City.
The assumption is that 45,000 tons of methanol can be produced from 60,000 tons of waste

plastic, cutting CO2 emissions by about 100,000 tons compared to conventional methanol
production.

Air Liquide and Itochu to roll out 24-hour hydrogen stations

(Nikkei, Aug. 29)
•  France’s Air Liquide will partner with trading house Itochu to build a network of 24-hour hydrogen
filling stations across Japan.
•  The first will open in Fukushima in 2024 and then mostly along the Shinkansen route.
•  While the government set a target of opening 1000 hydrogen stations by 2030, the failure of fuel
cell vehicles to grow in popularity, and the high cost of establishing such stations, is why there are
only 160 hydrogen filling stations nationwide.

•  The Itochu/Air Liquide stations will take advantage of state subsidies and reduce costs by sharing
car washes and other facilities with adjacent Itochu NX fuel stations.



ZEB with energy storage system results in 8% GHG cuts at Hazama Ando

Negative net worth of TEPCO’s power retailer could impact trading
(Nikkei, TBS, Aug. 28)
•  TEPCO Energy Partner, the electricity retailer that’s part of the TEPCO group, has found itself in
excess of its liabilities by approximately ¥6.7 billion as of the end of June. With LNG and coal
prices rising, profits have deteriorated.
•  This is the first time since the retailer was founded in 2015 that it has recorded negative net worth.

•  The retailer's procurement of electricity from the wholesale market may be affected, and the
parent company has entered into an arrangement to underwrite a capital increase to resolve the
situation.
•  CONTEXT: JEPX, the operator of the wholesale market, requires trading members to maintain a
minimum net worth of ¥10 million in order to have access to the trading.
• TAKEAWAY: This is a potentially destabilizing situation for the power market unless TEPCO Holding moves

quickly to inject capital and retain its retailer’s trading qualifications. The extreme price spike of January 2021
was largely due to the actions of another TEPCO group electricity retailer.



PPS under pressure to secure electricity for 2023
(Aug. 27, Nikkei)
•  In the first trade of baseload power for 2023 delivery on the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX),
the Kansai region’s contracted electricity was 711.3 MW, which is 76 times more than the traded
electricity for 2022 (9.4 MW).
•  The contract prices of Hokkaido (¥29.9/ kWh) and Tokyo (¥33.06/ kWh) were higher than Kansai

(¥20/ kWh).
•  In case PPS（Power Producer and Suppliers) can’t supply contracted electricity to customers, they
need to pay a high penalty to regional power companies. Due to the tight electricity demand and
supply, the PPSs rushed to buy power on the baseload market.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s baseload market started in 2019, and is held four times a year, to trade
baseload electricity for the following year. While sellers are regional electric power companies who
operate nuclear, coal, hydro and geothermal power stations, the buyers are PPS who mainly

operate natural gas power stations.

ANALYSIS

Toyota Has Not Given Up on Gasoline:
Automaker Plans to Develop “Green Gasoline”

Tesla’s long-fought victory over established auto giants in the proverbial ‘beauty
contest’ held by global equity markets has finally convinced the world that the electric
engine is the future. Now, Japan’s national transportation roadmap also embraces the
notion that gasoline-fueled vehicles will disappear from car showrooms by 2035.

Despite the current EV juggernaut that’s been bolstered by the global energy crisis,
one company hasn't given up on gasoline. Welcome to Toyota Motor’s vision for a
carbon-neutral gasoline automobile.

The bold move by Japan’s largest car company might be seen by many as an industry
dinosaur refusing to accept the glorious EV future. Historically, Toyota has favored
hydrogen-powered fuel cell autos or hybrids over EVs.

Yet, Toyota’s vision points to an uncomfortable truth, at least in the domestic auto
market. Even if EVs and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) do replace internal combustion
engine cars in the showroom this decade, the reduction in transport emissions will be
small. In fact, too small to hit the sector’s national targets.

So, does Toyota’s shift of net-zero focus from engine type to fuel make sense? The
path to “green gasoline” is not as far-fetched as it sounds.

“Green gasoline union”
In 2020, Japan’s transportation emissions were 185 million tons. The 2030 goal is to
cut that to 146 million tons, and to end all sales of new gasoline-fueled cars by 2035.
But the government has been one-sided in its approach to carbon neutral driving. It
has focused on breakthrough vehicle development, while fuel has been neglected.
The general attitude has been to leave that to suppliers overseas.

| cut that to 146 million tons, and to end all sales of new gasoline-fueled cars by 2035. |
| But the government has been one-sided in its approach to carbon neutral driving. It |
| has focused on breakthrough vehicle development, while fuel has been neglected. |
| The general attitude has been to leave that to suppliers overseas. |

Replacing fossil fuel vehicles with EVs and FCVs will contribute only 16% of the
required emission reduction, and more measures are required to meet the 2030 goal,
according to another government study. Well, here comes Toyota hoping to make a
breakthrough carbon neutral gasoline after giving birth to hybrid and hydrogen
vehicles.

On July 1, five Toyota group companies – Toyota Motor, Toyota Tsusho, Daihatsu
Motor, Suzuki Motor, and Subaru, along with oil refiner ENEOS – set up a partnership
called the Next Generation Green CO2-free Fuel Technology Research Union.

Mazda and Hino Motor, also Toyota affiliates but focused on diesel vehicles, won’t
participate. So, the venture earned the nickname “green gasoline union”. Its goals
are:

•  To develop large-scale production systems of secondary bioethanol as a potential
gasoline substitute
•  To reuse carbon generated in bioethanol production and by-product oxygen from
hydrogen production, and set up “carbon/oxygen capture and utilization” systems
•  To identify issues that bioethanol would face on driving mechanism and design
efficient powertrain systems
•  To establish methods of forecasting fuel output from feedstock data
•  To discover efficient crops for bioethanol raw materials, and establish harvest
volume forecast methods using soil analysis


Termite intestines boost biofuel
The green gasoline union’s laboratory will be located in the Okuma township in
Fukushima Prefecture, which has been hosting biomass projects growing napier grass
that absorbs radioactive caesium, as well as dent corn, sorghum, erianthus and rye.

Toyota Motor and ENEOS are cellulose ethanol pioneers. Toyota developed XyloAce,
a yeast that boosts ethanol production efficiency. XyloAce comprises saccharomyces
cerevisiae yeast, commonly used for wine production. Termite intestine genes were
combined with the yeast to turn fermentation-inhibiting substances, such as acetic
acid, into ethanol. This increased production.

Meanwhile, ENEOS has been exploring low-cost feedstock. Together with Toppan
Printing it runs an ethanol pilot plant using scrap paper. Their goal is to establish a
continuous process that recycles the feed and yeast over and over, which improves
costs. (See “Paper Ethanol: A bioethanol game changer?” in the June 20, 2022 issue
of Japan NRG).

Shiomi Masato of Japan’s UCO Business Federation told Japan NRG that the green
gasoline union initiative is positive for the sustainable development of green fuel.
Unlike other fuel producers, the union won’t use recycled oil.

Used cooking oil (UCO) has become the key raw material for biodiesel and recently
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as marine fuel. UCO supply constraints may
dampen bioenergy development, he warned, citing that Japan’s UCO exports are
rising rapidly, although the country has a limited supply of 0.4 million tons/ year.

| of Japan NRG). |

Challenges: costs and regulations
Observers say Toyota and ENEOS have good proprietary cellulose ethanol production
technologies, but they need to develop it further to reach commercialization. Perhaps
the two will combine their systems for further impact. However, one researcher says
this may prove technically difficult because Toyota’s yeast doesn’t react with ENEOS’
scrap paper feed. The latter contains little xylose that activates the Toyota-type yeast.

What’s more, production costs are blocking commercialization of scrap paper ethanol,
which are estimated to be ¥120-200/ liter, excluding capital and paper collection/
sorting costs. Gasoline retail prices are ¥150-160/ liter, at historically high levels.

The country’s restrictions on genetic engineering are also an obstacle. Toyota’s high
performance XyloAce yeast is not cultivated in Japan. Production and use of gene
recombined yeast are not impossible, but they’re tightly regulated. In 2019, Toyota
instead signed a XyloAce production licensing deal with U.S.-based Lallemand.

Sawa Issey of Nippon Environment Energy Development (NEED) told Japan NRG that
he was excited by the bioethanol as well as the "bioenergy carbon capture and
utilization" process to produce synthetic e-fuel. He estimates that it will take over ten
years to reduce the cost of e-fuel production to marketable levels, adding that
bioethanol could be the bridge fuel until that happens.

Despite challenges, expectations on green gasoline are mounting. Japan's bioethanol
consumption is expected to be 0.5 million kiloliters in 2022, which is only 1% of the
total gasoline demand of 45 million kiloliters. According to NEED, Japan could
achieve its 2030 transport emission targets by meeting its EV shift target and
introducing E10, gasoline with 10% ethanol.

Annual E10 carbon reduction estimate by vehicle type
Gasoline vehicles            2.84 million tons
Hybrid vehicles              1.1 million tons
Plug-in-hybrid vehicles      0.08 million tons
Total                        4.02 million tons
Source: NEED

Toyota is not alone in pursuing the decarbonization of fuel for cars. The Nissan Global
Foundation has been funding research on crop-derived fuel for decades. Its past
projects include researching jatropha curcas plants for producing biofuel,
photosynthesis for application in power generation, and the central place of ferns in
Japanese forests.

Overall, such private sector activity in green fuel development is crucial since the
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, which has oversight for car
safety, appears to have little interest. Its skepticism might be understandable given
the fact that the government has seen many biomass projects fail. But if Japan is to
meet its 2050 net-zero emission goals then the ministry will need commercial-ready
evidence that compels it to overcome its doubts.

COLUMN:        ENERGY      JOBS    IN  JAPAN

BY ARTHUR (RIKU) OGAWA

First Hire in Japan? Don’t Panic

It’s hardly a secret that hiring / recruitment in Japan is just as unique as the local
culture, and very much in contrast to how things are done in the rest of the world. This
of course means there’s going to be pitfalls and challenges, but also opportunities
and advantages.

In this column, I’d like to shed some light on how to be most effective when you make
your first hire in Japan or plan to take your team to the next level.

Acknowledge differences
There are many examples of companies rushing into Japan with a recruitment
approach that worked well for years in other countries but not here. Sure, some
companies get lucky from time to time, but, unfortunately, more often than not those
efforts end in failure and disappointment, and lead to frustration.
So, what are those differences?

•  Candidate-centered market (vs. Client-centered). On-spec, quality Japanese
professionals will hardly ever apply to a job posting, even if they are
interested in it. Talent in Japan will start with a list of questions about the
company and the job even before they’re willing to speak with you. There are
generally dozens of similar companies/agencies reaching out to them daily
with the exact same opportunities. Why wouldn’t these candidates be
choosy?
•  Leadership and English abilities. While there’s bilingual, charismatic and
experienced talent in Japan, the fact is that it’s a scarce resource. Unless you
are happy to splash the cash at them and adjust to their wish list, you might
want to lower your expectations.
•  Speed. Unlike the points above, as an employer you can impact the hiring
speed, as well as the time necessary for candidates to decide and join your
team. But this will take some time. My advice has been the same for the last
several years, once you have met a good candidate – don’t wait until you
meet five like him/her. Instead, move forward quickly. Otherwise, someone
else will. Seize the day!
•  Recruitment agencies. Although the general flow will be similar to what you
experience overseas, contract details will be different. For example, fee rates
are significantly higher in Japan (it’s not uncommon to see contracts with 35%
- 40% fees!); and these are often applied to the entire salary package, not just
base salary.

One case from a couple of years ago illustrates the above. A mid-size UK company
that had recently expanded to Asia and some European countries also decided to
enter the Japan market. It followed the same recruitment model as in other countries,
paying a global agency under a fixed fee (25% of base salary) and planned to make its
first two hires in Japan within six months. To their surprise, it received zero response
via job boards and was introduced to just two candidates via the agency, both of
which promptly received offers from competitors already present in Japan.

When after the months the company decided to contact with a few Japan-based
agencies. They found out that no agency was willing to go below 30% of total salary
package as their fee. In the end, the company was able to hire one of the two staff it
targeted, but found itself reworking its entire recruitment strategy for Japan. The time
it lost also, unfortunately, cost the firm both moment and delayed their market
entry/product launch for several months.


Choose a reliable recruiting partner
Usually, global companies entering the Japan market are utilizing both internal (HR
overseas) and external (recruitment agencies) resources. Some hiring managers,
however, prefer directly working with recruitment agencies. There’s not a one-for-all
solution, but I’ll list some basic differences that could, hopefully, help you to navigate
the recruitment minefield and help to choose from the list of hundreds of recruitment
agencies out there.

•  Globally branded recruitment firms with an army of recruiters in all major
countries. I’ll omit their names to avoid free advertisement and only focus on
the pros/cons. One of the obvious pros will be volume. Usually, big firms will
have a high volume of activity/performance, especially for the junior or mid-
level positions. The downside is that you won’t always have a specialist for the
field that you’re hiring for and, if so, you’ll likely end up rummaging through a
pile of CVs trying to find your on-spec candidate.
•  Overseas agencies located overseas that are hiring for the Japan market.
Often such agencies have been working with you in other countries and see
Japan business as an important, but a secondary field. They’d often have a
good understanding of your global culture and requirements set by the HQ.
However, most don’t have a foot on the ground, having a limited presence in
Japan and access to a broader candidate pool.
•  Japan-based, industry specialized agencies. There’s not a big number of
those, but such agencies are able to deliver quality and results. Having said
that, often such agencies are more focused on senior level hiring and a
particular industry or limited niches within one industry.

If you’re in the beginning of your business journey in Japan, then working with two or
three trusted recruitment partners is highly recommended to meet your needs.

Just make sure to choose wisely and set the expectations right!

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ LNG
While domestic coal use reached a record high, China is reselling surplus LNG to the
EU, which led to its LNG imports growing 60%, YoY, in the first half of 2022, said
analytics firm Kpler. The EU’s import of 53 million tons of LNG surpassed imports by
China and Japan.

France/ Energy crisis
On Sept. 1, citing a payment dispute, Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Engie,
France’s biggest gas supplier. The Russian state-owned company said it hadn’t
“received full payment for the gas supplied to Engie in July under existing contracts”.

Germany/ Energy crisis
German industries of all sizes and types are stopping production due to high energy
prices. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said efforts to reduce gas consumption
weren’t enough and that “the industries in question aren’t just being restructured but
are experiencing a rupture.”

Offshore drilling
Global offshore energy investment will rise 27% to $173 billion in 2024, reversing a
decade of decline, said Rystad Energy. Offshore production sites are more expensive
to build than onshore, but once operational they can turn profits at lower prices.

Qatar/ Blue ammonia
QatarEnergy will build the world's largest 'blue' ammonia plant, which is expected to
come online in Q1 2026 and to produce 1.2 million tons/ year. The Ammonia-7
project will cost $1.16 billion to build, and will capture and sequester 1.5 million tons
of CO2 a year.

Russia/ Foreign divestment
ExxonMobil said it will fight the Kremlin’s decree to bar foreign companies from
selling stakes in certain projects until the end of 2022. Exxon said it was
“transitioning” its operations at the Sakhalin-1 oil project to another company.

Russia/ Oil cap and Gas suspension
The G7 agreed to a price cap on Russian oil, to be implemented simultaneously as the
EU’s embargoes on Russian oil – Dec. 5 for crude and Feb. 5 for refined products.
Moscow threatened not to sell to countries supporting the price cap. Also, soon after
the oil cap was announced, Russia indefinitely suspended gas flows through the Nord
Stream 1 pipeline, saying it was due to a technical issue.
Singapore/ Hydrogen
Keppel will build a $540 million, 600-MW “hydrogen-ready” natural gas power plant

that might one day run on 100% hydrogen. The facility is expected to be online by the
end of June 2026 and is located on Jurong Island.

UK/ EV batteries
Soaring energy costs will significantly delay plans by Britishvolt to manufacture
batteries at its future £3.8 billion gigafactory. The company wants to build a domestic
EV industry and avoid relying on Asian companies.

UK/ Energy profits
Britain's gas producers and electricity generators could make excess profits of up to
£170 billion over the next two years, Bloomberg reported. The Finance Ministry,
which is preparing a £37 billion energy support package for households, disputes the
report.

Ukraine/ Nuclear power
An IAEA delegation arrived at the contested Zaparozhye Nuclear Power Plant,
Europe’s largest NPP, which is under Russian military control, facing frequent
Ukrainian shelling. IAEA director Rafael Mariano Grossi said his inspectors will remain
at the NPP.
