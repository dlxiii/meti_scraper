NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Basic Energy Plan – Timing Again Uncertain, Content Under Dispute

•  As covered in last month’s reports, we showed that Japan’s Basic Energy Plan, which defines the
government strategy and vision for the mid-term electricity mix among other things, was due to be
published in late spring, then summer, and then delayed.
•  Reports over the last week first suggested the delays might be removed. Then further reports
reiterated that autumn will be the most likely timing of publication.
•  In short, there is a fight between “pro-renewables / anti-nuclear” officials, such as Minister of the

Environment Koizumi, and Minister for Administrative Reforms Kono, and the “pro-nuclear /
cautious on renewables” group that includes METI’s Kajiyama. The latter are not against
renewables, but wish its ratio in the national energy mix to be restrained, believing that a high
renewables component is not feasible in Japan. The former ideally see renewables at 100% of the
energy mix and view the nuclear sector as their main “enemy”.
•  The winners of the above standoff are fossil fuel power operators, whose slice of the pie is less
discussed. Biomass and hydro are another two sectors that have seen recent gains.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Nuclear plant replacements left out of energy plan
(Nikkei, June 30)
o  METI won’t include a provision for nuclear power plant replacements in its revised basic
energy plan.
o  METI feels public faith in nuclear energy is still low after a series of scandals at TEPCO’s

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant.
o  However, by not explicitly including plant replacements, the achievement of net zero
CO2 emissions by 2050 becomes more difficult.
o  Under existing law, nuclear reactors must be retired after 60 years of service.
o  Many argue that without nuclear power stations, it’ll be difficult to prevent significant
increases in the cost of electricity.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Tug of war due to rising share of renewable energy
(Jiji, July 4)
o  Making adjustments to the Basic Energy Plan is proving difficult. PM Suga set a goal of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050; the latest plan is supposed to
carry important revisions that incorporate concrete measures on how to meet that goal.
o  However, a tug of war has broken out within government over the spread of renewable

energy, and now it seems the Plan’s publication may be delayed.
o  Recently, the government suggested the ratio of thermal power may drop to about 40%
while renewables increase to just under 40% by the end of the decade.
o  Voices in the Ministry of the Environment are calling for more ambitious goals for
renewables. METI is reluctant to agree, arguing that there’s a limit to the land on which
solar panels can be installed, and even close to 40% is a difficult target to achieve.
o  Regarding nuclear, voices in the Liberal Democratic Party and industry want a clear policy

to proceed with new expansion and rebuilding, but the ruling party’s coalition partner,
Komeito, is against.

o  The government is also cautious about the fact that public concern over nuclear still
lingers after the Fukushima accident.
o  The difficulty in adjusting the Basic Energy Plan means it may be postponed to after
autumn’s general election. However, it must be revised before the 26th Conference of
the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) in

November.
o  Procrastination could give the international community the impression that Japan is
reluctant to follow through with environmental measures.



Government begins review of energy saving to encourage use of off-peak generation

(Japan NRG, June 30)
•  A review of energy conservation standards and regulatory framework has started, eyeing new
reporting obligations for electricity consumption. The system will encourage a shift to consumption
during low demand hours and to green electricity from fossil power.
•  Consumption measurement will positively reflect power use during off peak hours. Businesses will
also be required to achieve a 1% reduction in electricity consumption intensity every year.
•  Under the current energy conservation law, businesses only report energy intensity converted in

kiloliters, rather than the total amount of energy consumption, which will be a mandatory reporting
item, according to the METI draft proposal.
•  METI will introduce the new framework in 2023 at the earliest, then run the system for three-years
before formalizing it.



Energy Agency rethinks hydropower strategy

(Denki Shimbun, June 25)
•  The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy began a series of closed-door consultations with
hydropower energy stakeholders to encourage operators to build new dams and optimize the use
of existing ones.
•  The last of Japan’s large-scale hydro dams was built in the 1990s, although limited pumped hydro
development continued as late as 2015.
•  The Energy Agency wants to challenge the assumption that Japan lacks any more sites suitable for

dams, as well as leveraging technologies like artificial intelligence to optimize the performance of
existing dams.
•  Hydro dams currently generate around 9% of Japan’s electricity needs.
• TAKEAWAY: As discussed in detail in the May 31 edition of Japan NRG Weekly, hydropower has been one of
the winners so far from the shift in the national energy policies due to decarbonization. The extent of its
increase is unlikely to be large and won’t be comparable to offshore wind, but this energy source will be talked

about more and more as both a generation source and a resilience strategy to combat heavy rains, landslides,
and other natural disasters.

Government to draft FCV safety standard by year's end
(Japan NRG, June 28)
•  METI and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), which have oversight of
fuel cell vehicles, will draft a vehicle safety standard by year’s end, according to an interim report.

•  The ministries agreed to separate vehicle safety standards from those defined by High Pressure
Gas Safety Act for city gas operators. Fuels for FCV hydrogen will include natural gas and LNG.
•  The ministries will continue reviews with a focus on small and standard passenger vehicles and will
publish their regulatory proposal by year's end.



Methanation Council holds its first meeting

(Japan NRG, June 28)
•  28 representatives from the private sector and government held their first Methanation Private
Sector-Government Council meeting to identify technological, social and regulatory issues related
decarbonization of natural gas.
•  Corporate participants included utilities, manufacturers, shipping and shipbuilding firms. From the
government were officials from METI, Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, Environment

Ministry and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
•  Japan Gas Association proposed deploying hydrogen pipelines in coastal areas, for local
production and consumption of hydrogen. INPEX, now conducting a methanation trial with NEDO,
suggested a regulatory framework that authorizes methanation using renewable energy.



Two-tier power imbalancing rate takes effect July 1

(Japan NRG, July 1)
•  The reformed power imbalancing rate with a two-tier structure took effect on July 1, METI said.
There will be a cap on the imbalancing rates to protect consumers from extreme price volatilities.
•  A ¥200/ kWh cap will be in place when the power reserve ratio plunges below 3%. The cap will be
at ¥80/ kWh at other times.
•  TAKEAWAY: See the story on the power crunch in this week’s Analysis section for more details on
the reserve ratio.




IHI and Idemitsu to establish ammonia supply chain
(Kankyo Business, June 29)
•  IHI and Idemitsu will begin joint trials at Idemitsu’s Tokuyama plant, the first step in a process to
establish an ammonia supply chain.
•  Existing storage and processing facilities at the plant will be converted for use with ammonia, and

existing naphtha cracking furnaces will be converted to run on ammonia blends.
•  The Tokushima plant was built in 1957, although its refinery facilities were shut down in 2014. Since
then, the plant has functioned as a manufacturing hub for petrochemical products.

•  IHI is a leader in technology for blending ammonia with legacy fuels such as coal and natural gas,
and was the world’s first operator to run a 2 MW gas turbine on a 70% blend of liquid ammonia.
IHI wants to use the Tokuyama facility to test ammonia storage and combustion technology.




JAPEX and JFE to collaborate on CO2 isolation, recovery
(Kankyo Business, June 28)
•  JAPEX and JFE Engineering said on June 24 that they would begin joint discussions on solutions
to technical challenges to the establishment of systems for transporting carbon dioxide, hydrogen
and ammonia.
•  By pooling their expertise, the two companies plan to identify challenges and strategies

surrounding carbon dioxide isolation and recovery, as well as discussing carbon dioxide pipelines
and other transport infrastructure.
•  JAPEX and JFE also aim to perfect CO2 storage technologies that involve injecting carbon dioxide
into depleted gas fields in the near future.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JAPEX and JFE plan to launch Indonesian CCUS operation
(New Energy Business News, June 30)

o  JAPEX agreed to collaborate with the Indonesian Pertamina Group and LEMIGAS—the
Indonesian Research and Development Centre for Oil and Gas Technology—on a study
to assess the feasibility of a CCUS project in the Sukowati oil field in East Java.
o  JAPEX has experience with domestic gas fields, high pressure gas pipelines and LNG
bunkering stations. JFE Engineering, for its part, has expertise with plants and pipelines.



Citizens block construction of biomass plant claiming lack of consultation
(Kahoku Shimpo, June 30)
•  The city of Tome in Miyagi prefecture has blocked the plans of Toshikaihatsu Research Institute to
build a biomass power plant in the locality.

•  Residents and local authorities claimed that the Institute failed to provide information about the
project to the city government and to properly inform the locals.
•  The city will create a policy and guidelines for renewable energy projects, including biomass, and
will push developers to hold prior consultations with residents on future projects so that locals are
involved from the very first stage.
• TAKEAWAY: We often discuss how the restart of nuclear reactors in Japan is difficult partly because it involves

consultations and both tacit and explicit approvals from local governments and residents. This process,
however, is not reserved only for nuclear facilities. As detailed in last week’s Japan NRG Weekly, more and
more renewables projects are asked to get local clearance. The local voice is very strong in new developments
and pushing through purely on the basis of a national policy does not work. In turn, this complicates the ability
of the national government to implement major changes in energy policy since it requires approvals from many
disparate local stakeholders. Thus, what the national government often resorts to is “buying” local approval
through sector-specific subsidies, which in turn pushes up the cost of energy. The cheapest way to enact

energy transition in Japan is to convert existing power facilities to another energy source. That’s why it’s highly
likely that coal-fired power stations will survive in Japan, even if they’ll not be burning coal in the future.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Meiken completes second biomass generation plant
(Nikkei, July 1)
o  On July 1, major laminate manufacturer Meiken fired up a second biomass-fired

generation plant on the grounds of its Okayama factory.
o  The new 5 MW plant takes the total output of the factory’s biomass-fired generation
facilities to 7 MW. Of this, up to 3 MW will be used to supply the factory, with the
remainder sold to the grid.
o  The plants are fueled by wood scraps, in addition to locally sourced branches and bark.




Hitachi leads Japan in adopting carbon pricing system
(Nikkei; June 30, 2021)
•  Hitachi adopted an internal carbon price (ICP) in FY2019 at ¥5,000/ton to quantify efforts to reduce
CO2 emissions.
•  The Hitachi ICP program led the company to invest ¥260m in 35 projects, including some that

were considered inefficient investments.
•  Hitachi achieved a CO2 reduction of 1,356 tons in FY2019.



Cosmo aims to establish green supply chain
(Sekiyu Tsushin, July 2)
•  Cosmo Energy signed an agreement with EV developer ASF that’s the first step toward a green
supply chain in which lease and maintenance operations for EVs are powered by electricity
generated by wind farms.
•  The arrangement involves Cosmo acquiring a stake in ASF via a third-party share allotment.

•  EVs manufactured by ASF will be available through Cosmo’s lease and car share services.
•  The vehicles will be recharged using “Cosmo Denki Green” power, which is sourced from wind
turbines and other renewable sources.



Marubeni launches solar panel recycling trial
(New Energy Business News, June 29)
•  Marubeni has launched a three-year trial in which it will build an information platform that aims to
make the recovery, reuse and recycling of post-market solar panels more efficient.
•  The platform will enable users to access information on every stage in a solar panel’s life-cycle,

from the time it was discarded by its initial owner to information on reuse and recycling, as well as
making available information on performance in tests.
•  The system will also use block chain technology to prevent the falsification of tracing records.

Kansai Electric restarts Ooi NPP No. 3, secures more fuel for reactors
(Kyodo News, various, July 3)
•  Kansai Electric restarted reactor unit No. 3 at the Ooi nuclear power plant on July 3. Commercial
operations are due to start at the end of July, providing there are no technical glitches.
•  The unit has completed all checks.

•  The restart brings the utility back to operating five units, the most it has had online since the year
of the Fukushima accident.
•  The company has also taken delivery of new fuel for Takahama NPP units No. 3 and No. 4, which
are already in operation.
• TAKEAWAY: This restart marks a remarkable turnaround in nuclear fortunes in Japan over the last six-seven
months. Please see this week’s Analysis section for a full analysis of what is happening in the nuclear industry in

Japan.



Deteriorating nuclear plants face lack of personnel support from Hitachi and others
(Nikkei; July 1, 2021)
•  Around 80 staff members were appointed to perform nuclear-related work in FY2020 by six major
companies (inc. Hitachi and Toshiba), according to a survey by the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum.
•  That’s an approx. 70% decrease from FY2009 when the number peaked.

•  Lack of such personnel indicates a lack of interest in nuclear energy.
•  This is also noticeable at Japanese universities where the no. of students majoring in nuclear
energy dropped from around 670 in FY1992 to around 260 in FY2018.
•  It seems that METI, MEXT, and other ministries as well as the industry has not taken this personnel
situation seriously, according to the article.

First solar auction of 2021 sees bid prices drop to a record low ¥10/ kWh
(New Energy Business News, July 1)
•  There were 135 winning bids in the latest solar capacity auctions and the first in Japan this year.
Participants included ENEOS, the oil refining major, DMM, the online retailer, and Genex Partners

consultancy, which is part of Cordence Worldwide.
•  There were two winning bids at the price of ¥10 per kWh by Fukuhara Kogyo, a Osaka-based
company engaged in construction projects. That matched the lowest price offered by a developer
in such auctions.
•  A total of 208 MW of capacity was auctioned. The upper limit on the bid price was ¥11. The
highest winning bid was at ¥10.98.
•  There were 185 bids in total for almost 249 MW.

•  The weighted average winning bid was ¥10.82.
• TAKEAWAY: The positive trend from the government point of view is that there are still plenty of bidders in
solar auctions and the price is trending lower. However, there is a concern on both the developer side and the
government side about how to lower prices further. Rising costs of solar panel materials are forcing up input
costs. New synergies, business models, or technologies may be needed to significantly change prices going
forward.




Renewables market prepares for major structural upheaval in 2035
(Smart Japan, June 30)
•  The Fuji Keizai Group released the results of a survey on the Japanese market for renewable
energy generation systems.
•  Based on the results, Fuji Keizai projects the market will shrink slightly between 2020 and 2035.
•  Since peaking in 2014, the rate at which solar systems are installed has continued to decline.

•  Rapidly declining installation costs for solar systems mean that the quantum value of the solar
market is projected to fall by nearly 40% by 2035.
•  Meanwhile, significant growth is projected in the wind sector, with the value of the wind market
projected to more than quadruple by 2035.



Offshore wind: Each GW of capacity will cost ¥550B, MRI says

(Kankyo Business, June, 28)
•  Japan has ability to support over 500 GW of offshore wind capacity.
•  According to the Mitsubishi Research Institute, every additional gigawatt of capacity will require a
direct investment of ¥550 billion. When secondary effects on the greater economy are figured in,
this translates into over ¥1 trillion.
•  To encourage industries to invest in wind technology, the government has increased its target for

wind capacity (including floating wind farms) to 40-45 GW by 2040.

INPEX, Kiryu begin supplying carbon-neutral gas
(Sekiyu Tsushin, July 2)
•  INPEX and Gunma-based Kiryu Gas agrees on the sale of carbon-neutral gas.
•  Kiryu Gas will purchase carbon-neutral gas from INPEX to use in its offices and to supply domestic

subscribers.
•  INPEX is working to boost the percentage of renewables in the energy supply as part of its January
pledge to become carbon neutral by 2050.
• TAKEAWAY: Kiryu Gas is an unlisted, small gas supply based in the Gunma prefecture. While the scale of the
purchases is small, this news shows that the market for carbon-neutral LNG, which only appeared in 2019, is
starting to spread. The INPEX sale extends the number of major supplies in carbon-neutral LNG to at least
four: Tokyo Gas, Mitsubishi Corp.’s Diamond Gas International, Mitsui & Co., and INPEX. The biggest of those

is Tokyo Gas, which announced half a dozen supply deals for domestic players, mostly for small volumes. The
other three players also have small-scale deals with local gas retailers like Kiryu as a way to test the waters and
offer it as a menu item to local industry. For example, Mitsui agreed in February to supply Hokkaido Gas,
aiming to popularize carbon-neutral LNG locally. Apart from the obvious issue of clients being reluctant to pay
more for the same gas, there’s a bottleneck at present in procuring enough high-quality carbon credits to offer
the product in Japan. Still, it’s likely that Japan will emerge as one of the world’s largest markets for carbon-
neutral LNG (if it is not already) in the next few years. Japan may have lost its crown as the world’s biggest

LNG importer to China, but it’ll be a leader in this premium market niche for quite a while.

Japan hosts 11th Critical Materials Conference

(Japan NRG, June 30)
•  The governments of Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.S. took part in the Critical Materials
Conference, hosted by Japan. They discussed the current state of the rare earths industry and
issues of critical raw minerals, which are vital for EVs and other decarbonization technologies.
•  The next meeting will be held this autumn, under the chairmanship of Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: CRMs are a vital part of the energy transition and are often overlooked in the discussions. There

was little communicated from Japan about what was discussed at this latest conference, other than the
mention of EVs. However, there are many vital issues that need addressing in CRMs, not least how “green” is
the state of their production. METI has often discussed Japan being self-sufficient in various CRMs by around
2030, but there are few facts suggesting this will actually be possible. Developments in this area will be key for
many industries, not only for energy.

Détente in Japan’s Nuclear Winter?
Or, Calm Before the Storm?

Japan’s nuclear power industry has faced its most difficult decade since the March
2011 disaster at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP. All the nation’s reactor were entirely shut
down at one point. Now, after years of headwinds, the industry is starting to gather
positive momentum.

Eight reactors (over 7 GW) have restarted in the last six and a half months. One or two
more may come online later this year. If they do, Japan will have the most functioning
nuclear capacity since the accident.

Still, amid the optimism inside the nuclear industry, there are still a number of
challenges, and not only about critical public opinion or the volatility of courts and
local government decisions. “Carbon-neutral” solutions for thermal plants will give
nuclear a tight race as a provider of large-scale CO2-free baseload power.


A Decade in Nuclear: an Overview
•  Before the March 2011 accident, Japan had the world’s third-largest nuclear capacity. When
counting reactors under construction, it had 57 units on the books. For comparison, France, has
58 operational reactors today.
•  After the Fukushima event, Japan introduced much stricter technical and operational rules and set
up a new regulatory body, the NRA, with a mandate to be tougher and a lot more independent
than its predecessor, which enjoyed close relations with industry players.
•  As a result of the shakeup, 27 reactors were slated for decommissioning. All new construction (3
units) was halted. The NRA began re-examining all the facilities to check whether they passed the
new standards. Today, the number of reactors that could be operated in Japan is down to 33.
•  Nuclear’s contribution to the total electricity mix was a mere 6% in 2019.

Strategically extending the age of reactors
The most recent Basic Energy Plan, formed three years ago, envisioned nuclear power
providing 20-22% of total electricity in 2030. Given the slow pace of the industry’s
recovery in the public’s eyes, that looked extremely unlikely until recently.

What’s more, reactors are originally licensed to operate for only 40 years. The average
age of the reactor fleet in Japan has not reached over 29 years old. (It was about 24
years in 2011.) So, if no new reactors were built and there were no extensions, the
average age would almost be at the limit by 2030. The current 20-22% target would
be impossible to reach, as would the task of retaining specialist staff and industry
know-how.

As in other countries, Japan decided to allow a 20-year license extension, provided
the facilities pass the regulator’s approval. So far, only four units have done so: three
owned by Kansai Electric and one by Japan Atomic Power Co. However, it has taken
almost five years for the first of the older facilities to actually restart due to the extra
upgrades mandated by the NRA and difficulty in winning over a skeptical local public.

On June 23, Kansai Electric (KEPCO) restarted its 44-year-old Mihama NPP Unit 3, the
first time a 40+ unit operated in Japan. On July 3, Unit 3 of Ooi NPP was switched on.
Next, KEPCO plans to bring back online Takahama NPP Units 1 and 2. The former
may be online this year but still needs to complete updates to its anti-terrorism
standards. The second unit’s timeline is less certain.

A big plus for KEPCO is that local governments have given the green light to the
older reactor units. Now the challenge lies mostly on the operational side. That’s a
major plus for a company whose total capacity and financials are more sensitive to
nuclear than any of its regional peers.

At a later date, industry experts expect Japanese nuclear operators to lobby for a
second 20-year operating life extension, something that has already taken place in the
U.S. In addition, utilities will ask the regulators to discount the years spent in NRA
review as part of a reactor’s lifespan. That could make a massive difference for utilities
such as Hokkaido Electric, whose Tomari NPP has been under the regulator’s
microscope since 2013.

License extensions is a strategy forced on operators because building an entirely new
nuclear power plant in Japan is a huge challenge, says an industry insider. Apart from
Kansai Electric, few regional utilities are likely to take that on. Even Kyushu Electric,
which has operated its reactors the most of any utility post 2011 is unlikely to pursue
new projects unless it has a co-investor, the person said. Kyushu’s large and growing
solar sector makes new nuclear projects risky.


Political sentiment improving
The government’s pro-active stance seems to have made the difference for nuclear in
the last year. METI minister Kajiyama personally held talks with local governors to
progress restarts.

Former prime minister Abe rarely spoke up for nuclear energy during his 2012 to 2020
term in office, but in April this year he formed a new parliamentary group calling for

17

new nuclear power construction and technological advances to replace the aging
fleet.

Current PM Suga’s decarbonization agenda has also bolstered the arguments of the
nuclear lobby.

Even opposition leader Edano Yukio, who served as Chief Cabinet Secretary at the
time of the Fukushima accident, and who is generally against nuclear power, said in an
April interview with the nation’s biggest newspaper, the Yomiuri, that he considers the
task of phasing out nuclear power to be a “100-year job.” With this, Edano suggested
to the pro-nuclear Yomiuri that he would not take any immediate measures to
dismantle the industry.

Meanwhile, as METI prepares the latest edition of the Basic Energy Plan, early
indications are that it will retain nuclear energy’s 20% ratio for 2030. Should the
current pace of restarts continue over the next few years, this target no longer seems
outlandish.

The big concern within the nuclear industry, however, is the subtle shift that METI has
introduced in the categorization of nuclear power. In recent documentation, such as
the Green Growth Strategy published in December 2020, nuclear is lumped with
thermal power as one category, which is expected to account for 30% to 40% of
Japan’s electricity by 2050.

One member of an expert committee at METI sees this as an abandonment of nuclear
power. The 30%-40% number implies that nuclear’s share could drop to 10% by 2050
– an idea that would cause a political uproar in regions that currently host nuclear
facilities, the person said.

With so much effort to decarbonize thermal power plants by co-firing them with
biomass, ammonia and hydrogen, as well as adding on carbon capture, the nuclear
industry’s selling point of being the sole generator of mass CO2-free baseload is also
being eroded, the committee member said.


Utility by Utility Breakdown
For the time being, most nuclear utilities in Japan are more concerned with the near-
term issues. After spending billions of dollars on upgrading their nuclear facilities, as
mandated by the NRA, several of the smaller EPCos could collapse if these reactors
are never restarted. Tohoku Electric, Hokkaido Electric, and Chugoku Electric are
three such firms.

The key litmus test will be the fate of Tohoku’s Onagawa NPP, Unit 2. In November
2020, the Miyagi prefecture governor and other local authorities agreed to the restart
of Onagawa-2. Tohoku still has to complete more upgrades, but with local approval a
restart during FY2022 looks much more certain. If it does happen, it will be the first
nuclear plant to operate in northeastern Japan, the region at the epicenter of the
earthquake and tsunami that caused the Fukushima accident.

Onagawa would also be the first BWR technology to restart in Japan since 2011. The
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant used BWRs, while the reactors that have restarted to date
have all been PWR.

Risks remain. This fall, the Miyagi governor faces re-election and his nuclear decision
will be in the spotlight. Then, there’s the ongoing courts risk. Local residents are
preparing lawsuits to scupper Tohoku’s plans based on claims that the utility’s
evacuation plans are inadequate. Finally, there is a chance of another strong
earthquake or aftershock in the area.

At least the Onagawa NPP restart is proceeding. Tohoku’s Higashidori NPP Unit 1 has
been stuck in limbo over geological concerns and any restart is not seen until at least
FY2024.

Hokkaido Electric has inched forward with a restart of its Tomari NPP and its three
reactors. Earlier this year, the NRA acknowledged the operator’s claim that there are
no active faults under the site. Still, the inspection is only halfway through, according
to the NRA, and still needs to identify the scale of the maximum expected earthquake
and tsunami. Once that’s done, the utility will need to install upgrades to meet any
potential threats. Two of Tomari’s units are over 30 years old.

Chugoku Electric last month won NRA approval for the restart of its BWR model
Shimane NPP Unit 2. It’s the only reactor on the utility’s books. But, local leaders,
especially the new mayor of Izumo City, are uncertain whether to back the plant,
which would require the evacuation of 400,000 residents in case of an emergency. As
such, the earliest restart is currently seen around FY2025.

Evacuation planning is equally a concern for Japan Atomic and its Tokai Daini NPP,
which is the only reactor inside the Tokyo metropolitan region. In March 2021, a court
ordered the utility to suspend operations of the NPP, even though it was not close to
a restart.


TEPCO’s Uncertain Future
These risks, however, can’t compare with the uphill task facing TEPCO, the Fukushima
station operator. The utility has lurched from one scandal and problem to the next,
and earlier this year received a “red card” from the regulator for a security incident.
This will prevent TEPCO from operating its remaining active NPP, the Kashiwazaki
Kariwa until 2H2022 at the earliest.

A likely scenario, however, is that TEPCO will need to transfer its operational nuclear
assets to another company. Tohoku and Japan Atomic are sometimes named in the
local media as candidates. Another would be Kansai Electric. Should it take over
TEPCO’s plants, it would also win access to a nuclear waste storage facility in northern
Japan – something that Kansai Electric badly needs to make go

Japan Is Not Powerless – at Least During the Summer

Why did METI Dial Down Earlier Warnings of a Power Crunch?

First, the ministry responsible for Japan’s energy systems, METI, warned of critical
power shortages and blackout risk during this summer and winter. Then, it dialed
down the alarm and proclaimed the system was fine – at least for this summer.
The conflicting messaging that started in May has since continued with METI’s
reassurances, soon followed by mandates for electricity retailers to be on guard and
for power generators to make sure their fuel stocks are ample.

As Tokyo prepares to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games starting later this
month – an event advertised as 100% powered by renewable energy – the country
cannot afford to lose face and let the capital’s power shortage spill into the open.

However, the short-term measures that Japan is taking to ensure stability in July and
August could come back to bite. The initial panic over summer demand peaks may
have been premature, but the reality will be only too visible come the winter months.


Good cop, bad cop
In mid-May, METI minister Kajiyama said the power supply-demand balance was “at
its worst for several years.” He claimed METI would strongly push consumers to
conserve electricity and announce power saving targets. If demand rose to critical
levels, the government would sound the alarm.

About 10 days later, and Kajiyama’s words were washed over with a much rosier
report from the ministry. It turns out the power balance would be fine this summer,
even with the expected seasonal air-conditioning demand. While power conservation
efforts are appreciated, the report claimed that METI would be making no additional
regulatory push to save energy.

How a ministry’s view could switch in a matter of less
than two weeks is a puzzle.

The most probable rationale, said a utility official, is to
maintain a positive façade during the Olympics.

The ministry projected a misleading image of "power reserve ratio", that if an area
cleared a reserve power ratio of 3% there was no power supply concern.

The forecast, completed by the Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of
Transmissions Operators (OCCTO), put nationwide power supply in July at 173 million
kW and demand at 165.9 million kW, leaving 7.1 million kW or 4.3% of the capacity in
reserve. This nationwide figure is above the 3% reserve that the government requests,
but that’s due to a very large surplus expected in the northernmost Hokkaido region
(16.2%). The forecast reserve ratio in the three main consumption areas of Tokyo,
Chubu and Kansai is at only 3.7%.

If power interconnections between regions are not utilized (or do not function), the
reserve ratio for Tokyo drops to 2.6%; the Toyota Motor heartland of Chubu is at zero;
the Kansai region is in the red with a minus 3.5% ratio. A similar picture is painted by
OCCTO for August. Nationwide, the reserve ratio looks a healthy 4.9%. In Tokyo,
Chubu and Kansai it sits at 3.8%. But, take away the interconnection link capacity and
Kansai is in deficit, and Tokyo and Chubu are below the 3% market.

According to the utilities, even at 3% in reserve it’s hard to guarantee a stable supply.
Energy planners usually aim for double the amount. But, asking the public to save
power during the Olympics is simply not an option. As TV stations cover the well-lit
stadiums, warming up centers and adjacent facilities, local resentment might swell.
News of power shortages during the event would also generate global headlines and
potentially hurt Japan’s attractiveness for investors.

Another risk is a repeat of January, when a shortage in LNG and other available power
capacity quickly spiraled into one of the highest spot electricity prices ever recorded.


Pushing old facilities to the limit
Of course, fudging the numbers is not a realistic strategy to get through the summer
peaks. For that, the government has used all its effort to restart nuclear reactors at a
record pace (See the other article in this week’s Analysis section). Over 7 GW of
nuclear capacity has come online in the last six and a half months.

Over the weekend, Kansai Electic restared its 1.18 GW Ooi NPP Unit 3. Meanwhile,
Kyushu Electric is bringing online a 360 MW coal-fired Karita power plant.

Switching back on older coal stations and nuclear reactors will vastly improve the
August power reserve ratio in Kansai to 10.8%, and in Kyushu to 8.9%. For Tokyo and
Chubu, however, the situation remains tense. Tokyo’s 3.7% reserve is predicated on
getting extra supplies of electricity from neighboring regions. Yet, one of its
neighbors is Chubu, which is in a similar if not worse predicament. In OCCTO’s worst-
case scenario, Japan would be short of 400 MW of capacity in July and 190 MW in
August.

What’s most concerning, according to an official at the Federation of Electric Power
Companies of Japan (FEPC), is that some plants running this month and in August,
technically, should be shut down for maintenance. That raises the possibility of trouble
occurring due to delayed check-ups.

the frequency of patrol of their facilities. Digital and other advanced technologies are
being installed to quickly detect abnormalities in furnace temperatures or turbine
conditions, but once malfunctions are detected, the plants will still need to idle.

Certainly, such prolonged running of stations without maintenance cannot continue
for every peak season, which raises questions about the strategy for the winter.
Should power shortages occur, a further concern is price volatility. After market
liberalization, the number of electricity retailers in Japan has risen to 725. However,
only 54 of those have their own generation facilities. The remainder buy power either
directly from generators or from the open market.

At times of shortage, large generators can prioritize their own delivery over selling
into the spot market. As in January, this could leave several hundred retailers
scrambling to secure volumes in the spot market, sending prices sky high. False
alarms may also trigger price volatilities.

METI held online meeting with retailers in June urging them to increase the ratio of
power supply sourced directly from power generators, and to hedge in the futures
market.


Emergency Options
OCCTO says there’s a system in place that automatically curbs demand from big
power users. In a power crunch, retailers and large consumers have contracts
according to which consumers systematically cut power usage during shortages.
Under this arrangement, up to 430 MW of capacity can be freed up, OCCTO says.
The big users can forego volumes to retailers because many have their own
emergency generators. Last January, for example, Asahi Brewery activated its
emergency power units and supported not only its factories but even local needs.

METI data shows that Japanese businesses have 5,857 power units for internal use
during emergencies, with a combined maximum capacity of 28.8 GW. However, this
capacity is not meant to run for months on end. It’s a short-term solution.

There’s only a 40% change of summer temperatures being above average this year,
according to JMA data. So, most likely, this summer should pass without too much
trouble.

The numbers for the coming winter, however, are another matter. Even on a
nationwide basis, OCCTO sees reserves of only 3.8% in January and just 2.4% in
February. For Tokyo, the reserve ratio goes into the red.

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Batteries:
Nissan and its Chinese partner, Envision AESC, will build the UK’s first gigafactory to
manufacture 9 GWh of batteries for EVs in Sunderland at a cost of $1.4 billion,
creating 6,000 jobs. The UK has banned sales of petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030.

Nuclear Power:
1). In Taiwan, Taipower announced the permanent closure of unit 1 at the Guosheng
nuclear power plant. The 985 MW BWR had been scheduled to be decommissioned
in December but a shortage of used fuel storage capacity has forced the state-owned
company to take the unit offline early.
2). In Egypt, the Nuclear Power Plants Authority (NPPA) applied to the Nuclear
Regulatory Authority for a construction permit for units 1 and 2 of the El Dabaa
nuclear power plant. Russia's Rosatom will start construction once the permit is
granted.
3). The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering granting permits to allow
100-year operating lives for the U.S. reactor fleet.
4). Brazil's National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) hired a
consortium to structure the project for the completion of the Angra 3 nuclear power
plant in Rio de Janeiro. BNDES has been providing technical services to the Angra
plant's owner, Eletronuclear, since 2019.

Coal:
1). The UK is accelerating its target to end coal use in electricity generation by one
year to October 2024 as it prepares to host COP26 in November. Coal accounted for
only two percent of the UK’s electricity mix in 2020, compared with 40 percent 10
years ago.
2). Glencore will buy out minority owners of the Cerrejon thermal coal mine in
Colombia for almost $300 million as coal prices hit highest levels in a decade due to
stronger Asian demand, coal shortages in China, and low levels of investment.
3). Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has abandoned plans to build a $3 billion
coal-fired power plant in Zimbabwe.

Oil & Gas:
1). WTI and Brent both exceeded $75 a barrel for the first time since 2018 as OPEC+
failed to reach an agreement on production increases due to objections from the
UAE.
2). Nymex natural gas prices in the U.S. was the world’s best performing asset class in
Q2, rising by 40% over three months.
3). U.S. oil and gas rig count fell by one to 456, according to Baker Hughes. Total rig
count is up 172 rigs or 61%, YoY. It is also up 87% since falling to a record low of 244
in August 2020.
4). Progressives in the U.S. Democratic Party are now thought to be pressuring the
Biden administration to reduce U.S. reliance on natural gas.

EVs:
1). The Southern Chinese city of Liuzhou has become the effective capital of China’s
growing EV industry, with EV sales penetration of 30%, the second highest in the
world, after Oslo.
2). Tesla has been forced to “recall” 300,000 EVs in China due to a software glitch.
3). Honda will introduce a new electric SUV, the Prologue, and an electric Acura SUV
in the U.S. in 2024.

Aviation:
United Airlines will order 200 Boeing 737 Maxes and 70 Airbus A321neos as demand
for air travel picks up across the U.S., an order worth $30 billion. The investment is
expected to generate 26,000 jobs. However, Rystad Energy expects global jet fuel
consumption to be nearly 3 million bpd lower in 2021 than in 2019. Rystad believes
international travel will revert to 2019 levels only in 2023.

Electric Drones:
1). The UK’s BAE Systems is building the world’s first solar-electric powered
communications drone that can operate in the stratosphere at an altitude of 21km for
as long as one year.
2). Zipline, a drone delivery service based in California, has raised $250 million in new
capital, and increased its valuation to almost $3 billion.

Solar Power:
1). China now accounts for 34% of installed global PC capacity and over 70% of PV
module production, according to a recent report from Japan’s RTS.
2). Elon Musk is seeking to dramatically increase the installations of his Solar Roof
residential home product across the U.S., aiming at 1,000 installations per week, a
five-fold increase on current installations.

CO2:
A billion tons of CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere by 2025 if the terms of
the Paris Agreement are to be met and a billion tons per annum thereafter according
to a report by ‘Coalition for Negative Emissions’ and McKinsey.

Clean Electricity Standard:
President Biden is thought to be preparing legislation and standards that will mandate
all U.S. electric utilities to generate at least 80% of electricity from clean sources by
2030, and 100% by 2035. Currently, the U.S. $1 trillion infrastructure plan only
includes budgets for EV charging infrastructure.

Carbon Taxes:
Kemper Capital Management, the $86 billion asset management company, has
estimated that a $75 per ton carbon tax could knock 20% off the valuation of global
equities markets. A tax of $150 per ton could eliminate 40% of global equities
valuations or over $40 trillion.

Heat Waves:
Temperature records in Oregon, Washington State, and British Columbia were
obliterated last week with records sometimes exceeding 50 Celsius, creating a “heat
dome”. Seventy six people are thought to have died in Oregon and Washington, and
hundreds may have died in Canada. Hydroelectric power plants in Canada were also
impacted by ensuing fires.

China:
China overtook Japan as the world’s largest importer of LNG in the 12 months to June
2021, with 76.3 million tons of imports vs. Japan’s 76.1 million tons.

India:
Reliance Industries has committed to invest $10 billion in clean power over the next
three years. India’s Adani Green Energy is also seeking to be the world’s largest
producer of renewable energy by 2030.

Bangladesh:
Bangladesh has scrapped plans to build 10 new coal-powered plants.

Australia:
J-Power, Iwatani, Marubeni, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Sumitomo Corp. continue
to invest in hydrogen production from brown coal in the State of Victoria and are
seeking to transport hydrogen to a storage facility in Kobe before March 2022, using
New South Wales as a “Hydrogen Valley” hub.

Qatar:
Qatar Petroleum raised $12.5 billion in the largest emerging markets bond offering
this year to finance the expansion of its LNG business. Citi and JP Morgan were global
coordinators, and the issue was four times oversubscribed.

Iraq:
A power outage hit most of Iraq’s 22 GW electricity infrastructure on Friday causing
extensive blackouts and triggering the resignation of the Electricity Minister. Sabotage
has not been ruled out.

Lebanon:
Fuel subsidies may be costing the Lebanese Central Bank $500 million per month as
the country struggles to import fuel to overcome chronic fuel shortages. The EU is
considering sanctions on Lebanese politicians unless a political solution is found.

Africa : Gabon:
Gabon is the first African country to receive results-based payments for curbing
deforestation under the UN-sponsored Central African Forest Initiative (Cafi). Gabon
was awarded $17 million from Norway through Cafi because of lower emissions from
forest loss in 2016 and 2017. The payment is part of a 2019 agreement between
Gabon and Cafi to provide funding worth $150m for reducing emissions from
deforestation. The scheme may eventually enable Gabon to sell its emissions
reductions as credits on the carbon market. Nearly 90% of Gabon is covered by forest,
which captures more carbon than the country emits.

Norway:
Parliament has set a target of a 50% cut in emissions for Norway’s offshore oil and gas
explorers by 2030, forcing them to rely on onshore hydropower to power their
offshore oil and gas facilities. Oil and gas exports account for 40% of Norwegian
exports.

Switzerland:
Gunvor, the international energy trader, is being investigated by Swiss federal
prosecutors for bribery and money laundering in its Ecuadorian oil trading business.

U.K.:
Hurricane Energy, the North Sea oil and gas producer, failed to have its restructuring
plan approved by the High Court in London making it likely the company will default
on $230 million of bond payments in 2022.

U.S.:
1). Hitachi is planning to centralize its semi-conductor research business in Oregon to
take advantage of the $1 trillion+ U.S. infrastructure investment plans and to meet the
global shortage of semi-conductors which is having a major impact on the
transportation sector.
2). 22,000 customers in Michigan suffered power outages last week following flooding
around Detroit and Wayne County.
3). A record $6.2 billion has been invested, YTD, in green-energy ETFs in the U.S.
4). Chevron is expected to sell $1 billion of oil and gas assets in the Permian Basin,
with oil and gas prices at multi-year highs.
5). The Federal Trade Commission ordered Japan’s 7-Eleven to sell over 200 fuel
outlets as part of the FTC approval of the $21 billion acquisition of the Speedway
chain from Marathon Petroleum.

Mexico:
The appointment of an operator for the Zama offshore oil field in the Gulf of Mexico,
which is thought to have reserves of 1.4 to two billion barrels of oil, is regarded as
another major test of Mexico’s energy strategy with state-owned Pemex and Texas’
Talos Energy vying for the operator position.

Panama:
Droughts are impacting the operation of the 50-mile Panama Canal, with four of the
past seven years the driest since 1950, reducing rainwater needed to operate the
canal. Alternative transportation routes for the four percent of global trade that passes
through the canal would create significantly higher emissions.

Brazil:
Brazil’s imports of liquefied natural gas hit a record high of 660,000 tons in June due
to its worst drought in a century. Brazil is the world’s third largest generator of
hydropower with over 100 GW of capacity.
