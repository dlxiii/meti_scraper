CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  High-voltage charges will be discounted by ¥2 in August and Sept, and ¥1.3 in October. City gas
will be reduced by ¥17.5/ m3 in August and Sept, and ¥10 in October.
•  Customers do not need to apply for these discounts, they are automatic, as the govt seeks to offer
immediate support in light of rising prices. The discount amount will be deducted from the
monthly fuel cost adjustment and raw material cost adjustment bill items.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Hokkaido Electric to offer subsidized power, gas this fall
(Company Statement, July 18)
o  The main utility for the north island of Hokkaido said it will cooperate with the govt’s
electricity and gas price support measures, and offer discounts on September to
November electricity and city gas bills.
o  The discount is available to all customers with a low-voltage contract (¥4/ kWh in Sept-

Oct, then ¥2.5 in Nov); high-voltage electricity contract (¥2/ kWh in Sept-Oct, then ¥1.3
in Nov); and buyers of city gas (¥17.5/ m3 in Sept-Oct, then ¥10 in Nov).

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

PART ONE: Building Hydrogen/ Ammonia Supply Chains –
How Far Have They Come?

After Japan’s government published the Basic Hydrogen Strategy in 2017, over 50
supply chain plans sprang up from business consortiums and municipalities. Now, new
feasibility study launches are continuing into this year.

The Hydrogen Society Promotion Act that passed the Diet in May promises subsidies
for 15 years for qualified projects. Many studies and projects in Japan are about
building supply chains, rather than a large production base.

The new sources of clean energy need to satisfy the “S+3E” criteria to get state
funding. It stands for “safety, economic efficiency, energy security and environment-
focused”. This means that supply plans need to address consumer demand, which is
about delivering hydrogen in an economically efficient manner. Hydrogen user hubs
need to identify their sources of stable supplies.


Green hydrogen production sites will go onstream in 2025, and the next wave of
hydrogen market hype will be about 2027, when ammonia-coal co-firing begins. In the
2030’s, hydrogen-fired power generation and other technologies under development
are expected to fully enter the market.

This analysis is Part 1 of two articles, and it looks into the projects in an advanced
phase. Naturally, the smaller ones are commercializing first.

Repurposing oil infrastructure
METI has clearly stated that supply chain building makes the national economy
stronger. Companies with a total supply chain system will be more likely to compete
in international markets compared to those with solutions that address only part of the
supply network.

Japan NRG categorized these supply chain projects into three types:
•  Those that capitalize on legacy fossil fuel infrastructure, driven by facility
owners such as the oil and chemical refineries;
•  Those that address specific requirements of power utilities and other heavy
emitters with deadlines to cut their carbon footprint; and
•  Those that are building new local supply sources, led by municipalities with
renewables resources.

The re-use of legacy infrastructure has both cost and lead time advantages. It’s
cheaper to upgrade naphtha pipelines to accommodate high-pressure gas, rather
than building a whole new transportation network. Commercial hydrogen supply
services are already operational in Kawasaki City using decades-old plastic waste
treatment facilities and pipelines.

Since 2003, chemical manufacturer Resonac has been producing hydrogen from
plastic waste. Its Kawasaki plant produces about 20,000 tons/ year of hydrogen. “In
the early days, plastic recycling was unpopular because people thought the process
was polluting, but after Coca Cola called it a climate solution, the momentum picked
up,” said a Resonac official.

Today, the use of plastic waste-derived hydrogen can boost corporate image. The
Kawasaki King Skyfront Tokyu Rei Hotel, located several kilometers away from the
Resonac plant, switched to hydrogen-fueled heating and power systems two years
ago. After almost a year of trial runs at the hotel, Resonac decided to commercialize
its hydrogen supply service. Since last September, it has been delivering the gas via
underground pipelines built for naphtha. In addition to hydrogen, Resonac produces
ammonia.

ENEOS is another upcycler, developing a value chain centered on the
methylcyclohexane (MCH) chemical compound. After reacting with toluene, hydrogen
converts into MCH, making it possible to store and transport it at normal
temperatures and pressures.

This is unusual for the hydrogen family, which requires temperatures below zero and
high pressure for storage. Thanks to MCH, conventional tankers, trolley trucks,
onshore and offshore oil tanks, and oil refineries can be used. Refineries have
dehydrogenation equipment that converts MCH back to hydrogen.

ENEOS plans to import thousands of tons of MCH through the Kawasaki port,
supplying it to Haneda Airport and others along Tokyo Bay. Last year, it held the first
MCH value chain trial run: Hydrogen produced and converted to MCH in Australia,
using its proprietary technology called DirectMCH, was shipped to Japan, where it
was converted back to hydrogen at a refinery and finally used to fuel a fuel-cell-
vehicle. The ship carried only a few tons, but a second trial run is planned for 2025.
This time, the volume should be larger as ENEOS is scaling up its 150 kW Australian
electrolyzer to a 1-MW size or larger.


The MCH chain will commercialize in about 2030 when there are more hydrogen
supplies overseas. ENEOS also has issues to clear before the service launch. In order
to carry more MCH, it seeks to change a regulation on the tanker cargo volume limit,
which stands at 3,000 cubic meters for Class 2 tankers.

The consumer side of the supply chain also needs to be strengthened. ENEOS wants
to find more users like Haneda Airport that plans to introduce a hydrogen-fueled
system to supply power and heat to the terminal building.

Repurposing could take longer if the old and new functional requirements are too
different. A consortium in west Japan plans to install gas pipelines in the ducts along
the railway tracks and underground telecom cabling systems, to deliver to industrial
users hydrogen imported into the port of Himeji.

Fusion of flammable gas and telecom cable pipelines is unprecedented, and it may
take years to reset safety and other requirements as these are essential infrastructure.
The consortium in charge, which consists of Kansai Electric, the NTT Group, the JR

Group and Panasonic, has a vague target for commercialization. They say the project
will be operational in the 2030’s.

Ammonia supply chains to serve big users
Coal-ammonia co-firing, or mixing ammonia with coal, to generate power is a typical
demand-driven project. It involves a handful of users with a significant demand, and
the supply chains are custom-tailored for them. Co-firing is also a repurposing of
existing infrastructure. The power plants are not overhauled entirely, but burners and
related equipment are replaced.
Therefore, the lead time for building co-firing supply chains is relatively short: from
planning to full-scale operation would take six years. Domestic supply chains are
possibly the shortest in terms of distance: only a few kilometers from certain ammonia
port terminals to the power plants.
The major ammonia supply chain projects are: the Central Japan Hydrogen and
Ammonia project in Aichi, Mie and Gifu prefectures; and the Shunan Industrial
Complex project in Yamaguchi Prefecture. The consortium running these projects
have strong support from the municipal and national governments, which also helped
shorten the lead time.
The government has an ammonia first policy. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism (MLIT) is writing ammonia bunkering guidelines although
there’s no ammonia oceangoing vessel sailing anywhere. Thanks to this push, the
ammonia supply chains are likely to launch in 2027-2028, before ENEOS brings
onstream its MCH chain.

JERA, the key player in the Central Japan consortium, will start running the Hekinan
No. 4 coal power unit with 20% ammonia co-firing in FY2027. It recently completed a
three-month co-firing trial at Hekinan and will start plant reconstruction later this year.

During the trial, co-firing was not conducted continuously at 20%, with time spent on
testing and measuring emissions as well as power generating performance. Preparing
for the FY2027 start of commercial-scale, continuous co-firing will involve not only
building the new infrastructure, such as bigger ammonia storage tanks, but also
thorough equipment checks.

Tokuyama, Tosoh and Zeon Corp, which operate coal power plants in Shunan, plan to
start ammonia co-firing in 2028 and later. But they have not conducted any trials yet.
Meanwhile, JERA has already held international tenders to purchase ammonia, and
selected the initial suppliers, which will deliver the fuel to the Kinuura port, now a coal
offloading terminal. For the Shunan users, Idemitsu Kosan will be the supplier of
imported ammonia.

In terms of volumes, JERA will require at least 0.5 million tons/ year, while the three
Shunan companies will need about 1 million tons/ year combined.

Ammonia is also used to replace methane and other gases used at chemical plants;
the gases fuel naphtha crackers. Idemitsu Kosan has succeeded in running a naphtha
cracker with ammonia replacing 20% of the fuel. Mitsui Chemicals, which is building
an ammonia supply chain based in Osaka Bay, aims for an even higher ammonia ratio.
In fact, it seeks ammonia to take over entirely and expects to implement such
technology in 2030.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
Aomori Proposes New Regional Rules for

‘Cohabitation’ with Renewables Projects
Last year, Aomori Prefecture’s incoming governor announced one of the most
audacious plans for a regional tax on renewable energy projects in Japan, vowing to
bring in a levy that would apply even to existing solar and wind farms. A year on, the
prefecture’s strategy for the renewables sector looks quite different.

This month, a panel of experts employed by the prefecture published a skeleton draft
of an ordinance that would see the local authorities assume greater control over solar
and onshore wind projects. Specifically, the proposal targets operators with solar
projects of over 2 MW in capacity (and 3 ha in size) and wind farms sized 500 kW and
above.

The panel recommended that the prefecture use zoning rules, and placed an
emphasis on installing an official community consultation procedure. The panel
provided no details of a possible future tax.


After the rapid introduction of, in particular, solar power capacity in the last ten years
or so, Japan has seen a slowdown in the rollout of new renewables facilities. Rising
costs and dropping state tariffs for new projects were among the major factors, but a
public backlash against new solar and wind farms in some communities has also been
a serious issue in recent years. That has emboldened some municipalities, and even
regional governments, to introduce new taxes or regulations to more closely control
new developments.

In April, Miyagi became the first prefecture in Japan to introduce an ordinance that
effectively taxes owners of new solar, wind or biomass generation facilities that cut
down a certain level of forest cover to build the project. And so it was feared that
Aomori would follow with an even more expansive tax plan.

New zoning concept
Aomori’s expert panel on renewables development was created earlier this year by
Governor Miyashita Soichiro, who took office in June 2023. Soon after, Miyashita
announced that he aimed at slowing down the proliferation of onshore wind projects,
because, in his words, they were not meeting community interests. Aomori is the
country’s top wind power producer, accounting for 20% of wind generation.

What the experts came back to the governor with is a little different from his 2023
pronouncements. Firstly, the draft of the proposed ordinance excludes offshore wind,
residential rooftop solar, biomass, and hydro power sources.

It also states that the purpose of the new regulation in Aomori is not to discourage the
local development of renewable energy, but to ensure that it expands in a smooth
manner, avoiding environmental damage. The panel noted that most community
conflicts in Aomori were related to solar and onshore wind farms.

Going forward, the panel proposes creating a zoning concept. This will restrict the
areas where new solar and onshore wind projects can be sited. But even in the least
restricted zone (a “cohabitation district”), a community council may need to be set up
before an operator can even hold its first town hall meeting. This is the case if the
community members and the operator seek to become “a renewables promotion
district” as defined in the Act to Prevent Global Warming. The latter is important to
help receive backing from the MoE, which has an important voice in decisions on
large renewables projects.

The panel suggests introducing:
1) Zoning concept native to Aomori to clarify in which areas renewable projects are
banned outright;
2) Closely monitored communication between developers and community
stakeholders.

The prefecture will then make a judgment on whether proper communication took
place or not before giving them a green light.

The proposal sees the need for two major zones: the “protected zones,” where
renewable projects will be banned; and “cohabitation zones,” where projects are
possible should they meet set requirements. There are two sub-categories in the latter
zone: “preserved districts”; and “cohabitation districts”. Projects in the “preserved
districts” will require approval from the municipalities in order to begin the local
communication process.


In theory, renewable project development will be encouraged in the “cohabitation
districts”, provided that there is no strong opposition.

The panel also said it will write guidelines on the factors that project operators need
to take into consideration when choosing sites. Their guidelines will include protection
of livelihood and assets, consideration around disaster prevention and national

defense issues, as well as requirements related to nature, landscape, history and
culture.

The new communication procedure will involve:
1) municipal and prefectural governments sending their views to project
operators in writing; and
2) The prefecture making a final judgment on whether a consensus was
successfully formed with community stakeholders.

The panel argues that under the present Environmental Impact Assessment process,
which requires the operators to disclose scoping documents and survey results, there
is no mechanism to reflect the interest of the municipalities directly affected by
projects. The present system allows only the governor to submit opinions to the
Environment Ministry and METI.

New tax
The panel was inconclusive about the new tax on renewable operators, an idea put
forward by the governor last year. His initial plan was to levy a tax on all solar and
wind operators, new and already operating. The panel did not discuss tax rates, to
whom a potential tax will apply, or when. It said the scope of a renewable project’s tax
will reflect its zoning category, environmental impact and project size.


The panel also clarified that tax rates should not be designed so as to chase away
renewables operators. Further, any proceeds from a tax should be limited to
promoting cohabitation, conservation, renewables development and similar,
according to the panel’s findings.

The governor said last year he intended the revenue from a new renewables tax to be
used freely, which would allow funds to be directed to causes unrelated to the
environment.

Conclusion
The panel will need to work out details of the ordinance, including any new tax
proposal, and these ideas would then need to get approval from the prefectural
assembly.

The success of any new system that Aomori introduces will also depend on the clarity
of its guidelines for defining zones. The MoE has already tried to spur the creation of
various “renewables promotion zones” under the umbrella of the Global Warming
Act, but this program has seen little takeup. Municipalities have been loath to strictly
define such zones, and efforts to do so were complicated by competing stakeholders’
interests.

Still, Aomori may succeed in setting a precedent for introducing zoning-based
ordinances and provide a template for local communication procedures, ideas that
other prefectures could borrow. Introducing a new tax requires national government
approval, but changing administrative rules is within the remit of prefectural
authorities. Other regions may see this as a viable approach to control new
developments.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Nuclear power
The clean energy industry’s opposition to nuclear power is on two fronts:
technological complexity and viability, and high costs. This was one of the main
takeaways from last week’s Australian Clean Energy Summit 2024.

Canada / Oil exports
Asia's crude oil imports from the expanded Trans Mountain pipeline will rise as major
refiners in China, Japan and South Korea seek more supply. The flow of crude from
Alberta to Canada's Pacific coast will triple to 890,000 bpd. The pipeline gives
Canadian producers more access to the U.S. West Coast and Asian markets.

China / Carbon emissions
China plans to cut carbon emissions in its coal power industry by piloting co-firing
using coal mixed with either green ammonia or biomass, as well as with carbon
capture, utilization and storage.

India / Russia
PM Modi and President Putin agreed to cooperate in energy, including nuclear power,
oil refining and petrochemicals. Both are also looking into increasing the supply of
coking coal, and exporting anthracite coal from Russia to India.

South Korea / Nuclear power
The Czech govt picked Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) as preferred bidder to
build two nuclear reactors, marking South Korea's first overseas order for a large-scale
nuclear power project since 2009.

Sri Lanka / Energy transition
The Asian Development Bank granted Sri Lanka a $100 million policy-based loan to
support reforms in the power sector introduced under the Electricity Act; this includes
institutional and regulatory reforms that aim to improve operational sustainability of
the electricity sector.

Thailand / Energy scandal
Share prices of Thai renewable energy company, Energy Absolute, plunged 30% in
trading on July 16 after the lifting of a trade suspension following a leadership shake-
up. Shares had been suspended on July 15 when the company announced changes to
its board and senior management; the previous CEO was accused of fraud.

UAE / Green finance
State-backed green energy group Masdar raised $1 billion with its second green bond
issuance on the London Stock Exchange. It was five times oversubscribed and is part
of a larger effort to raise up to $3 billion to deploy 100 GW of renewable energy
capacity by 2030. Masdar has a portfolio worth more than $30 billion.

U.S. / LNG exports
A U.S. court ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess the
impact of GHGs from Commonwealth LNG's project in Louisiana. By 2027, the
government aims to cut average carbon emissions by 50% from 2023 levels.

Vietnam / Renewable energy
Vietnam’s renewable energy developers are set to benefit from a newly approved
mechanism for direct power purchase agreements, said Saigon Securities, adding that
the DPPA can encourage more investment in domestic renewable energy, thus
improving efficiency of the country’s power market.
