NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Japan mulls higher BESS allotment in next long-term decarbonized capacity auction

(Government statement, May 28)
•  The govt said it’s considering raising the capacity on offer for the second round of the long-term
decarbonized power auction (LTDA) from just under 4 GW to an excess of 4 GW. The capacity
tendered in Round 1 exceeded 7.8 GW.
•  Acknowledging the high ratio of bids to approved projects in the BESS and pumped storage
category, the govt working group reviewing the auction said it will look for ways to accommodate
the strong interest in this section.

•  Also under consideration is raising the minimum bid capacity for storage batteries from 10 MW to
30 MW. The auctioned BESS were required to be operational for at least 3 hours, but the govt
could revise this criteria to 3-6 hours, or more than 6 hours.
•  For pumped storage, the minimum bidding capacity could be set at 30 MW, the same for general
hydropower.
•  CONTEXT: The govt plans to reflect actual BESS demand given that the average capacity bid in
the first round held in January was 35 MW. The changes will also reflect the original purpose of the

auction: to gather large-scale power sources.
•  Separately, the criteria for LNG-fired power plants may also be altered after almost the entire
three-year quota of 6 GW for this generation type was allocated in Round 1. The LNG quota in the
LTDA was separate from the 4 GW on offer to other sources.
•  A new deadline for the start of supply of LNG-fired power is under consideration. The original
deadline was 6 years but many operators face construction delays.
•  For nuclear energy, the govt said it also plans to establish new solicitation frameworks that would

cover “investment in safety measures” for existing stations.
•  Seeing some LTDA categories, such as upgrades of existing thermal plants, receive less interest
than expected, the govt said it will consider improving the remuneration rate, the refund rate for
other market revenues, and the maximum price. However, it warned that improving the incentives
will need to be balanced with not putting much more burden on consumers, or distorting the
fairness of other markets. So, changes will not be forthcoming immediately, but will be part of an

ongoing review process.
• TAKEAWAY: As expected, the govt is now reviewing the LTDA results and proposing ways that the auction will
be amended going forward. The review process will likely take a while and seek to gather opinions from
market participants, before firming up the criteria before the start of the Round 2 auction, expected late this
year. Initial readings suggest that METI is encouraged by the strong BESS showing, but also wants LTDA to
support a wide range of generation sources, including hydro, nuclear, and a revamp of thermal generation via
ammonia co-firing and similar.

Five sectors mandated to put in place data breach measures on economic security
(Nikkei, May 31)
•  Makers of storage batteries, semiconductors, machine tools and industrial robots, advanced
electronics, and aviation components — the sectors covered by the Economic Security Act — will

have to put in place data breach prevention measures.
•  Companies receiving subsidies will report to METI core technologies that will be protected from
potential breach. Required risk management processes include confidentiality agreements with
business partners and prior consultation with METI before ramping up production overseas.
•  If the companies fail to implement sufficient data protection, they might have to return the
subsidies related to economic security.
•  CONTEXT: From May 1, patents on sensitive technologies won't be disclosed, and patent holders

will be banned from applications overseas. However, the govt will compensate patent holders over
possible losses due to these measures. On May 10, the Security Clearance Act, which limits
persons accessing classified data, was enacted.
• TAKEAWAY: Amid speedy development, some sensitive technologies become outdated or irrelevant.
Updating the govt with technology evolution may be complicated as multiple govt agencies will have
oversight. METI handles data protection and export control, while the Cabinet office oversees patent control.




Public-private perovskite council decides six action plans

(Government statement, May 29)
•  The Public-Private Sector Council to Expand Deployment and Strengthen Competitiveness of
Next-Gen Solar Cells”, simply known as the Perovskite Council, came up with six action plans:
o  Learning from past solar policies
o  Setting system installation and price goals
o  Identifying issues on promoting installations
o  Building domestic supply chains

o  Setting overseas business expansion strategies
o  Recycling PSC modules
•  Council meetings won’t be public but reference materials will be disclosed.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toshiba aims for PSC power cost of ¥20/ kWh by 2025
(Company statement, May )

o  In its presentation to the Green Innovation Fund, Toshiba said it will develop PSC
modules that realizes a power generation cost of ¥20/ kWh by 2025.
o  CONTEXT: Reducing the cost of sealing materials used in the PSC module is the key to
the overall cost cut.
• TAKEAWAY: The present 2030 METI target is ¥14/ kWh or less. One PSC researcher told Japan NRG that this
is a “nameplate cost target” disclosed to the public, and there is a separate “real cost target” that’s ¥7/ kWh,

or the cost of nuclear power generation.

(Company statement, May 30)
o  Eight members of the German parliament visited NYK Line to study the application of

ammonia in the transport sector.



Toyota, Mazda and Subaru develop prototypes of alternative-fuel engines
(Company statement, May 28)
•  Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru have developed prototypes of hydrogen-powered internal combustion

engines.
•  Their goal is to develop smaller engines compatible with decarbonization goals and EV platforms.
•  Toyota believes there’s still a market for fuel-burning engines and seeks to create engines that use
various fuels.
•  The automakers showcased compact, powerful engine prototypes, with Subaru maintaining its
signature boxer engine adapted for alternative fuels, such as e-fuel (synthetic fuel), biofuels, and

liquid hydrogen.
• TAKEAWAY: This move is in contrast with many G7 governments that are pushing for the auto sector’s full
electrification. The companies emphasized that these new hydrogen prototypes can be alternatives to EVs and
help decarbonize the car sector.




TSE to expand carbon credit trading by big companies
(Nikkei Asia, May 29)
•  Starting November, TSE plans to revamp Japan's carbon credit market, expanding access to major

companies with high emissions. Since its launch in Oct 2023, the TSE’s carbon market has seen
trading of 310,000 tons of carbon credits.
•  In comparison, South Korea traded 5.7 million tons in the first year. China traded over 170 million
tons in the first six months of its carbon market.
•  Companies that reduce emissions through renewable energy or forest management can trade J-
Credits. Yet, the annual lot of J-Credits is limited to about 1 million tons. So, it restricts market
growth for large emitters.

•  TSE will allow companies in the GX League to participate; these include large emitters such as
Nippon Steel, ENEOS, and TEPCO. They’ll be able to sell surplus credits if they exceed their
emission reduction targets.

BHP, Rio Tinto continue work with Komatsu on large battery-electric haul trucks
(Company statement, May 27)
•  In what is called an “industry first,” BHP and Rio Tinto will cooperate with Komatsu and Caterpillar
on testing large battery-electric haul trucks in Western Australia.
•  CONTEXT: Diesel combustion accounted for about 40% of BHP's Scope 1 and 2 emissions in

FY2020. For Rio Tinto, it accounted for 12% in 2023.
•  Two Komatsu 930 haul trucks will be tested starting in 2026 at mine sites in Western Australia’s
Pilbara region.
•  The mining companies will test battery systems, and static and dynamic charging systems.
•  CONTEXT: In late 2023, Komatsu acquired American Battery Solutions, which has enabled
Komatsu to develop and produce its own battery operated construction and mining equipment.

• TAKEAWAY: The BHP and Rio Tinto collaboration with Komatsu could eventually involve other Western
Australia miners such as Fortescue Metals, further boosting demand for battery-run, heavy-duty equipment.




Japan to invest ¥30 bn in electronic waste recycling system to secure metals
(Nikkei, June 1)
•  The govt will develop a domestic recycling system for electronic waste such as home appliances. It
will invest ¥30 billion over three years to create around 10 reuse centers in partnership with
companies such as Mitsubishi Materials.

•  CONTEXT: Demand for metals is increasing in relation to decarbonization and digitalization. Japan
wants to prevent the outflow overseas of the copper, rare metals etc. in the electronic waste, thus
strengthening economic security.
•  The new initiative will be included in the Basic Plan for Recycling, which will be decided by the
Cabinet in June. The plan will set a new target of increasing the amount of e-waste recycled
domestically to 500,000 tons by 2030. This is 50% more than in 2020.




Osaka Gas signs contract with GS Yuasa for demo of new PCS-combined BESS

EEX to launch options, add fiscal-year annual contracts for electricity futures

(Japan NRG, May 29)
•  The EEX plans to expand clearing services for electricity futures trading in Japan by introducing
annual contracts that run the traditional fiscal year (April to March), and also start offering options
for power trades.
•  The exchange plans to phase out calendar futures, and move to fiscal-year futures to help major
and new power firms synchronize trading with accounting and supply-demand planning.
•  EEX also plans to extend the number of tradable expiries for its seasonal contracts.

•  CONTEXT: EEX estimates it averages a 99% share of the electricity futures trading market in Japan
this year. It currently offers monthly and seasonal electricity futures contracts (summer and winter).
Its most popular contracts are seasonal, but in terms of lots the number of day contracts traded is
growing rapidly, it said.
•  Japan now ranks at No. 7 in terms of countries where EEX offers electricity trading. The bourse has
had 22.25 TWh of Japan power traded on its platform to date in 2024.
•  This year’s average monthly volumes are up 3.5 times from last year to 5.225 TWh; the number of

deals is up to 819 per month from 379 in 2023.
•  As of April 2024, futures volumes are around 25% of the volume on Japan’s spot electricity market
(JEPX), according to EEX. The platform has 74 trading participants from 15 countries. Domestic
players number 34.
• TAKEAWAY: EEX is one of the success stories in the Japanese electricity market. While the govt expected the
domestic TOCOM exchange to dominate, especially due to closer links with major power utilities, the German

company’s ability to adjust its products quickly has met client needs and attracted international traders to
Japan. Expanding the product range to options and offering LNG-based hedging contracts could see its
presence in Japan grow further. Most importantly, the success reflects on how quickly international capital can
galvanize when it sees opportunities in Japan, and these opportunities are opened up to all, not just domestic
players.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
EEX launches subsidiary in Japan
(Company statement, May 30)
o  The European Energy Exchange (EEX) officially opened its subsidiary in Japan to increase
its presence in the market and strengthen ties with local authorities and stakeholders.
o  The move comes as the exchange marks the fourth anniversary of the launch of its

Japanese power derivatives marketplace.
o  Since the launch, it has facilitated trading in 54 TWh of power. The exchange saw a
record volume of 6.6 TWh in February 2024.

J-Power plans ammonia co-firing at Tachibanawan power units
(Tokushima Shimbun, May 31)
•  J-Power plans to launch ammonia-coal co-firing at the No.1 and No. 2 Tachibanawan thermal
power plants (Tokushima Pref) after 2030.
•  The two units each have a 1.05 GW capacity.

•  CONTEXT: J-Power has been conducting ammonia-coal co-firing R&D since 2021. In December,
the company together with Chugai Ro, Osaka University, and Central Research Institute of Electric
Power Industry, were awarded a NEDO project to scale up the co-firing system to 760 kW from the
present 100 kW.
• TAKEAWAY: The two Tachibanawan units will likely require over 1 million tons/ year of ammonia combined at
20% co-firing, assuming they and those of JERA have similar ammonia consumption levels. The Tachibanawan

units are slightly larger than JERA’s 1 GW Hekinan units, suggesting J-Power could possibly become the
largest fuel ammonia consumer depending on the amount of ammonia mixed into the fuel. Combined with
Kobe Steel that also plans ammonia co-firing, the total ammonia demand will be 2.75 million tons/ year at the
ammonia fuel mix ratio of 20%.




OCCTO  seeks new ways to ascertain available capacity for balancing services
(Denki Shimbun, May 31)
•  The Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO) proposed a

new scheme to track medium- to long-term adjustment power capacity using the capacity market
framework.
•  This includes verifying additional information like the presence of adjustment functions during
capacity registration that’s expected to come online.
•  In the capacity market, the upper limit for introducing dispatchable power sources will remain. If
the limit is exceeded, sources with higher effectiveness in past performance tests will be given

priority.
•  Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of capacity for medium- to long-term adjustments,
especially with the increased adoption of renewable energy. OCCTO aims to confirm the readiness
of facilities using the capacity market framework.
•  During a recent meeting, OCCTO outlined a plan to obtain additional information during capacity
registration, including: (1) the presence of adjustment functions; (2) the supply capacity of different
products in the supply-demand adjustment market; and (3) potential capacity after control line

installation.
•  New power sources are required to report estimated capacities.



ANRE proposes to curb soaring prices for tertiary balancing power

(Denki Shimbun, May 28)
•  An ANRE panel seeks to reduce the solicited volume of the tertiary balancing capacity for Day-
Ahead commodities in the balancing market.


10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The market has had shortages in the solicited volume of the tertiary balancing capacity since the
start of a temporary halt of additional procurement on May 1.
•  The suspension should help reduce the weekly procurement of the cross section of secondary and
tertiary products, and to procure an additional amount of the shortfall together with tertiary
products.
•  The proposal includes:

o  Eliminating the large imbalance between the amount of solicitation and the amount of
bids received;
o  Controlling procurement costs, including the use of excess capacity;
o  Maintaining the business feasibility of new resources.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Govt seeks to resume public bidding for pumped storage power

(Denki Shimbun, May 29)
o  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) discussed resumption of
the public solicitation for balancing power that ended in March in order to attract more
bids for pumped storage resources in the balancing market.
o  The decrease in the volume of bids received is due to the fact that the operating entity of
pumped storage will change from FY2024, and the weight is shifting to price difference

transactions in the wholesale power market.
o  They discussed the possibility of setting a cap on pumped storage capacity procured by
general transmission and distribution firms and capping the procurement period under a
single contract to encourage competition among generators.




JEPX sees sharp decline in trade of non-fossil certificates in FY2023
(Power market information, May 28)
•  JEPX results of the final trade in the Non-Fossil Fuel Value Trading Market for FY2023 show that
the average volume of non-FIT, non-fossil certificates dropped by 85.2% from the previous time to
177.09 GWh.
•  The majority of retail electricity suppliers are believed to have increased procurement through

other arrangements, resulting in a low commitment volume. But the volume of FIT certificates
remained brisk at around 8.4 TWh.
•  The advanced market for FIT certificates that handles non-renewables sources, and which is mainly
nuclear-derived, saw a 92.7% drop from the previous survey to 2.2 GWh.
•  The renewables designation market, which includes large hydropower plants, also saw a sharp
decline of 82.5% to 149 GWh. In both cases, all purchase bids were executed, with the price
sticking to the lower limit of ¥0.6.

•  The fourth contracted volume in renewables, where FIT certificates are traded, increased by 2.9%
to 8.48 TWh. Contract price was at the lower limit of ¥0.4.
•  CONTEXT: It appears that most retail electricity providers had procured power in advance through
relative arrangements such as off-site PPAs, because despite preliminary estimates suggesting
tight supply-demand balance in the final auction, the number of purchase bids was only slightly
higher than expected.

• TAKEAWAY: JERA’s entry into the retail electricity market to support the corporate green transformation is
causing concern among existing power companies. JERA’s move is expected to intensify competition and

reshape the retail electricity landscape.




ORIX to build one of Japan’s largest energy storage facilities
(Company statement, May 30)
•  ORIX will build one of Japan’s largest energy storage facilities, (output 134 MW), in Maibara City
(Shiga Pref). Construction begins in autumn; operations set for 2027.
•  Earlier this year, the company secured capacity for the Maibara-Koto Energy Storage Plant in
Japan’s first long-term decarbonized power auction (LTDA) that seeks to encourage investments

into decarbonized energy sources.
•  ORIX will lease about 26 km2 owned by Maibara City to build the plant, which will have 140
containers of lithium-ion storage batteries on the premises.
•  CONTEXT: Since April 21, the govt has incentivized 27 grid-scale battery storage projects and
awarded a total output of 1.09 GW across 30 BESS projects in its inaugural LTDA. By 2030, Japan
expects BESS energy capacity to grow in the range of 14.1 to 23.8 GWh.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
The Outlook for Japan’s Next Energy Strategy

Only three years have passed since Japan wrote its Sixth Basic Energy Plan, but that
short period has proven to be highly eventful and decisive for Japan’s plans to
transition to clean energy. Now the time has come for a seventh edition of the Plan,
taking into account the new realities on the ground and more forceful and binding
energy policies approved by allies and partners.

While Japan’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal is written into law, the Basic Energy Plan,
which is the national long-term energy strategy, is currently not legally binding. Faced
with a geopolitically tumultuous past three years, the government of Prime Minister
Kishida has had to deviate significantly from the Sixth Plan that was written in 2021,
which, for example, called for reducing reliance on nuclear power.

More clarity for the essence of the upcoming Seventh Basic Energy Plan came on May
13 when Kishida spelled out the main direction, stating that there’ll be a grand
national strategy showing pathways to a ‘green’ industrial revolution, or in his words,
“big socioeconomic changes integrated with green transformation (GX)”.

Accompanying that strategy will be an energy plan that Kishida has dubbed “GX 2.0”,
which will show specific transition pathways. Just a few days later, the 16 members of
the Strategic Policy Committee of Natural Resources and Energy, who will write the
updated energy plan, kicked off their official discussions. Japan NRG studied their
preliminary talking points.


Outlook for 2040
The basic theme of the upcoming Seventh Basic Energy Plan (also sometimes referred
to as the Strategic Energy Plan) reveals Japan’s energy landscape through 2040. This
is a stretch in the time frame – the previous plan was based on 2030 scenarios. The
official rationale for making 2040 the target year is that due to the magnitude of the
transitions, a clearer outlook for 2040 is needed to develop greater visibility for the
next ten years, through 2035.

The reality that’s been hitting hard is the fact that industries need more time to come
up with energy transition strategies that are economically viable. At the May 15
meeting, Hashimoto Eiji, the Nippon Steel president, said businesses need to make
investment decisions this year for projects that will come to fruition in the 2030’s
because it takes years to implement any new initiative.

Nippon Steel is one of the country’s top emitters, but also one of the biggest
employers and energy users, with several in-house thermal power generation facilities.
The steel firm, like its domestic peers, is working on the technology, supply chain, and
economics of switching some of its manufacturing processes to hydrogen instead of
coal.




18



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

However, due to a lack of visibility over green power volumes and green hydrogen
supplies in the years ahead, companies like Nippon Steel say they can’t make
decisions about 2030 projects.

“Companies might as well go overseas,” Hashimoto warned.

Another reality faced by big manufacturers is that several nuclear plants, which tend to
provide lower-cost baseload power, will start to reach the end of their permit lives
from the late 2030s. Plans for new reactor constructions are uncertain, and if nuclear is
to remain a key part of the energy mix, these projects need to start today.

“Decarbonization tech development is Japan’s last chance for economic recovery,”
said Hashimoto.

The dilemma here is that clean energy is needed for any net zero solution
development and that scale of investment will need to be recouped. Japan is also
finally starting to grapple with inflation after almost three decades without upward
price pressure. That’s a worry for the impact on electricity costs for energy-intensive
industries.


“With all prices going up, it will be impossible to keep energy prices down”, said Ito
Mami, representative director of Nihon Dento Kougyo, which electroplates electrical
and electronic parts.

There is a genuine threat of clean power shortages and difficult decisions may have to
be made over which industries get access to this decarbonized energy. “Either we
start investing into clean power sources [now] or it will be too late,” Ito added.

Several other members stressed the need for the government to provide “visibility” to
businesses to spur capital investments.

Varied “visibility” requirements
So what exactly is the visibility the businesses crave to invest in power sources?
Writing a 2040 energy mix reflecting ambitions to boost decarbonized power hardly
contributes to improved visibility, as businesses are skeptical that this plan will actually
unfold. Companies developing power sources need confidence of demand and
market design.

Takamura Yukari, professor of Tokyo University, said the bottom line of any power mix
scenario is creating structures of industries that will allow Japanese companies to win
in global markets. This reflected a shift in government thinking in recent months to
align decarbonization strategies with those for industrial and digital developments.


Big industrial and digital energy buyers require a different kind of visibility, according
to Japan’s top telecommunications group NTT and chemical major Asahi Kasei, who
voiced their priority as not only cheap and green, but also stable power prices.

Sawada Jun, the chairman of NTT, known as Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, called
for further reform of the power sector to create better interconnection between the
nation’s grids, allowing electricity to move around the country more efficiently.
19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

“Supply chains are building up in Japan thanks to the weak yen, but the high power
rates are discouraging businesses,” Sawada said. Kobori Hideki, the chairman of Asahi
Kasei, added that on his wishlist was reducing the volatility of electricity prices.

One thing the government could do to balance competing energy needs is curb
power demand growth, according to Takamura and Kudo Teiko, the deputy president
of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. Further clarify around the nuclear business
environment should improve visibility for all sides, noted Kurosaki Ken, a Kyoto
University professor.

Other suggestions included government moves to encourage industries to relocate
into areas with abundant renewables power and creating frameworks to spur non-
fossil power investments.

Thermal power comeback?
Some members were indirectly taking shots at the Sixth Plan which put renewables as
the primary power source with 36-38% of the power mix in 2030. Nippon Steel’s
Hashimoto, for example, said one should forget about putting “renewables first” and
conduct an “objective” analysis of the energy reality.

Rising national security risks have underscored the importance of fossil fuel, added
Professor Yamauchi Hirotaka of Hitotsubashi University. Waseda University Professor
Endo Noriko suggested keeping coal out of the energy mix, but still holding onto coal
generation assets in reserve, rather than dismantling them entirely.


The experts also itemized actions to take without waiting for 2040, pointing out:
•  There are interconnection hiccups between the regional utilities, due to the
system specifications, limiting the sharing of electricity between regions;
•  Nuclear power plants need to restart in significant numbers;
•  Siting of new nuclear reactors is problematic and creating facilities offshore
should be considered;
•  Nuclear fusion development requires more structured planning.

The panel’s wish list is long and could get longer, but it all comes down to who is
going to implement the plans.

Who’s in charge?
Effective May 15, Sumi Shuzo, the advisor to Tokio Marine and Nichido Fire Insurance,
replaced Shiraishi Takashi, Kumamoto University professor, as chairman of the
Strategic Policy Committee of Natural Resources and Energy, the main export
advisory panel for the energy strategy process. The change possibly reflected METI’s
intention to show that big businesses matter, some observers say.

There will also be changes in the policy making responsibilies. Traditionally, the
Ministry of Environment and METI have shared the climate policy making arena. It was
not always clear how the two ministries’ roles differed, as the MoE was active also in
the energy industry, for example by providing subsidies to Power Purchase
Agreement projects, carbon capture and storage studies and EV and FCV promotion.


20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The two ministries jointly oversee the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) system and
MoE Minister’s input is required for decisions on big renewables projects.

However, another document published very recently by the MoE suggests that the
above roles are starting to shift.

On May 21, the MoE published the Sixth Basic Environment Plan, written by the
Comprehensive Policy Sub-Committee of the Central Environment Council. Takamura
of Tokyo University chairs that Sub-Committee.

The plan, which is updated every six years, puts expanding renewables as one of the
key solutions to achieving man’s harmonious cohabitation with nature. But the latest
edition was directed more on nature and biodiversity issues and touched much less on
energy production and distribution.

While the MoE will surely remain committed to promoting offshore wind projects in
Exclusive Economic Zone waters, and installing solar panels in government offices and
facilities, its hands-on role in major energy projects seems reduced. Even when
discussing the hot issue of the day – how to power an upcoming boom in AI and IoT –
the Environmental Plan referred only to technologies' role in finding solutions for
environmental issues and glazed over power supply constraints.


Japan NRG believes the roles of the two ministries will demarcate as METI uses its
administrative “muscles” to support the larger-scale energy projects, industrial
strategy and infrastructure building. Meanwhile, the MoE will focus on nature
conservation, biodiversity, and CO2 monitoring.

Funding Fusion: Japan Seeks to Stay Competitive in the Global Race

Until recently, nuclear fusion was a little-discussed topic in Japan. Widely seen as a
technology with great promise but only a distant future, fusion has long been on the
fringes of Japan’s clean energy transition debate. That’s now changing.

In 2022, Japan began to outline a nuclear fusion strategy, releasing a draft in 2023.
Today, there’s a burgeoning ecosystem of startups that are trialing various ways to
achieve energy’s holy grail. However, research and experiments come with a cost, and
in the case of fusion that’s quite high. Movement in financing is in the very early
stages.

Other factors are helping accelerate Japan’s fusion sector footprint. A recent founding
of an industry group, J-Fusion, will not only help give the tech a stronger voice in
official energy discussions domestically, but aims to bolster domestic players as they
keep pace with international rivals.

Japan NRG takes an in-depth look at the achievements to date and challenges yet to
be overcome.


Fusion council unites major players
Fusion’s tantalizing allure is its promise to generate boundless energy from small
amounts of fuel with no CO2 emissions, and with relatively little radioactive waste.
While conventional nuclear fission requires constant monitoring to prevent radiation
leaks, fusion reactions cease when fuel injections stop, thereby avoiding the risk of
meltdowns.

Like the Sun and other stars, nuclear fusion's basic principle is to create energy by
coaxing hydrogen nuclei inside the isotopes tritium and deuterium, and fusing them
into helium. Hydrogen can be retrieved from seawater, and a gram of fuel could
theoretically release as much energy as eight tons of oil.

In 2022, fusion logged a milestone that generated much excitement when the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the U.S. managed to produce more
energy than was used to start the reaction. The results were small (around 1 MJ of
energy was generated), did not include the energy volumes required to power the
equipment, and not easily replicable. But this milestone still sparked enthusiasm for
subsequent research.

On the back of this, fusion startups, especially in North America, have raised
impressive amounts. In 2021, about $2.6 billion of investment flowed into fusion-
related firms, Crunchbase data show. Since then, the total annual dollar amount has
declined, but the number of deals keeps growing.

Realizing that Japan was lagging behind some of its G7 allies, on March 29, 2024 the
government helped to set up an organization dedicated to promoting nuclear fusion
power. The Japan Fusion Energy Council (J-Fusion) seeks to stimulate the

J-Fusion will focus on the industry’s technological needs, as well as gathering
expertise and resources. Moreover, the group will help the government to set
regulations and technological standards. But perhaps the council’s most crucial
mission will be to secure funding for the domestic sector to stay competitive with
international peers.

Stepping stones to the mainstream
While the U.S. and Europe are making progress, Japan's fusion industry is playing
catch-up. In 2018, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
(MEXT) released its first roadmap for a demo fusion reactor, but it set the goal of
achieving power generation only in 2050. The fact that MEXT, rather than METI, was
in charge of the roadmap highlighted the more academic bent of Japan’s fusion R&D
at the time.

Government interest firmed up after the 2022 breakthroughs in the U.S. By April 2023,
a Fusion Energy Innovation Strategy was unveiled – this time, by the Cabinet Office.
The latter has great authority but less technical expertise, and so the Strategy was
useful in noting the need for Japan to become more serious about fusion, but lacked
any details on timelines, funding, or concrete action plans.

Still, the promotion of fusion to the Cabinet’s attention served the purpose of putting
fusion energy on the radar of the energy planners and linked it directly to the
country’s clean energy future. It also hinted at the delays in Japan’s fusion R&D in
comparison to the goals set by other countries. China, the U.S. and U.K., for example,
plan to succeed in fusion power generation by 2040.

According to METI, a key part of fusion’s development rests on being able to make
technological and material advances that will allow fusion plasma to sustain itself after
the initial ignition stops. This is where Japan may hold a comparative global
advantage as it has a rich ecosystem of materials companies.


But before Japan moves to the stage of testing fusion in a demo reactor, to prove the
tech’s practical application and economic viability, the government wants to gather
experience via international collaboration projects.

ITER’s ‘sister’ in Japan
To date, Japan's main activity in the realm of fusion comprises its membership in the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). Tokyo hopes that ITER's
research can help Japan build a prototype reactor. However, budget issues and
technical problems have delayed ITER’s operations from the original deadline of 2025.

ITER's fusion ‘sister’, the JT-60SA reactor, is a joint project with the EU and located in
Naka (Ibaraki Pref); it aims to provide plasma consistently. Plasma is the key
component inside the tokamak, a special reactor for nuclear fusion. Generating
plasma results in superhot gas of ions and electrons that’s magnetically kept separate
from the tokamak’s walls.

In October 2023, JT-60SA achieved its first plasma, heated at 200 million C. Next is
the second stage: building and testing an experimental fusion reactor.

The JT-60SA fusion project in Japan


















Source: ITER

While the government’s attention has been primarily on international collaborations
and grand strategies, a small ecosystem of about half a dozen fusion startups has
managed to take root in Japan within a time. These include Kyoto Fusioneering,
Helical Fusion, Ex-Fusion, and MiRESSO. Others, like Blue Laser Fusion are based
overseas but have a strong Japanese team or Japanese investors, or both.

Arguably the most ambitious plans, in terms of speed of development, as from Helical
Fusion, which seeks to launch a pilot fusion power generation facility as soon as 2034.
Unlike the ITER and JT-60SA projects, which use the more traditional donut-shaped
tokamak machine design, Helical Fusion is experimenting with installing helical coils
that create a magnetic field to confine the plasma. While a tokamak needs a heating
device to confine plasma for long periods, the coils promise to work more efficiently
long-term, although they have their own drawbacks.

A third method involves focusing lasers to irradiate a fuel pellet of tritium and
deuterium to incite fusion; this is the method that the U.S. laboratory used in 2022 for
its breakthrough. Unlike the tokamak and helical coil approaches, the application of
lasers is constrained by security issues since the process can also be diverted for
military purposes. Still, the Osaka University startup, EX-Fusion, is working on this
method.

Industry experts say it is crucial to continue researching all three technologies. The
final goal is the same: replicate on an industrial scale that which was achieved in the
laboratory.

Crunching the numbers
In 2023, total investments into the fusion industry grew 27% worldwide, with the U.S.
Fusion Industry Association claiming that private inflows reached over $6 billion.

U.S.-based Commonwealth Fusion Systems and TAE Technologies had secured over
$3.2 billion in funding as of June 2023. ENN Science and Technology Development of
China secured $400 million, and the U.K.’s Tokamak Energy $250 million.

In contrast, Japanese companies have raised only $98 million, with more than 90% of
that going to a single player, Kyoto Fusioneering. That’s a paltry amount given that six
to seven times that may be required to build a demo reactor. If more funding is not
forthcoming, Japanese firms in the sector won’t be able to compete globally.


Despite this, Japan could still carve out its own space in a future fusion industry as a
producer of materials or components. It’s interesting to note the significant presence
of entities from the material sectors in J-Fusion’s membership list.

For example, Furukawa Electric produces superconductor wires for fusion reactors,
including the ones for ITER. Recently, MHI supplied an additional batch of divertors
for the ITER tokamak. In similar fashion, Japan has already positioned itself as an
exporter of parts for traditional nuclear power plants.

Benefits from pursuing fusion R&D are not limited to creating a new kind of power
plant. The technologies developed for fusion can be applied in other industries. For
instance, MiRESSO, a startup based in Misawa city (Aomori Pref.) specializes in

26



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

refining beryllium, an element that’s essential for fusion. MiRESSO’s innovative work,
however, could also help with processing critical energy transition metals like nickel.

Since commercial nuclear fusion is not on the near-term horizon, investing in this
energy source will require a long, long-term strategy. In the meantime, presenting a
national strategy and creating industry-wide initiatives like J-Fusion will serve mainly
one purpose: igniting more interest in government circles and private sector
partnerships in the hopes of securing more funding. That should help inch the industry
towards realizing Japan’s fusion goals.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Renewable energy
By 2033, non-hydropower renewable energy capacity is expected to reach 101 GW,
which is more than double over the current 46 GW. Strong state policy support is
cited as the reason for this expected progress.

China / Emissions
China aims to reduce CO2 emissions of key industries equal to about 1% of the 2023
national total by improving efficiency in every sector ranging from steel production to
transportation. The govt action plan says the economy will require 2.5% less energy
for every unit of GDP growth in 2024.

China / Renewable energy
Chinese renewable products exports grew by 35% from 2019 to 2023 due to their
competitive prices and production capacity, with local manufacturers supplying over
65% of total global demand. Wood Mackenzie said that manufacturing costs in China
were as much as fourfold lower compared to Western firms in the sector.

India / Solar power
Avaada Energy, a leading player in the renewable energy sector and an arm of
Avaada Group won the single largest bid of 1.05 GW capacity in a recent solar
capacity tender. Avaada now has Letters of Award and PPAs for over 15 GW in India.

Indonesia / Renewable energy
Abu Dhabi-based Masdar signed an MoU with Pertamina Power Indonesia to develop
solar, wind, and green hydrogen projects in the country and abroad, banking on its
current partnership with Pertamina Geothermal Energy.

Oil
In May, Asia's imports of crude oil rose to their highest in 12 months, driven by
demand from India. Asia is expected to have arrivals of 27.81 million bpd, up from
26.89 mln bpd in April, said LSEG Oil Research. That's an MoM increase of 920,000
bpd, with most accounted for by India, where imports are expected to rise to an all-
time high of 5.26 mln bpd, up 710,000 bpd from April's 4.55 mln bpd.

Philippines / Offshore energy
Billionaire Ramon Ang called on Manila to disregard tensions with China and develop
untapped offshore oil and natural gas reserves. Such a move, however, would require
joint maritime patrols with the U.S. to deter the Chinese coast guard. China has
competing claims with the Philippines in the South China Sea.

Southeast Asia / LNG
High temperatures are driving up LNG demand as importers seek supplies as summer
begins; imports are hitting record highs amid intense air-conditioner use. Prices are
now at a six-month peak above $12/ mmBtu and are expected to remain elevated.

South Korea / UAE cooperation
The UAE will invest $30 billion in South Korea spanning the nuclear power, defence,
hydrogen and solar energy sectors. UAE President bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited Seoul
for the occasion. South Korea already has contracts to build nuclear reactors in the
UAE.

Vietnam / Coal power
As factories owned by some of the world's leading tech firms face weeks of blackouts,
coal-fired power plants are making up for the demand. Coal power accounts for just
over a third of Vietnam's total installed power generation capacity, but in recent
weeks coal has generated around 67% of total national electricity output.
