NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





JERA launches commercial sales of power generated with hydrogen fuel

(Company statement, Nov 29)
•  Toho Co and JERA launched Japan’s first commercial supply of electricity from a hydrogen-fired
power plant, providing energy to Toho Studios in Tokyo.
•  The hydrogen-fired unit at the Sodegaura Thermal Power Plant includes a 320 kW gas engine and
two 35 kW fuel cells, which are expected to deliver about 1 GWh a year. Hydrogen is delivered via
tanker trucks with a total capacity of 12,000 Nm³.
•  Toho Studio also purchases electricity from JERA’s solar farms and has set an initial target of

sourcing 60-70% of its energy from low carbon sources. The film company wants to rely on
electricity from renewables and hydrogen entirely by 2030.
•  CONTEXT: Toho Studios is one of Japan's most renowned and historic film and TV production
companies. Established in 1932, it’s been a cornerstone of Japan’s film industry, famous for
producing numerous iconic films and franchises such as the Godzilla series.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

MHI milestone: operating ultra-high pressure liquid hydrogen booster pump
(Company statement, Nov 28)
o  MHI completed 1,200 hours of operation in durability tests for its 90 MPa-class ultra-high
pressure liquid hydrogen booster pump, demonstrating reliability in handling large flow
rates (160 kg/ hour) at extreme conditions (-253°C).
o  The pump will be delivered to a large-scale hydrogen station in Japan by April 2025,
marking its first commercial application. It consumes just 25% of the energy needed for

gaseous hydrogen boosting, resulting in lower environmental impact.
o  Tests confirmed virtually no hydrogen loss owing to boil-off gas.
• TAKEAWAY: These are very early days for hydrogen-fired power generation, and there are many unknowns,
including how much Toho studios is spending on this system. It’s likely that the publicity is worth more to JERA
than margins, at least for now. The bigger
test will come when power users try to pass
on their improved sustainability as a cost to

customers. The transport sector will be one
to watch in this regard. However, another
point of interest here is the combination of
solar with hydrogen, which theoretically
covers peak and base load, as well as
seasonal variations. Should it prove

commercially viable, this will be a large
market opportunity.

FEPC head calls for more nuclear power in next Basic Energy Plan
(Company statement, Nov 29)
•  Hayashi Kingo, chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan (and president of
Chubu Electric), urged the govt to promote and support nuclear energy as a "power source to be

used as much as possible" in its next Basic Energy Plan.
•  He suggested removing the phrase "reduce dependence on nuclear power as much as possible."
Hayashi also wants the promotion of new construction and the replacement of aging nuclear plants
with modern ones.
•  Hayashi says opinions on energy demand and nuclear energy have shifted since 2021 due to
increased importance of decarbonization and economic security.
•  CONTEXT: The govt plans to complete the next energy plan in FY2024, setting the power supply

composition for 2040. Discussions about reducing nuclear dependence remain contentious.
• TAKEAWAY: The opinions of the big power utility lobby and the big business lobby (Keidanren) have changed
little in recent years. They are steadfast supporters of a continued reliance on nuclear energy. The question is
how much influence they have on the new government. This has become much more difficult to answer with
the changed political landscape. So far, indications are that there are more pro-nuclear lawmakers in
parliament than anti. The ultimate litmus test, however, will be what happens to the Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP.




Govt approves economic measures, resumes subsidies for electricity and gas bills
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 25)
•  The govt approved a comprehensive economic package on Nov 22, including the resumption of
subsidies for electricity and city gas bills from January to March 2025.
•  Subsidies will focus on peak winter months, reducing low-voltage electricity rates by ¥2.5/ kWh in
January and February, and ¥1.3 in March. Standard households are expected to save ¥1,000

monthly on electricity and ¥300 on gas during peak months.
•  The plan emphasizes energy resilience, promoting energy efficiency and maximizing the use of
renewables and nuclear power for decarbonization.
•  Public investment exceeding ¥10 trillion is planned by 2030 for AI and semiconductor sectors,
along with infrastructure upgrades to support data centers and increased power demand in
regional areas.



Osaka Gas to build supply chain for e-methane

(Nikkei, Nov 30)
•  Osaka Gas plans to set up a supply network for e-methane, investing about ¥100 billion in the U.S.
to build production facilities and secure hydrogen, the primary raw material, at lower costs
compared to domestic sources.
•  Leveraging existing infrastructure, Osaka Gas plans to import e-methane and meet over 60% of its
domestic introduction target for 2030.
•  CONTEXT: E-methane is a next-gen urban gas pivotal to decarbonization; it is synthesized by

combining hydrogen and CO2. By utilizing CO2 recovered from industrial sources, the process can
offset the CO2 emissions generated when e-methane is burned as city gas, effectively achieving
carbon neutrality.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s gas utilities have pushed e-methane as a decarbonization solution very strongly in the last
year or so. One of the attractions for the companies is the ability to blend it into existing gas networks,
retaining infrastructure that has taken decades to build up. The current Basic Energy Plan calls for e-methane
to account for 1% of city gas by 2030, which is what Osaka Gas investment seems to address. The bigger
question is what happens after the end of this decade. Is there an economic and technical pathway for e-

methane to play more than a minor role?



JERA and Tokyo Metro ink virtual solar PPA
(Company statement, Nov 26)
•  JERA signed a 25-year virtual power purchase agreement with Tokyo Metro, providing
environmental value from solar power to reduce Tokyo Metro's CO2 emissions by approximately
936 tons annually starting in December.

•  Through its subsidiary JERA Cross, JERA will supply 2.4 GWh annually of non-fossil fuel certificates,
enabling Tokyo Metro to count this energy as renewable without altering its existing electricity
contracts.
•  Tokyo Metro will be the first in the Japanese railway industry to utilize the renewable energy data
management solution provided by Granular Energy (a French startup).



Firms cooperate on solar panel reuse and recycling in Fukuoka Pref

(Nikkei, Nov 25)
•  Kitakyushu City (Fukuoka Pref) agreed with Hamada, a recycling company, and Shinryo, a
subsidiary of Mitsubishi Chemical Group, to cooperate on solar panel recycling and reuse.
•  Hamada collects discarded but operational solar panels. Shinryo takes panels that can’t be reused
and extracts the glass, copper, silver, etc.
•  Although solar panel reuse has not developed due to quality concerns, Kitakyushu City seeks to
pioneer the reuse of solar panels and to create a model for solving the problem of large-scale
panel disposal.

•  CONTEXT: Solar panel lifespan is estimated to be 20 to 30 years, but in practice, panels are often
replaced with more powerful ones every 10 years due to innovations. The number of panels to be
discarded is expected to increase fivefold by the 2040s.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Osaka Gas invests in Australian startup to develop solar thermal systems
(Company statement, Nov 26)
o  Osaka Gas has invested in Australian startup FPR Energy, a developer of concentrated

solar thermal systems that uses ceramic particles as a heat medium.
o  FPR’s system uses stable ceramic particles to achieve high-temperature heat transfer (up
to 1,200°C) and efficient heat exchange.
o  Osaka Gas will combine this tech with its expertise in gas cogeneration and boilers to
enhance energy stability.

Itochu signs MoU with Saudi firm to develop water and renewables projects
(New Energy Business News, Nov 26)
•  Itochu inked an MoU with Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power, the Middle East’s largest independent
power producer and world’s largest desalination company.
•  The agreement focuses on strategic collaboration in water, environmental, and renewable energy

projects, particularly in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. The MoU was signed during
COP29 in Baku.
•  CONTEXT: Based in Riyadh, ACWA Power's portfolio of about 90 projects in operation and
development has an investment value of $86 billion, and a capacity of 55 GW of power and 8
million m3/ day of desalinated water.



JR to test hydrogen-powered vehicles

(Company statement, Nov 26)
•  Central Japan Railway Company is developing hydrogen-powered vehicles to replace diesel-
powered railcars.
•  Based on the HC85 series hybrid system, these vehicles will be able to utilize both fuel cells and
hydrogen engines as power sources.
•  CONTEXT: Fuel cells are efficient, produce no emissions during use, and they power electric
motors through an electrochemical process; typically used for cars and buses. In contrast,

hydrogen engines are similar to internal combustion engines; they offer higher energy density and
are thus used for heavy-duty vehicles and heavy loads.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Tokio Marine offers risk assessment in hydrogen and ammonia supply networks
(Nikkei, Nov 29)
o  Starting December, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance will offer a service to analyze
risks in hydrogen and ammonia supply networks, including fires, leaks, and explosions,

helping businesses stabilize operations and plan safety measures.
o  The service will simulate accidents during procurement, transportation, and usage,
estimate damage costs, and assist in prevention strategies and evacuation plans.
o  The service will focus on ammonia and later expand to hydrogen and CO2 management
technologies like CCS and CCU.



NYK Line seeks to develop world’s biggest ship recycling capacity

(Nikkei Asia, Nov 26)
•  Nippon Yusen (NYK Line) plans to dismantle ships and large marine structures, and recycle high-
purity iron in Aichi Pref starting 2028.
•  This initiative aims to establish the world's largest ship recycling capacity. It could handle 300,000
tons of scrap iron per year.
•  The recycled iron will help Japan shift toward electric furnaces in the steel industry.
•  CONTEXT: This manual-intensive industry is currently dominated by Bangladesh and India.

KEPCO and RWE plan to build 1.68 GW offshore wind farm off Hokkaido coast

(Company statement, Nov 25)
•  Kansai Electric and RWE Renewables Japan plan to build an offshore wind farm with a capacity of
1.68 GW off Hiyama, Hokkaido. On Nov 25, they released an Environmental Impact Assessment for
the project.
•  Up to 120 wind turbines, each 14 to 24 MW capacity, will be installed. Foundation types under
consideration include monopile, jacket, and gravity-based structures.
•  CONTEXT: Hiyama offshore has been designated as a "promising area" by METI. Several other
companies plan developments in the same regions such as Cosmo Eco Power and Hokkaido

Electric, which announced its plan earlier this week. The govt will upgrade the site to a “promotion
zone”, and feed-in-premium (FIP) subsidies will be awarded to projects through a public tender run
by METI/MLIT.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hokkaido Electric plans a 1.14 GW offshore wind farm
(Company statement, Nov 26)
o  Hokkaido Electric submitted to METI, and local state agencies, an Environmental Impact

Assessment for a wind project off the coast of Hiyama, Hokkaido.
o  The offshore wind project spans over 20,000 hectares off the coasts of Setana, Yakumo,
Esashi, and Kaminokuni towns. It aims for a maximum capacity of 1.14 GW, with up to 76
wind turbines, each 15–20 MW capacity.
o  The firm has not chosen a foundation structure.
• TAKEAWAY: Offshore wind developers are pushing METI to start opening up the Hokkaido areas to auctions.

The ministry’s reticence so far has been a lack of clarity on when an underwater sea cable would be built to
bring this power from Hokkaido seas to the industrial areas of Kanto. However, the development of a
semiconductor manufacturing cluster in Hokkaido is proving that there are willing electricity buyers closer to
home, which may give officials confidence that some Hokkaido offshore projects can proceed sooner rather
than later.



OCCTO  will revise method to calculate penalties in capacity market

(OCCTO statement, Nov 25)
•  Within the next 12 months, OCCTO will revise a section of the Supply Capacity Provision Notice
and the method for calculating penalties.
•  This notice covers the period from 18:00 on the previous day until the gates close if the reserve
margin for the area falls below 8%.
•  OCCTO wants to keep in mind that reserve margins can still be improved if the use of surplus

pumped storage capacity is brought forward. In other words, pumped hydro plants are used earlier
than initially forecast.

8



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Operators of stable power sources will be subject to a penalty if they do not participate in market
bidding during periods of low reserve margin.
•  The current calculation method assumes that a low reserve margin time is 30 hours, based on past
performance.
• TAKEAWAY: Starting FY2024, pumped storage has been operated by the balancing group (BG) of power

generation companies. TSOs can utilize pumped storage within a range of surplus capacity as notified by the
BG. If the range of available capacity notified by the BG is small, the reserve margin decreases. Once the
reserve margin falls below 5%, operations of pumped storage will switch to TSOs. For this winter, however,
there is a provisional measure: the threshold for the switch in operations has been raised to 8%. It is possible
that it’ll remain at 8% from now on.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
OCCTO improves renewable energy forecasting
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 27)
o  OCCTO reported progress on enhancing renewable energy forecasting, which could
help reduce the need for tertiary balancing power. The initiative uses a new method
called "confidence-level classification forecasting."
o  This method, adopted nationwide in 2023, separates solar forecasting errors into "high"

and "low" confidence categories, and adjusts the required balancing power.
o  Under a NEDO-backed program (2021–2024), the goal is to cut maximum forecasting
errors by over 20%, leveraging specialized weather models.
o  These improvements reduced the annual tertiary power requirements by 28% in FY2023,
with Kansai Electric leading trials to expand this forecasting technique.
• TAKEAWAY: OCCTO has struggled to raise usage of the EPRX balancing market. This effort is about boosting

the volume of renewable energy utilized as a balancing reserve, which would give TSOs more flexibility.
However, improving the confidence of TSOs is key. The involvement of Kansai Electric should be taken as a
good signal for potential adoption in other parts of the country.



Toho Gas to join capacity market using VPP services

(Nikkei, Nov 29)
•  Toho Gas is entering the capacity market where it will utilize its virtual power plant (VPP) service,
"Waketoku," that aggregates and controls home storage batteries as a unified power source.
•  This marks Japan's first power purchase service using household batteries as part of a VPP. The
secured capacity will be sold to OCCTO and become available four years from now.
•  The company’s VPP service, launched in October, aggregates and controls household batteries to
function as a single power source. The initiative is run in partnership with electrical equipment
manufacturer, Omron Group.

•  Targeting households in Aichi, Gifu, and Mie, "Waketoku" remotely controls storage batteries to
discharge during tight supply-demand situations, offering a purchase price ¥3 higher per kWh than
the standard rate. It is especially used during power shortages.

Osaka retailer to enter BESS sector, secures bank financing for merchant units
(Company statement, Nov 27)
•  Osaka based retailer, Energy Power, plans to enter the battery energy storage system (BESS)
market by acquiring and commissioning two projects before Sept 2026.
•  The projects, located in Asago and Tamba cities in Hyogo Prefecture, will both have 1.979 MW

capacity and 8.226 MWh storage, with construction scheduled from February to June 2025.
•  The Asago plant (¥809 million acquisition cost) will be built by East Engineering, while the Tamba
plant (¥800 million) will be constructed by BS POWER, on 1,151 m² and 1,787 m² sites respectively.
•  Energy Power said it secured two 17-year loans totaling ¥748M: a ¥600 million facility from Kiyo
Bank and a ¥148 million facility from Japan Finance Corp.
•  The two BESS projects will trade power in the wholesale, balancing, and capacity markets to

capture demand for grid-stabilizing solutions.
• TAKEAWAY: The most impressive part of this news is probably the financing details. These show that the
retailer was able to secure long-term bank loans for close to half of the investment amount for BESS that,
according to the statement, will be operating a full-merchant model. In other words, it will trade the electricity
in the market and not rely on a long-term contract with an anchor buyer or a state subsidy. Banks have so far
been hesitant to expose themselves to market risk in the power sector. After a decade of financing solar and

wind projects on an FIT basis with predictable cash flows, it will take a while for lenders to adjust to the new
risk levels. However, this deal indicates that there is some move in this direction. If this were to happen more
widely, more BESS developers may consider options outside of the LTDA and similar subsidy schemes to aim
for higher margins.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Toshiba wins Orix contract to build 134 MW BESS project
(Company statement, Nov 25)
o  Toshiba Plant Systems & Services won an engineering, procurement, construction, and
commissioning (EPCC) contract from an Orix-related SPC for a 134 MW/ 548 MWh grid-
connected BESS project in Maihara City, Shiga Pref.
o  CONTEXT: This will be one of the largest BESS facilities in Japan once complete. It was

the biggest BESS to be awarded a subsidy in Round 1 of the LTDA tenders, the results of
which were announced at the start of this year.
o  The project is located in the Kansai TSO area and has a 26,000 m2 land plot leased from
Maibara City. It involves installing 140 lithium-ion battery containers and is due to be
completed in November 2026.



Power spot market offers are down amid declining supply and sustained demand
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 26)
•  In October, JEPX reported a 13.6% MoM drop in average daily sell offers, totaling 999.75 GWh;

and a 10.7% decrease in buy offers, totaling 893.05 GWh. Despite lower volumes, unseasonably
high temperatures led to stronger buying activity early and mid-month as thermal power output
declined.
•  Compared to October 2023, sell offers rose 0.5%, while buy offers surged 18.4%, reflecting robust
demand. The pause on gross bidding, in effect since October 2023, influenced these dynamics.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Total monthly sale volume fell 10.8% over September to a total of 30.99 TWh, while the buy
volume declined 7.7% to 27.68 TWh.
•  Peak-hour sell offers dropped 12.9%, with nighttime offers declining the most at 18%.
•  Supply tightness eased later in the month as sell offers increased, but earlier mismatches between
supply and demand created noticeable gaps in market activity.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

New power companies ranking for May, Tokyo Gas tops the list
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 29)
o  METI and ANRE reported that the number of new power companies (shin denryoku) was
676, down 15 from the previous month. Of these, 482 have registered sales, down 13
from the previous month.
o  Tokyo Gas topped the list for the 14th consecutive month, but its sales dropped

significantly. Marubeni New Power Co overtook Osaka Gas to enter the top three.
o  The total sales volume of new power companies was 10.37 TWh, down 6.4% from the
previous year. Low voltage was down 16.9%; high voltage was up 3.0%; and extra high
voltage was up 5.5%.
o  Among the top high-voltage companies, Kyuden Mirai Energy (8th place) and CD Energy
Direct (9th place) switched places.
o  The top ten companies in the extra-high-voltage category remained unchanged.




JERA announces measures for winter electricity supply
(Company statement, Nov 27)
•  JERA plans measures to ensure electricity supply during the heavy-load winter, such as scheduled
maintenance for thermal power stations in warmer months.
•  JERA already enhanced supply with nine new operational units providing 6.53 GW of capacity; also
planning to launch the Goi Thermal Power Station Unit 3 in March 2025, and to resume operations
at the Taketoyo Thermal Power Station.

•  As far as LNG, JERA expects supply constraints to ease due to warm weather and high natural gas
stocks in Europe. There are risks from sudden cold snaps, production issues, or international
geopolitical changes.
•  CONTEXT: Under the Strategic Buffer LNG, JERA will secure one cargo of surplus LNG per month
from Dec 2024 to Feb 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: The Strategic Bugger was set up in December 2023 by METI, with JERA handling three cargoes

in the winter season. The govt already expressed plans to secure not only one cargo per month during the
winter season, but also for each month of the year. How much this improves Japanese LNG buyers’ conference
is yet to be seen, especially in the offpeak power demand seasons, but it does show the government’s
willingness to support marginal LNG purchases.

Mayor visits TEPCO and Tohoku Electric regarding NPP restarts
(Nikkei, Nov 25)
•  Hatanaka Toshiaki, mayor of Higashidori (Aomori Pref ), visited Tohoku Electric and TEPCO,
requesting the early restart of Tohoku Electric's Higashidori NPP Unit 1 (BWR, 1.1 GW), as well as

resuming construction on TEPCO's Higashidori NPP Unit 1 (ABWR, 1.39 GW).
•  CONTEXT: Higashidori NPP is unique in that it comprises two adjoining sites, one run by Tohoku
Electric and the other by TEPCO. Both have Toshiba reactors.
•  Mayor Hatanaka said closure of the NPPs negatively impacted the local economy.
•  Tohoku Electric president Higuchi Kojiro said Onagawa Unit 2's restart will benefit the local
community. TEPCO president Kobayakawa Tomoaki said work at Higashidori NPP Unit 1 must be
accelerated.

•  CONTEXT: The restart of Tohoku Electric's Higashidori Unit 1 has been under NRA review since
June 2014. Safety construction deadlines have been postponed six times. The revised completion
target is now set for Sept 2025. TEPCO's Higashidori Unit 1 still doesn’t have a clear timeline for
resumption. Construction began in 2011 but was stopped due to the 2011 Fukushima accident.

TEPCO submits revised pre-use inspection application for NPP

(Company statement, Nov 28)
•  TEPCO submitted to the NRA a revised pre-use inspection application for Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP
Unit 6.
•  Safety upgrades for Unit 6 are underway. Once the NRA approves, TEPCO plans to load fuel and
proceed with post-fuel-loading inspections.
•  CONTEXT: Unit 6 has been inactive since March 2012. TEPCO had hoped to restart both Unit 6
and Unit 7, having passed the NRA review in 2017. Approval for construction plans ahead of the

restart only came in September.
• TAKEAWAY: TEPCO said it plans to load nuclear fuel into Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP Unit 6 in June 2025.
December 2024 had previously been the target, but the restart date for Unit 6 remains undecided as Niigata
Pref has not yet agreed to the resumption, which is also delaying the restart of Unit 7. Discussions between the
company and the local govt is ongoing, but a restart does not seem around the corner. The national govt is
working with local authorities to address evacuation concerns. There is ongoing public unease about nuclear
plant safety in earthquake-prone regions like Niigata.

ANALYSIS

BY TETSUJI TOMITA
Can Japan Avoid a Power Shortage This Winter?

This past summer, Japan faced soaring electricity demand due to record heat,
straining the nation's power grid. However, disruptions were averted through
interregional electricity transfers and increased thermal plant output.

For winter 2024/25, METI expects a calmer situation. The official outlook by OCCTO,
which was made last month, sees capacity reserve margins exceeding 3% across all
regions, signaling stable supply. Consequently, METI will not call for energy
conservation measures.

Still, structural challenges – aging thermal plants and risks of equipment failures –
underscore lingering vulnerabilities in Japan’s power system. In addition to volatility in
the price and supply of LNG, sudden cold snaps and natural disasters have affected
the electricity system almost every year this decade. Only the occasional nuclear
reactor restart in the past two years has avoided technical glitches and delays.

To address these issues, METI is expanding LNG fuel purchasing support and
directing power companies to enforce strict safety protocols and secure additional
capacity. This will build on the measures that worked well last winter, 2023/24, when
electricity price and supply volatility remained moderate. The upcoming winter,
however, promises a different weather pattern.

Ensuring stable supply
OCCTO conducts rigorous evaluations of supply-demand conditions ahead of high-
demand periods: summer and winter peaks. Its October 2024 report assessed both
the supply-demand situation during summer 2024 and the outlook for winter. The
primary metric used is the reserve margin, which indicates the level of surplus capacity

relative to peak demand. A reserve margin of at least 3% is considered the minimum
for a stable power supply under extreme conditions, such as the coldest weather
recorded in the past decade.

For this winter, OCCTO has factored in potential risks, including unplanned outages
and fluctuations in renewable energy output. It has set the expected unplanned
outage rate at 2.6% across all regions, accounting for potential equipment failures.
Supply capacity estimates also exclude nuclear plants preparing for restarts, such as
Onagawa NPP Unit 2 (825 MW) in Tohoku and Shimane NPP Unit 2 (820 MW) in
Chugoku. Both are anticipated to begin commercial operation by January 2025, which
would bolster reserve margins in their respective regions.

Renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, have been evaluated using
historical performance data. Solar output is calculated as the average on peak
demand days over the past decade, while wind and hydroelectric power assessments
incorporate adjustments for natural variability. These refinements reflect the growing
importance of accurately predicting the performance of renewables, especially during
evening hours when solar output diminishes.

Supply capacity is analyzed based on plans submitted by all the EPCOs to
OCCTO, as well as additional data from 81 power generation companies
with more than 100 MW of capacity and 10 TSOs. These companies cover
a little more than 95% of the thermal generation capacity in all areas. In
addition, balancing capacity, activation command power sources, and
increased thermal power output capacity are added.


Comparison with past winters
The winter of FY2023 was unseasonably mild, resulting in lower-than-expected
electricity demand nationwide. Maximum demand was the lowest in five years, and
reserve margins remained robust, peaking at 14% and never falling below 11.4%.
Even on the coldest days, all regions maintained reserve margins above 9%, ensuring
stable supply.

In contrast, FY2022 experienced harsher winter conditions. Maximum demand in three
regions — Hokkaido, Tohoku, and Chubu — exceeded forecasts based on the coldest
days in the past decade. Nationwide reserve margins dipped to 10.5%, significantly
tighter than the previous year but still sufficient to avoid disruptions. Interregional
electricity transfers played a critical role in maintaining stability, particularly during
peak demand periods.

Unplanned outages have also varied significantly between years. In FY2023, outage
rates averaged 2.8%, rising to 3.1% during January's cold snap, partly due to
disruptions from the Noto Peninsula earthquake. By comparison, FY2022 saw lower
outage rates, averaging 1.9% annually and 1.8% during peak demand. These
fluctuations underscore the system's vulnerability to natural disasters and the
importance of robust contingency planning.

Risks and uncertainties
Despite the optimistic supply outlook, several risks could disrupt the balance. Extreme
weather events, such as cold waves or heavy snowfall, could drive up electricity
demand beyond current forecasts. The Japan Meteorological Agency predicts
average temperatures nationwide this winter. Colder-than-usual conditions are
expected in western Japan due to La Niña that typically strengthens pressure
patterns, bringing cold air southward, and increasing the likelihood of heavy snow and
lower temperatures in some regions.
Natural disasters remain another significant threat. Earthquakes, typhoons, and other
disasters can damage infrastructure and reduce supply capacity. While OCCTO
assumes a 2.6% unplanned outage rate in its calculations, recent events like the Noto
Peninsula earthquake have shown that actual rates at times can exceed this
assumption.

Renewable energy also introduces unique challenges due to the weather-reliant
output of solar and wind farms. While advances in forecasting and grid integration are
helping to mitigate these variables, the growing share of renewables in Japan's
energy mix requires continued innovation to ensure reliability and much more energy
storage than is available in the system today.

Measures to address tight supply-demand
In the event of a tight supply-demand balance, OCCTO has a tiered response system
to prevent shortages. If reserve margins fall below 3%, then ANRE will issue a Power
Supply-Demand Alert urging businesses and households to conserve electricity. For
reserve margins below 1%, rolling blackouts may be implemented, with affected areas
receiving at least two hours notice.

New measures introduced in FY2024 include daily updates on reserve margin
forecasts, published via the Cross-Regional Reserve Margin Web Publication System.
This real-time information aims to improve preparedness on both the supply and
demand sides, giving stakeholders more time to respond to potential shortages.

Efforts to strengthen Japan's power system are also underway through capacity
market reforms to enhance grid resilience. However, as covered in the Nov 11, 2024
issue of Japan NRG, these measures are a work in progress, with gaps in
implementation limiting their immediate impact.

Lessons from past reforms
Japan’s current electricity system has its roots in reforms initiated after the Great East
Japan Earthquake of 2011. That disaster exposed critical vulnerabilities, including
overreliance on large power plants and the lack of a unified response framework. As a
result, the government launched a three-phase reform process to fully liberalize the
electricity market, enhance grid connectivity, and ensure stable supply.

The reforms have made progress and are in their final stages. These include the legal
separation of power generation and transmission, the establishment of a capacity
market, and the introduction of power balancing mechanisms. But due to the
tightness of power supply-demand in recent years and its increased vulnerability to
disasters, global fuel markets, and greater forecast uncertainties, the earlier stages are
also being reviewed. The main goal today seems to be to introduce much more
flexibility into the power system – at all stages.

METI’s and OCCTO's forecasts for this winter suggest that Japan is well-prepared to
meet electricity demand under normal conditions. However, the system's
vulnerabilities to extreme weather, natural disasters, and renewable energy
fluctuations mean that risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Continued vigilance,
combined with ongoing reforms and technological innovation, will be essential to
ensuring a stable and resilient power supply in the years ahead.

ANALYSIS

BY MAGDALENA OSUMI
Offshore Wind Auctions Bet on Incremental Improvements to Boost Sector

As Japan braces for the outcome of Round 3 offshore wind tenders, industry insiders
are growing restless. Incremental tweaks to the auction framework over recent years
have sought to address pricing and timeline issues, but many worry that these
measured adjustments fall short of the urgency needed to meet the country’s
ambitious 2030 sector target.

So far, Japan has made only modest progress in offshore wind development, with a
total installed capacity of 153.5 MW by the end of 2023. This includes a mix of both
fixed-bottom and floating turbines, but just two wind farms account for the bulk of
that capacity.

A best-case scenario would see about 5.7 GW of offshore wind projects operating in
Japan by the end of FY2030 - based on the capacity awarded in the first three rounds
of tenders. But, this is almost half of the original 10 GW national target. More
importantly, it risks presenting Japan as a less attractive market for developers at a
time when others in Asia are embarking on ambitious offshore wind programs.

Preparations for Round 4 are adding to the doubts. The three sites expected to be
involved are currently at a preliminary stage of readiness, and require environmental
and foundational assessments before they can be opened to full-scale bidding. The
timeline for selecting operators has not yet been announced.
Despite efforts by METI and MLIT to refine regulatory frameworks and streamline the
bidding process, the uncertainties and supply chain frustrations are giving some
developers pause about Japan’s potential. Will the government be able to bring the
industry back on track?


Upcoming auction
The government is now preparing for Round 4 of the offshore wind auctions, focusing
on newly designated "preparation areas" that cover the following locations:
•  A site off the coast of Akita Prefecture (Oga City, Katagami City, and Akita
City),
•  Two sites off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture (eastern and western areas).

For Round 4, METI is revising criteria for evaluating offshore wind power project bids
to ensure faster development timelines and financial stability. The new standards that
come into effect from Round 4 include lead time for operations with a six-year
benchmark.

This is how it’s expected to work. Projects are evaluated on a 240-point scale, with 20
points allocated for the lead time to start operations. For instance, a standard
development period of six years will earn 18 points. Projects completing in five years
and six months will receive the full 20 points. Conversely, delays beyond six years will
incur penalties: a deduction of two points for each six-month delay. The six-year
benchmark reflects the average timeline proposed during Round 2.

To enhance focus on projects with robust financial and risk management plans, METI
will increase points for financial stability from 10 to 14, recognizing that significant
investments are required to finalize the projects with long-term forecasts. On average,
such investments are estimated at hundreds of billions of yen. The goal is to ensure
that projects are resilient against inflation and exchange rate fluctuations.

Another significant modification is the proposed reference price cap based on the
national average market price for wind power over the past three years, currently
estimated at ¥14/ kWh. Bidding price, set at an average capture price, would enable
bidders to secure maximum points. Prices higher than that would, on the other hand,
make bidders score lower with the point difference smaller than under the existing
rules.

In order to balance cost efficiency, ensure project feasibility while considering public
cost implications and encourage fair competition between "zero-premium" and "near-
zero premium" bidders, METI also proposes a scoring model for project feasibility
(out of 120 points) that uses an average 16-point gap observed in previous auctions.
This suggests that bidders at the near-zero premium level require a feasibility score of
104 points or higher to compete effectively.

The zero premium level represents a scenario where no additional financial support
(premium) is provided on top of the market price for electricity generated by the
offshore wind farm. Meanwhile, the near-zero premium level introduces a slightly
higher price point than the zero premium, allowing some flexibility for projects that
might face additional costs or challenges but are deemed competitive in the open
market.

The government is proposing a linear evaluation method for prices that fall between
the zero-premium and near-zero premium levels. For prices that exceed the near-zero
premium level, the evaluation may follow the maximum supply price cap set by the
guidelines under the act on promotion of renewables (e.g. ¥18/ kWh for monopile-
based projects in Round 3 and ¥29/ kWh for jacket-based projects in Round 2).


These changes seek to encourage earlier project completion and improve the financial
resilience of offshore wind projects.

Winning bids
In Japan, several offshore wind power projects have been approved in previous
tender rounds. For example, in Round 2, four projects were awarded:
1. Happo-Noshiro (Akita Prefecture): 356 MW capacity, won by a consortium led
by Japan Renewable Energy, Iberdrola Renewables Japan, and Tohoku
Electric Power. Operations are expected to begin in 2029.
2. Oga-Katagami-Akita (Akita Prefecture): 336 MW capacity, awarded to a group
led by JERA, J-Power, and Itochu.
3. Murakami-Tainai (Niigata Prefecture): 700 MW capacity, secured by a
consortium of Mitsui, RWE, and Osaka Gas, targeting operations by 2028.
4. Saikai-Enoshima (Nagasaki Prefecture): 424 MW capacity, awarded to
Sumitomo Corp and TEPCO Renewable Power, with operations planned for
2029.

Meanwhile, in Round 3, areas in the Sea of Japan (Aomori Prefecture) and Yuza
(Yamagata Prefecture) with capacities of 600 MW and 450 MW, respectively, are still in
the process of bidding. Results are expected in December 2024.

These projects continue to face challenges such as gaining community support,
particularly from local stakeholders, addressing supply chain limitations, and adhering
to tight construction and operational timelines. The interplay of regulatory revisions,
stakeholder negotiations, infrastructure constraints, and environmental requirements
has collectively slowed the progress of Japan's offshore wind projects.

Regulatory framework
Although the government has improved auction rules and introduced incentives, one
major issue is the lengthy and complex permitting process. Developers must navigate
multiple requirements, including obtaining approvals from various ministries and local
stakeholders.

These factors, along with technical and logistical challenges in developing floating
wind farms, mean that while Japan is making strides, it is likely to face delays in
reaching its national renewable energy goals.

Based on the lessons learned from the previous rounds, the government has
implemented several regulatory and procedural changes to address industry concerns
and to promote a fairer and more efficient bidding process. This is taken positively by
developers as it shows a willingness by the government to work with the sector to
improve its operation.


The speed of implementation, however, has been admittedly slow. After broad
industry concerns about monopolistic tendencies post Round 1, when Mitsubishi Corp
made a clean sweep of the three main projects on offer, METI introduced a cap of 1
GW on the total capacity any one consortium can win in a single tender. While this has
opened the auctions awards to more companies, it took a year of deliberations to
implement.

Additionally, the government has been revising evaluation criteria such as price factor
and timeline prioritization. Under the revised rules, all bids below a certain market
price threshold will now receive the same score, discouraging unrealistically low
pricing tactics. This ensures that projects are economically viable.

Higher scores have also been awarded for faster project delivery timelines, to
encourage operators to speed up project execution. The revised rules aim to make
the bidding process more attractive and transparent for international developers.
Round 2 finally saw two non-Japanese companies share the spoils: Iberdrola and
RWE.

Conclusion
The updates to the bidding process and the regulatory framework for Round 4
auctions are the most promising steps toward fostering competition, enhancing
financial stability, and ensuring faster project completion.

Industry insiders, however, are pushing the government to go beyond fine-tuning and
offer a bigger pie, especially since previous rule changes mean that the annual
expansion for a developer is already limited to 1 GW or less.

So far, the government’s response has been to tout the sector’s potential once wind
power generation moves further out to sea, into the Exclusive Economic Zone. That
will certainly require floating technology, much of which is still either at the R&D or
pilot stages.

Still, the message from state officials is that today’s gentle breeze could and should
eventually become a transformative gale. If and when it does, those who are toiling
today will be invited to enjoy the expanded power generation scale of tomorrow.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Battery storage
New South Wales approved the $1 billion Mount Piper battery energy storage system,
one of Australia’s biggest, which will store excess energy from the electricity grid
during non-peak periods. The project is being developed by EnergyAustralia and will
use the company’s existing electricity infrastructure. It will store up to 500 MW / 2,000
MW/h of power, enough for over 200,000 homes during high demand.

China / Coal
Coal power permits fell 83% in the first half of this year, with no new coal-based
steelmaking projects approved. Also, 52% of experts surveyed by the Centre for
Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland, and the International Society for Energy
Transition Studies in Australia, said they expect China's coal consumption to peak
next year.

China / Ocean energy
China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) plans to build an integrated facility that
will experiment with deep-sea renewable energy off the coast of Guangdong
province. CGN will lead a tech consortium to build an offshore “integrated energy
island,” which is regarded by scientists as one of the country’s 10 most challenging
engineering projects.

India / Green hydrogen
India is facing challenges in the rollout of green hydrogen. According to CareEdge
Ratings, the estimated levelised cost of green hydrogen, which includes both capital
expenditure and operational expenditure per unit of production, is currently around
1.75 times that of grey hydrogen and around 1.50 times that of brown hydrogen.

India / Solar power
India will add 22.4 GW of solar capacity in 2024, according to JMK Research. This
includes 17 GW from utility-scale projects, 4 GW from rooftop solar installations, and
1.4 GW from off-grid systems. In the wind sector, about 3.6 GW of new capacity is
projected this year. From January to September 2024, India added 13.2 GW of utility-
scale solar capacity, a 161% YoY increase.

India / Renewable energy
Tata Power and the Asian Development Bank inked a MoU to allocate $4.25 billion for
the company’s renewable energy projects in India. Financing for some projects will be
evaluated. These include a 966 MW solar wind hybrid project and pumped hydro
storage project, as well as others that focus on the energy transition, decarbonisation,
and battery storage.

LNG
The second term of Donald Trump will benefit LNG markets as he is expected to
accelerate the expansion of LNG infrastructure in the U.S. through deregulation and
fast-permitting. This will reverse the Biden administration’s regulatory pauses and
increase leases on federal land for gas production.

Philippines / Renewable energy
Meralco PowerGen Corp (MGen) said it plans to increase its power generation
portfolio through the addition of 1.5 GW of renewable energy.

Singapore / SMRs
Singapore should avoid becoming a test bed for small modular reactors (SMRs) in a
push to diversify its energy mix away from oil; the problem with SMRs is their high cost
and safety risks, according to energy analysts.

Thailand / Renewable energy
The Asian Development Bank and Gulf Renewable Energy inked an $820 million loan
to build 12 renewable energy projects; this includes eight ground-mounted solar PV
plants with contracted capacity of 393 MW and four ground-mounted solar PV plants
with battery energy storage that have contracted capacity of 256 MW and 396 MW/h
of energy storage.
