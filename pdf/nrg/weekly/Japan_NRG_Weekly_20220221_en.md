METI carbon pricing panel to delay proposal to March
(Japan NRG, Feb. 14)
•  METI’s director of environmental economy office said the government proposal on carbon pricing
will be delayed by a month. The expert panel interviewed companies in the energy, finance,
aviation sectors and municipal governments and concluded that more time is needed since
opinions were divided, including on:

o  Separating National Determined Contribution credits from voluntary credits
o  Will there be enough credit in supply and how to cope with shortages
o  Certifying quality of overseas voluntary credits that have yet to complete corresponding
adjustment process
o  Rules for labeling of services and products offset by voluntary credits
o  Exploring credits derived from new negative emission technologies and blue carbon
• TAKEAWAY: Companies with 2050 carbon neutrality goals have been challenged with limited renewable

supply, and recently, thin “carbon neutral” LNG supplies as demand has outstripped supply. Some fear
Japan’s credits supply may not satisfy demand and the country needs to “import” voluntary credits.
• There are new carbon absorption technologies, such as amine carbon absorbent developed by Kawasaki

Heavy Industries. Methodologies to establish their carbon offset capacity are needed.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI defines regulatory frameworks needed for carbon credit trades
(Japan NRG, Feb. 18)

o  METI defined the regulatory framework needed for trading voluntary carbon credits. The
main features are:
!  Trading platform such as an exchange
!  Transparency on offset credit pricing

!  Consumer-supplier matching mechanism, and quality assurance
o  The offset credit market structure is rapidly changing with the increase of intermediary
credit brokers, METI noted.
o  CONTEXT: METI is under fire as Japan falls behind the U.S. and Europe in establishing a
mechanism to monetize carbon neutrality innovations. Critics claim a lack of regulatory

framework has a lot to do with it.

Carbon credits awarded to Japan, Mongolia
(Japan NRG, Feb. 14)
•  A total of 35,419 tons of carbon offset credits were awarded to Japan and Mongolia for the launch
of a 12.7 MW solar power plant in Mongolia, the MoE said. The credits were issued under the Joint

Credit Mechanism. Japan’s share is 21,251 tons. The solar plant cuts 12,005 tons/year of carbon
emissions. It became operational in June 2018.

JERA to Conduct Competitive Bidding to Procure Ammonia Fuel
(Company Statement, Feb. 18)
•  JERA will hold an international bid for procurement of ammonia fuel, and sent a request for
proposals to more than 30 companies.

•  JERA is working on a project to demonstrate the use of ammonia fuel at the Hekinan Thermal
Power Station, aiming to switch 20% of the fuel at Unit 4 to ammonia by the late 2020s. Given the
steady progress of this demonstration project, JERA decided to consider ammonia fuel suppliers in
parallel, and to conduct an international competitive bid with the following main conditions:


Supply period Long-term contract from FY 2027 into the 2040s
Quantity    Up to 500,000 tons per year
Delivery mode FOB

• CO2 is either not generated during ammonia production or is captured and stored.
Other
• JERA has the opportunity to participate in production projects

• TAKEAWAY: The global ammonia market is about 200 million tons, but only about a tenth is available since
the rest is utilized for fertilizer production. In that context, the volumes sought by JERA are enormous. This is
possibly the largest such tender in the world.

• The ammonia would be a second fuel at JERA’s coal-fired power plants. JERA wants ammonia co-firing to be
at 20% within a decade.


Yamanashi prefecture to launch Japan’s first Power-to-Gas services
(Japan NRG, Feb. 14)
•  The Yamanashi prefectural government told METI’s Clean Energy Strategy Conference that the

country’s first power-to-gas (P-to-G) services will be launched this year. The prefecture, Toray and
TEPCO will form a joint venture, Yamanashi Hydrogen Company (YHC), that will provide the
services.
•  YHC will use solar power generated at the 10 MW Komekurayama power station to produce
hydrogen, which will be sold to hydrogen stations for FCVs and users of hydrogen-fueled boilers
and other equipment. The three parties have conducted trial P-to-G service runs since 2016.
•  CONTEXT: The Komekurayama power station generates 12 GWh/ year. Panasonic supplied solar

modules and hydrogen fuel cells, Toray the membrane electrolysis assembly system, JSW the
hydrogen storage tank, and Hitachi Zosen the electrolyzer.
• TAKEAWAY: YHC is likely to cater to Greater Tokyo’s demand as Yamanashi has only a handful of hydrogen
stations and less than 100 companies in the hydrogen business.


METI to coordinate government units for submarine power cable installation

(Japan NRG, Feb. 14)
•  In spring, METI plans to release a plan defining ANRE and OCCTO roles in pushing submarine
power cable installation to solve transmission bottlenecks. Proposed projects include connecting
Hokkaido and Honshu islands with submarine cables to transfer Hokkaido’s excess power to high
demand areas on Honshu Island.

| • JERA has the opportunity to participate in production projects |

•  The METI plan will show which units have the oversight for conducting geophysical surveys,
deciding cable routes, and more.
•  In 2022, OCCTO is expected to finalize the national masterplan for increasing power transmission
capacities both in trunk and local lines.
•  CONTEXT: There’s a political push to speed up an increase in capacity. PM Kishida in his Jan. 17

policy speech said power transmission infrastructure is essential for his Clean Energy Strategy.
• TAKEAWAY: This year, the grids will open their local network for non-firm connection with renewables
generators, aiming to increase overall power supply. Depending on how connections are managed, capacity
overflows could still result in renewable output curbs. The transmission capacity increase will lead to greater
copper demand. Grids account for less than 10% of Japan’s copper wire demand, which is even smaller than
automotive demand.

• The Electrical Wire Manufacturers Association sees domestic demand rising modestly on renewable
expansions to 670,000 tons in 2025, from the present 630,000 tons. If cable installation projects roll out
speedily, demand will outperform this forecast.



Japan to kick-start artificial photosynthesis R&D hoping it will cut hydrogen costs

(Asia Nikkei, Feb. 18)
•  Japan is preparing for a massive field test that will feature artificial photosynthesis, an emerging
technology that is expected to help cut the cost of producing hydrogen domestically among other
uses. The goal is to commercialize the tech by 2040.
•  The University of Tokyo, Toyota Motor and Mitsubishi Chemical are among entities involved in a
state-funded project to test the technology in 2030. NEDO will allocate ¥30 billion ($260 million)

over this decade to the project.
•  CONTEXT: Artificial photosynthesis mimics the natural process by using solar energy to generate
clean-burning hydrogen. The result can also be combined with CO2 to make industrial chemicals
that replace petroleum-based products.
•  Japan leads the way in artificial photosynthesis thanks to promising patents.




Japan Stock Exchange to research "Digitally Tracked Green Bonds"
(Company statement, Feb. 14)
•  Japan Exchange Group (JPX) is looking into raising funds via issuance of security tokens in the form
of a "Digitally Tracked Green Bond".
•  JPX aims to switch 100% of the Group’s electricity consumption to renewables and achieve carbon
neutrality by FY2024. JPX will invest in its own energy generation facilities, such as solar

panels and biomass facilities. It’s considering raising some of the investment by issuing a Digitally
Tracked Green Bond, which is the subject of the current research.
•  A "Digitally Tracked Green Bond" utilizes blockchain to improve transparency of data and
efficiency of data collection.

In global first, Chiyoda transports hydrogen as MCH by chemical tanker
(Kankyo Business, Feb. 15)
•  Chiyoda Corporation achieved a major milestone: the world's first marine transportation and
delivery of hydrogen in the form of methylcyclohexane (MCH) by chemical tanker.

•  The association is responsible for the production and supply of MCH from toluene and hydrogen in
Brunei Darussalam as part of a demonstration project promoted by ENEOS.
•  The MCH was produced in Brunei and transported to the port of Singapore, where it was stored in
existing outdoor storage tanks for several months before being loaded onto a chemical tanker at
the same port. The ship (DWT: 10,000-ton class mixed cargo) delivered the cargo to an ENEOS
refinery on Feb. 4.
•  Supply of MCH from Brunei to ENEOS by chemical tanker is set to continue.

•  The bonds will finance the development of low carbon fuels and the conversion of power plants to
natural gas.



Marubeni may invest in Indonesian CO2 recovery

(Nikkei, Feb. 17)
•  Marubeni signed an MoU with Indonesian state-owned energy company Pertamina concerning
carbon capture and storage.
•  The corporation will assess the feasibility of an initiative to recover biomass-derived CO2 (released
during pulp manufacture) for sequestration in depleted gas fields and under impermeable layers of
subterranean rock.
•  Marubeni will make a final investment decision by end of FY2022/23.

•  Marubeni might invest as much as $100 million in the project.



Toshiba succeeds in large-scale manufacturing of raw chemical materials using renewables
(Nikkei, Feb. 18)
•  Toshiba succeeded in developing a technology for mass production of carbon monoxide, a raw

material made from CO2.
•  For an incineration plant that produces about 200 tons of CO2 a day, carbon monoxide can be
processed in an area of about 2,000 square meters, equal to five basketball courts. Mixed with
hydrogen, carbon monoxide can be used to make synthetic methane, jet fuel, and other fuels.
•  This allows for CO2 emissions to be cut 80% compared to petroleum. With MoE support, the
company hopes to improve the system and put it to use in 2025.

Offshore wind rivals complain to the government over previous auction results
(Diamond, Feb. 18)
•  CONTEXT: In late December 2021, the government announced the winners for the first three
auctions for bottom-fixed offshore wind power projects in Japan. All three winning groups
consisted of Mitsubishi Corp and a unit of Chubu Electric. The lowest winning bid was ¥11.99/ kW.
•  Since the results were announced, rival offshore wind operators continue to lobby the government.

First and foremost, the three auctions were clearly decided on price. Rivals claim the process is
unfair because it favors companies with the most capital strength.
•  When the auction system was originally devised, some asked for a minimum price, but METI
balked at the idea.
•  A few industry players ask if it’s fair for a single company to submit multiple proposals. In some
cases, companies with capital ties bid in the same auction.
•  Some industry players have asked for winning bids to include a detailed breakdown of the pricing

structure. The government responded that this would harm the competitive position or other
legitimate interests of the winning entity.
•  METI minister Hagiuda said he’d like to see variety and will favor greater distribution in the future.

Chugoku Electric’s Shimane NPP Unit 2 edges closer to restart

(Asahi Shimbun, Feb. 15)
•  The mayor of Matsue City, where Chugoku Electric's Shimane Nuclear Power Plant is located, will
give consent to the restart of the No. 2 reactor. This is the first time a local government official has
approved turning the facility back on.
•  Shimane’s Unit 2 has been shut since Jan. 2012. In Sept. 2021, it passed the Nuclear Regulation
Authority's test for restarting operations. The operator then began to seek consent from Matsue
City and Shimane Prefecture.
•  The prefectural govt. will make a decision based on opinions of towns within a 30-km radius of the

plant. A decision is expected in late March at the earliest.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has only 7 reactors online after Kyushu Electric idled two of its units for maintenance. Even
a summer restart of the Shimane facility would not put the ratio of nuclear energy in Japan beyond where it
has been in recent years. However, this would be a major psychological step for the industry since it would
expand the number of utilities with nuclear stations online to four, the highest in close to a decade.

Domestic Hydrogen Opportunities Beckon
If Japan Can Tame its Excess Renewable Energy Volumes


If Japan were able to turn all excess renewable energy into hydrogen, it could fill the
tank of almost 3 million fuel cell vehicles. This is a calculation based on an idealized
scenario, of course, but it indicates just how much resource potential is wasted
without a way to store energy from variable renewable sources such as solar and wind.

Several pilot projects recent launched in the north and south of Japan seek a way to
put the wasted electricity to good use. Using excess renewable power to produce
hydrogen is a key decarbonization option for Japan because the process allows using
more wind and solar power generation, rather than curtailing output at off-peak times.

Such imbalances in the power grid will only increase as Japan looks to expand the
share of renewables to 36-38% by 2030, from about 18% in 2019. What’s more,
harnessing excess power to produce hydrogen requires the development of new
technologies, which could become a major export opportunity.


Pilots to the north and south
One of the larger projects is under way on the northernmost island of Hokkaido. Since
August, a consortium including Hokkaido Electric, Kyocera and Air Water has been
studying the feasibility of using power from offshore wind projects to make hydrogen,
which could then be moved by pipeline to land and utilized as fuel for power
generation, as well as via fuel cells for vehicles.

The project centers on a 100 MW offshore wind farm being built by Green Power
Investment in Ishikari Bay. The pilot is among several projects supported by the METI-
affiliated state research hub, NEDO1, to identify model cases for large-scale hydrogen
use in factories and ports.

The Hokkaido project taps into the potential of “green” hydrogen, which is produced
by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable power. The process
uses an electrolyzer that has zero CO2 emission, unlike “gray” hydrogen derived from
natural gas through the steam reforming process, or “blue” hydrogen in which the
carbon generated from steam reforming is captured and stored.

Meanwhile, last year in Kyushu’s Fukuoka Prefecture, companies including IHI Corp,
ENEOS, Fukuoka Oxygen and Kitakyushu Power started to test hydrogen production
using an electrolysis-based energy management system that simultaneously controls
multiple power sources, including those that burn waste.

Fukuoka’s Hibikinada area is home to about 160 MW of renewables, including solar
and wind. The hydrogen will be transported to pipelines in the Kitakyushu Hydrogen

Town project and local hydrogen fueling stations. The project is part of the MoE’s
plan to produce a model for how to manufacture low-cost hydrogen using existing
renewables sources.


Japan’s vision seeks take-up abroad
Japan was an early trailblazer in hydrogen technology, but government strategy has
been preoccupied with securing this fuel from abroad rather than its manufacture at
home. In part, the import-first approach was due to METI believing that domestic
hydrogen would be too expensive and volumes too small to stimulate interest.

Development began to pick up pace about 2014 when METI saw the need to build a
“hydrogen society”, envisioning the use of hydrogen as an energy source in its Basic
Energy Plan. In 2016, METI’s revised Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Roadmap specified that
power-to-gas (converting electricity from renewable energy sources into gas) was
expected to become a solution to balance the rising volume of electricity from
variable renewable sources. The following year, a national hydrogen strategy was put
together, ahead of other countries.

The latest version of the Basic Energy Plan supports the supply and use of locally
produced hydrogen to create models for a “hydrogen society.” While these
roadmaps acknowledge the potential for green hydrogen, most strategies focus on
hydrogen imports, such as liquified hydrogen produced via fossil fuel in Australia and
then shipped to Japan.

So far, Japan’s numerical targets for green hydrogen call for reducing the cost and
improving the efficiency of electrolyzers. Globally, as much as 88 GW (worth ¥4.4
trillion) of the equipment will be added every year through 2050. METI aims to reduce
the system cost of electrolyzers by making them larger and focusing on export before
expanding the market at home.

By 2030, Japan wants to reduce electrolyzer costs to ¥50,000/ kW, down from
¥200,000/ kW, and to improve water electrolysis efficiency to 4.3 kWh/ Nm3, from 5
kWh/ Nm3.

Japan expects to have 762 GWh of excess renewables output in the coming fiscal
year. As a percentage of total consumption, that's negligible. But turned into
hydrogen at the efficiency levels METI seeks, that’s over 117 million Nm3 of
hydrogen. Based on the fuel tank capacity of Toyota’s latest fuel-cell vehicle, the Mirai
II, this equals about 2.84 million full tanks.


Global competition
So far, more than 30 countries have either developed or are preparing hydrogen
strategies, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Some
EU countries plan to install electrolyzers to take advantage of cheap, abundant
offshore wind power. In Belgium, the Hyport project is being reviewed by Port of
Oostende, DEME Concessions and PMV, with a plan to install a 70 MW electrolyzer to
make hydrogen from excess offshore wind power by 2025.

Large-scale renewables and hydrogen projects are also under consideration. Shell,
Groningen Seaports, RWE, Equinor and Gasunie are studying the feasibility of the

NortH2 project to produce hydrogen using electricity from a 10 GW offshore wind
farm in the North Sea. They plan to store and transmit hydrogen to high-volume
consumers.

H2 Energy of Switzerland plans to build an offshore wind power-to-hydrogen plant in
Esbjerg, Denmark. Hydrogen will be used directly by fuel-cell trucks. The 1 GW plant,
slated to start in 2024, will produce enough hydrogen for 10,000 trucks.


Old challenges remain
The challenge for Japan has always been to find a source of cheap renewables
capacity. Now the push to develop large offshore wind power suggests that green
hydrogen may become an option, though it may take years.

Last year, the government chose winners for its first commercial offshore wind power
projects, to be operational between 2028 and 2030. In the meantime, the pilot
project in Hokkaido should provide evidence that making hydrogen from excess
power generation is viable.

Taking the timescale of the offshore wind
market into consideration, green hydrogen in
Japan and South Korea might only become
cheaper than blue hydrogen in 2030, says
BloombergNEF. That’s considerably slower
than China, which will see green hydrogen
undercut blue hydrogen in 2023, thanks to its
cheap electrolyzers, according to IRENA.

METI said that the geographic location of
electrolyzers will also impact cost. If
equipment is set up near the demand source,
such as factories, there’ll be no cost required
to transport hydrogen. However, if renewable
electricity is transmitted to an electrolyzer with
large capacity, hydrogen can be produced
cheaper, but it must be transported, possibly
raising overall cost.

One way to reduce cost is to bring users closer
to fuel production. Given the high cost of long-distance hydrogen transport, it makes
sense to relocate heavy energy users to areas with renewable sources. This would also
support the government’s goal of regional revitalization.

Moving fuel or electricity over distance always leads to loss. The answer could be to
double-down on what the government often says but rarely achieves: make local
energy for local use. After all, with just a few thousand Toyota Mirai fuel cell vehicles
sold in Japan to date, filling these tanks should not be the primary objective of the
country’s hydrogen strategy.

Hydrogen to Drive Further Emission Cuts at Japan’s Auto Sector
As Companies Prepare for Methanation Rollout


CO2 emissions in Japan’s automotive industry, the nation’s top economic sector,
have dropped for a fourth straight year. Now, to achieve greater cuts, some
companies are looking into an overhaul of their manufacturing processes with the
introduction of hydrogen fueled systems.

Hydrogen is expected to help Japanese manufacturers in a number of ways,
including through its role in the methanation process. Several firms are due to
announce new methanation applications later this year.

Still, doubts remain among industry insiders about how best to deploy hydrogen,
while the endless debate over electrification vs hydrogen shows no sign of
abating.

Earlier this month, representatives of key auto industry bodies met with the
government to discuss progress in decarbonization in 2020 and the latest initiative.
The good news was that both large car manufacturers and the even bigger auto parts
industrial complex have seen positive momentum.

Below is a summary of the talks and background details.


Toyota Group initiatives
Toyota Motor Corporation is famous for its backing of hydrogen, but this support is

usually painted as a one-dimensional strategy to sell more fuel cell-vehicles (FCVs).
The automaker was the first to mass produce an FCV with the release of the Mirai
sedan in 2014, and followed it up with the much-improved Mirai II in late 2020.

The Toyota Group, however, has pursued a much broader hydrogen-focused
technological shift in which FCVs act as one of the stimuli for decarbonization. The
group also leads an initiative to develop a zero-emissions hydrogen burner, which
was developed together with Chugai Ro Co., and a solid oxide fuel cell-micro gas
turbine (SOFC MGT), which would serve as the basis of a hydrogen power plant.

Toyota Industries, a components supplier for the Mirai, hopes to introduce
hydrogen-powered forklifts at its Takahama plant in the coming months. The forklifts
will run on green hydrogen produced onsite through electrolysis powered by rooftop
solar. The shift to zero-emissions forklifts will have a sizable impact: a unit that runs
on fossil fuels averages 3.23 tons of CO2/ year, according to Japan Industry Vehicle
Association (JIVA).

The move to hydrogen-powered forklifts is not universally popular, however, even
within the Toyota universe. Some engineers believe using solar panels to power

19

electric forklifts would be more efficient. Others say FCVs are still best deployed in
confined environments. With the current lack of hydrogen fueling infrastructure, “in-
house” use of hydrogen at a factory complex is the most realistic, a metals supplier
for the Mirai told Japan NRG.

National data shows that the auto industry’s concern is real. Japan’s 2017 Basic
Hydrogen Strategy forecasts 500 hydrogen forklift units deployed nationwide by
March 2021. In fact, there were 330 units in operation. Momentum will accelerate,
however, according to industry discussions with the government, driven by greater
focus on the climate and Japan’s declining population.

As labor shortages become more acute, demand for forklifts will rise, says a JIVA
representative. Replacing older units is also a chance to shift the technology to fuel
cell or electric machines. Japan should deploy 10,000 fuel-cell powered forklifts by
2030, according to METI’s targets.

Another hydrogen initiative pushed by the Toyota Group is methanation: a
process through which carbon and hydrogen are converted into methane and
water.

In April, Toyota Industries plans to launch a methanation facility at its plant. It will
produce synthetic methane combining carbon generated during the regular
manufacturing process with hydrogen. The resultant methane will be used to run plant
equipment. Initial energy output will be at around 5 kWh.


Interest in methanation as an effective way to deploy carbon, creating clean heat
with high calorific value, is spreading to Toyota Group’s lower tier component
suppliers that work with aluminum. Heat comprises 70% of the Scope II emissions of
auto component production, according to Japan Auto Parts Industry Association
(JAPIA). A cogeneration system that uses methanation to recycle carbon should
significantly cut end-point emissions.

While JAPIA declined to elaborate further, Japan NRG believes Aisin, a leading
aluminum components maker and a member of the Methanation Council, is likely to
start deploying methanation soon. Another is Denso, which has already built a pilot
methanation system at its Yasugi plant.


2020 automotive emissions review
In 2020, the 14 Japanese automakers released 5.2 million tons of CO2 at their
domestic plants, R&D centers and offices, down from 5.82 million tons a year earlier,
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) data show.

This decline was partly due to a drop in domestic vehicle output to 8 million units,
from 9.5 million units in the same period the previous year. The rest was due to
process improvements in gas-fired power generation, the blocking of air and steam
leaks, and moving output to off-peak hours. Sector-wide initiatives included
introduction of high-performance boilers, switching motors into inverters, and
changing lighting systems to LEDs. Their 2020 renewable power consumption was a
little over 400 GWh, almost flat from 2019.

The 140 auto parts makers emitted 5.82 million tons of CO2 in 2020, down from
6.27 million tons a year earlier, also due to production declines. CO2 declines,

however, were less than the sales drop, suggesting poor energy efficiency, JAPIA
said.

Looking at the pre-Covid figures, both the automakers and auto parts companies
are close to meeting their 2030 emissions targets: 6.16 million tons for JAMA and
5.62 million tons for JAPIA.














Future targets
In the context of the nation’s total GHG emissions, the automotive sector accounted
for just 1% of the total in 2020, far below its GDP contribution. Still, the government is
pushing the auto firms to go beyond their current process improvements and FCV/EV
rollout. Production facilities need to review the energy consumption of the main
equipment and consider reconstruction or overhaul, a government working group told
industry representatives.

The future role of hydrogen in decarbonization also faces uncertainty. While the
Toyota Group has been a pioneer in hydrogen R&D, and most recently in
promoting methanation, the automaker has also joined the global race to scale up
EV manufacturing; it significantly increased output targets and resources for battery-
powered cars.

In terms of meeting consumer demand, that seems logical. Whether Toyota will
continue to promote the broader hydrogen economy without FCVs at the center of
auto sales is now a source of much speculation.

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Algeria/ LNG
China's Sinopec inked a $178 million deal with Algeria to build a massive 150,000 m3
LNG storage tank at the country's gas export terminal of Skikda. Algeria has the
world's 10th largest natural gas reserves, it's the world’s sixth-largest gas exporter,
and exports nearly 60% of its output.

Australia/ Solar power
In 2021, 5.2 GW of solar power capacity was installed, giving Australia total solar
capacity of 26.9 GW, which is more per capita than any other country. Small- and
large-scale solar projects provide 13% of Australia’s total electricity supply.

Brazil/ Solar power
About $320 million will be invested to build a 532 MW solar project in the state of Rio
Grande do Norte. Norway’s Scatec, Equinor and Hydro will lead development. The
project will be operational in late 2023. Scatec sees Latin America as a key growth
market and has a project pipeline of 2.1 GW in the region.

Chile/ Solar power
Solek Group will build and sell up to 200 MW of solar capacity to BlackRock’s Global
Renewable Power Fund III. The PV portfolio consists of 28 solar projects. Chile will
hold a power auction to contract 5,250 GWh annually for 15 years.

Financing/ Coal power
Despite net-zero pledges, more than $1.5 trillion was invested in the coal industry
from Jan. 2019 to Nov. 2021. Banks financed 1,032 coal industry firms, said German
environmental group Urgewald. Banks from six countries – China, U.S., Japan, India,
UK and Canada – accounted for 86% of total coal financing.

France/ Offshore wind power
About 50 offshore wind farms totaling 40 GW of capacity will be built by 2050. France
will invest €1 billion to develop new technologies such as floating wind. By 2028,
France will hold tenders for about 8.75 GW of offshore wind capacity.

India/ LNG
Petronet LNG will invest $5.3 billion to expand domestically and buy stakes in
international gas projects. Among these is the Dahej LNG import terminal in Gujarat,
which will have an annual capacity of 22.5 million tons once its expansion is
completed.

Netherlands/ Green hydrogen
RWE will develop a green hydrogen demonstration project in the North Sea. The
“H2opZee” offshore project has an electrolyser capacity of 300 to 500 MW that can
convert offshore wind power to hydrogen. Overall, RWE plans to build 2 GW of
electrolyser capacity by 2030.

| project will be operational in late 2023. Scatec sees Latin America as a key growth |
| market and has a project pipeline of 2.1 GW in the region. |
|  |
| Chile/ Solar power |
| Solek Group will build and sell up to 200 MW of solar capacity to BlackRock’s Global |
| Renewable Power Fund III. The PV portfolio consists of 28 solar projects. Chile will |
| hold a power auction to contract 5,250 GWh annually for 15 years. |
|  |
| Financing/ Coal power |
| Despite net-zero pledges, more than $1.5 trillion was invested in the coal industry |
| from Jan. 2019 to Nov. 2021. Banks financed 1,032 coal industry firms, said German |
| environmental group Urgewald. Banks from six countries – China, U.S., Japan, India, |
| UK and Canada – accounted for 86% of total coal financing. |
|  |
| France/ Offshore wind power |
| About 50 offshore wind farms totaling 40 GW of capacity will be built by 2050. France |
| will invest €1 billion to develop new technologies such as floating wind. By 2028, |
| France will hold tenders for about 8.75 GW of offshore wind capacity. |
|  |
| India/ LNG |
| Petronet LNG will invest $5.3 billion to expand domestically and buy stakes in |
| international gas projects. Among these is the Dahej LNG import terminal in Gujarat, |
| which will have an annual capacity of 22.5 million tons once its expansion is |
| completed. |
|  |
| Netherlands/ Green hydrogen |
| RWE will develop a green hydrogen demonstration project in the North Sea. The |
| “H2opZee” offshore project has an electrolyser capacity of 300 to 500 MW that can |
| convert offshore wind power to hydrogen. Overall, RWE plans to build 2 GW of |
| electrolyser capacity by 2030. |
|  |

Philippines/ Renewables
This year, Aboitiz Power Corp. will build 600 MW of renewable energy capacity. By
2030, the company will spend $3.7 billion to grow its renewables capacity to 4.6 GW,
which would be 50% of its total generation portfolio of 9.2 GW.

Saudi Arabia/ Energy transition
Assets worth $80 billion were transferred to the country’s sovereign wealth fund that
will invest in green projects. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants the
investment fund to have $1 trillion in assets by the 2026.

U.S./ Coal power
By 2030, Duke Energy will slash coal-fired capacity to less than 5% of total generation,
with a complete exit by 2035. Duke owns about 16 GW of coal-fired capacity, 25% of
its overall owned portfolio. Duke aims for 50% emissions reductions by 2030 and net-
zero by 2050.
