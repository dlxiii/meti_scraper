METI energy panel lists govt. measures in response to power price spike last winter

(Japan NRG, June 15)
•  The Energy Research Council, which reports to METI, published an interim report on last winter’s
situation that led to power shortages and a price spike. It listed several proposed government
measures to avoid a similar situation this winter and beyond.
•  First, the govt. will expand its power supply and demand forecasting, both in terms of scope and
frequency. The analysis will center on a kw and kWh basis, and there’ll be periodical reviews in
addition to the main study two months before peak season.
•  The govt. plans new guidelines on fuel procurement during power shortages.

•  New standards are planned in the wholesale power market to reduce the impact of large players
on trading. To increase the liquidity of the wholesale market, the govt. will also raise the frequency
of baseload auctions.
•  Also, operators will be encouraged to utilize various futures hedging mechanisms.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI sets price caps on power imbalancing rates for normal and extreme conditions
(Japan NRG, June 16)
o  METI revised relevant ordinances to set a price cap of ¥80/ kWh and ¥200/ kWh on
imbalancing rates in the wholesale electricity market.
o  The lower cap will apply in normal market conditions and the higher one will kick in
during an acute power shortage. The latter will be determined as such when the 10 major

regional utilities say they have less than 3% spare capacity to meet demand.
o  CONTEXT: METI used such caps on imbalancing rates to put a ceiling on electricity
prices during the massive spike in January.
• TAKEAWAY: The spike in power prices that occurred in January was closely scrutinized by the government.
Measures to counter some of what was identified as the causes of the spike are now being rolled out.




Biomass operator plans to buy Japan coal plants and convert them to clean fuels
(Nikkei, June 18)
•  eRex, an operator of biomass power plants in Japan, plans to buy coal-fired generation facilities
and convert them to a cleaner fuel.

•  The Japanese company is in talked with owners of coal power plants in Japan’s Kanto, Hokuriku
and Shikoku regions. At first, eRex may buy about four plants with a 150 MW to 500 MW capacity
each.
•  eRex then plans to install equipment such as biomass storage, crushers and more to convert the
plants to burn biomass.
•  Initially, coal would be mixed in with biomass, which would account for 30% of the total fuel mix. It

is hoped that by 2025 the plants could switch entirely to biomass.
•  The cost of 1 kWh at a purchased coal-fired facility that’s burning 30% biomass is estimated to be
less than ¥10, which is cheaper than burning coal only.

•  eRex uses sorghum-based biofuel and grows the grain in Vietnam and the Philippines.
•  CONTEXT: Sorghum is a cereal grain in the grass family that can be harvested several times a year.
• TAKEAWAY: eRex is also the company that in April said it would seek to build Japan’s first hydrogen-fired
power plant, which is slated to come online in March 2022. This and the coal plant conversions could make the
hitherto little-known company a major player in Japan’s power industry in the coming years.





Environment Minister slams METI for allegedly delaying Basic Energy Plan
(TBS News, June 15)
•  In a warning to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Environment Minister Koizumi
sharply criticized reports that proposed amendments to Japan’s basic energy plan could be
postponed until after the election because they are unpalatable to voters.
•  Koizumi said he was sure METI would not dream of “sabotaging” the amendments as some
reports allege.
•  Koizumi said the amendments should be finalized by the COP26 UN climate change conference
in November.
• TAKEAWAY: In last week’s edition we detailed the multiple political factors that now seem certain to delay the
presentation of Japan’s latest Basic Energy Plan, a roadmap for how the government wants the energy and
electricity industries to look by 2030 and beyond. The Ministry of Environment is clearly upset by the delays
since they cause complications with Japan’s COP26 message and also potentially weaken its influence on the

final report. On the back of PM Suga’s ambitious declaration of a 46% cut to national emissions by FY2030, the
Ministry of Environment has managed to lobby for a higher share of renewables in Japan’s future power mix.
However, that position does not look solid. Lots of other energy sources would like to make their case.
Minister Koizumi’s comments suggest that a growing role for renewables is not a widely held opinion in
government, bureaucracy and business circles, and should COP26 pass other political forces may have the
upper hand.




Environment Ministry announces overseas decarbonization goal via carbon credits
(Kankyo Business, June 16)
•  The Ministry of the Environment announced a private/public sector initiative to leverage the “joint
crediting mechanism” and overseas projects to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 100 million
metric tons by 2030.
•  Environment Minister Koizumi announced the new target in the context of decarbonization

initiatives in the Indo-Pacific aimed at supporting the transition to a more sustainable society.
•  He added that the new target can’t be achieved only by continuing existing programs, and that the
¥1 trillion investment will spur growth in the global decarbonization market, as well as Japan’s
decarbonization technology.



Local governments hopeful after MoE offer of grants for renewable energy development

•  At a June 9 meeting hosted at the Prime Minister’s residence, the government unveiled its regional
decarbonization roadmap
•  The roadmap stipulates that at least 100 regions should achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2030
and initiatives to promote renewable energy have significant potential to revitalize Japan’s regions.
•  Environment Minister Koizumi said he’s thinking about grants scheme for regions that invest in
renewable energy.
•  One day earlier, Koizumi said while local bodies receive grants for hosting nuclear power plants, the

same is not true of renewable plants.
•  Previously, Hagiwara Seiji, the mayor of Mimasaka (Okayama), which has more large-scale solar
farms than anywhere in Japan, had unsuccessfully called for grants to nuclear power plants to also
be extended to solar farms.
•  While the minister has yet to provide details, it’s likely that a portion of profits from solar farms will
be reinvested in communities hosting them.

• TAKEAWAY: Ever since a wind power developer in northern Japan suggested paying local fishermen 1% of the
revenue from the offshore project to compensate for lost fishing grounds the idea became almost common
practice. Solar needs to offer a similar compensation to the local communities that to date have seen little
practical reason to support the green power push. As one government advisor said at a policy meeting last
year: localities need to have something at stake and it can’t be the chance to help save the planet.



Japan vows to stop financing overseas coal power plants without offsets
(Nikkei, June 15)
•  PM Suga said during the G7 Summit in the U.K. that Japan will withdraw from financing overseas
coal-fired power plant projects led by domestic companies if they do not have offsets.
•  The exit could take place as soon as this year and will bring Japan in line with the rest of the G7.
•  The move puts more pressure on China to follow.

•  A METI official suggested Japan will continue to support ongoing projects that are already under
contract.
•  The G7 communique makes exceptions for coal-fired power plants that deploy carbon capture
technology to reduce emissions.



ENEOS ties up with Chiyoda Corp to develop cheaper green hydrogen technology
(Nikkei, June 20)
•  The two companies will work on R&D to create a cheaper electrolysis process that can reduce the
hydrogen price to ¥330 per kg, which is one third of the current price at which the gas is

distributed in Japan.
•  This price level is also the goal the government has set for the country by 2030.
•  ENEOS, a major oil refiner, and Chiyoda, an engineering firm, plan to build a plant possibly in
Australia by 2030 due to the country’s cheaper land and renewable energy costs.
•  The Japanese company’s approach focuses on electrolyzing water and toluene at the same time to
directly produce a liquid compound called methylcyclohexane (MCH). The latter can be easily

transported and converted to hydrogen. This would be a simplification of the current production
process, cutting capital investments by half.

facility with 1,000 units to establish mass scale.




Hino to start sales of small EV bus from spring 2022
(New Energy Business News, June 17)
•  Hino Motors will release the small electric bus, "Hino Poncho Z EV”, in the spring of 2022. It
accommodates 30 passengers and is equipped with a 105kWh lithium-ion battery that is
compatible with standard quick chargers.
•  The vehicle will be handled by a JV between Hino Motors and Kansai Electric.
•  "Hino Poncho" was released in 2002 and is a diesel bus widely adopted nationwide to service

small communities.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Honda to discontinue fuel cell car Clarity due to weak demand
(Nikkei, June 16)
o  A high price tag and a lack of fueling stations undercut demand for a vehicle Honda
earlier saw as a key pillar of its decarbonization strategy.

o  Honda only sold about 1,900 units worldwide.
• TAKEAWAY: Honda is not ending its forays into fuel cell vehicles, and Hino’s EV bus is only used for shorter,
community routes. Still, there are more positive news of late for EVs than their fuel cell cousins. Toyota remains
Japan’s biggest driving force for a fuel cell transport future. Should it waver, the entire FCV rollout may need
to be re-considered.



Renewable energy task force outlines guiding principles
(Mega Solar Business News, June 16)
•  On June 3, the 10th session of the Cabinet Office task force for the review of regulations governing

renewable energy was convened.
•  The task force stipulated the prioritization of renewable energy, flexibility, and the establishment of
an environment for fair competition.
•  The task force called for more state resources in the renewable energy sector, and the reform of
renewables-friendly energy systems and markets.
•  The group highlighted deficiencies in Japan’s power grid, which it said are an unfair obstacle to
operators that did not exist in regions like Europe. The group hopes to abolish the requirement for

on-site power storage in Hokkaido, opening up local groups to more generators. It also wants to
review grid connections from operators currently on a non-firm connection based on economic
merit rather than a first-come first-served basis.



Toho Gas joins Japan group in Australian carbon capture and storage project

(Denki Shimbun, June 16)
•  Toho Gas will participate in Australia's offshore CO2 capture and storage hub project "Deep C
Store". A joint study contract was signed with the developer, Transborders Energy.

•  Transborders Energy already signed an MoU last December with Kyushu Electric, Tokyo Gas,
Osaka Gas and others to explore the potential development. Now, Toho Gas and JX Nippon Oil &

Gas have joined.



JERA wins NEDO funds to study CO2 capture and methanation in the U.S.
(Company statement, June 16)
•  JERA won a grant to do a feasibility study on CO2 capture and methanation in the U.S. from state-

backed New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The study
period is June 2021 to February 2022.
•  JERA aims to produce CO2-free methane gas on a commercial basis and will use the tests in the
U.S. to investigate the business potential of this process.
•  The utility plans to generate hydrogen needed for the methanation reaction using locally sourced
low-cost renewable energy and will employ CO2 captured from U.S. thermal power plants and
refineries.
•  JERA said it believes methanation can utilize existing LNG-related infrastructure to cut the cost of

decarbonization in Japan and elsewhere.
•  CONTEXT: JERA has U.S. investments across multiple fields, including renewables, hydrogen, gas-
fired power generation and LNG production.
• TAKEAWAY: Please see the June 7 edition of Japan NRG Weekly for a deep dive on what is happening with
the development of methanation in Japan and why it’s vital for the country. In short, it is seen as a main way to
decarbonize the nation’s gas industry.




Toppan and ENEOS aim to commercialize paper-to-bioethanol process

(Kankyo Business, June 16)
•  Toppan and ENEOS agreed to establish a new process for manufacturing bioethanol from paper
and cardboard waste.
•  The two companies want a commercially viable process by 2027.
•  Even forms of paper currently deemed unsuitable for recycling, such as waterproof paper and
carbon paper, will be converted to ethanol.
•  The process will enable the continuous addition of raw materials.
•  By utilizing paper waste, rather than potential food sources like sugarcane, the new process aims

to avoid competition with food sources.

Toda consortium selected to build Japan’s first commercial-scale floating offshore wind farm
(Kankyo Business, June 14)
•  METI selected a consortium led by Toda Corporation to construct a 2,700-ha wind farm off the
coast of Nagasaki.
•  The 16 MW project will comprise of eight turbines.

•  The other companies in the consortium are ENEOS, Osaka Gas, KEPCO, INPEX, and Chubu
Electric.
• TAKEAWAY: This result is the first from the four major sea area tenders for offshore wind development. The
bidding period closed at the end of May and results from the other areas in northern Japan and off the coast
of Chiba are expected to take some time. Those three are for fixed bottom offshore wind projects. The
Nagasaki tender is the only one for floating wind technology, which is expected to play the dominant role in

Japan in the future but which at this stage is still being tested and refined. As such, it is not surprising that only
one bidder materialized and that it was in fact a very wide consortium of companies that would not naturally
work all together. The Nagasaki project is best seen as an advanced R&D project and not a fully commercial
development. However, it does give a sense of which players in Japan are interested in working with floating
projects in the future.

• We plan to publish a more in-depth take on the offshore wind tenders in an upcoming issue of the Weekly.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hitachi ABB Power Grid starts providing transformer products for floating offshore wind

(Morning Star; June 7, 2021)
o  Hitachi ABB Power Grid will start offering transformer products for floating offshore wind
turbines.
o  The product line is designed to withstand the harsh environment of floating offshore
wind turbines.
o  Hitachi ABB Power Grid will support the spread of floating offshore wind power plants

and the efficient use of wind-powered energy through these products.

METI asks TEPCO to delay maintenance of thermal plants to meet winter peaks
(Asahi Shimbun, June 16)
•  METI published measures to help avoid power shortages this winter, especially within the zone
dominated by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). The ministry asked the utility to delay

some maintenance works of thermal power plants in order to have enough capacity online during
peak periods.
•  TEPCO reported earlier this year that its reserve capacity margin is expected to reach minus 0.2%
in January next year and minus 0.3% in February.
•  Japan’s power regulations call for a minimum of 3% reserve capacity, which in TEPCO’s case would
be about 1.5 GW, equivalent to 1.5 nuclear reactors.
•  METI’s suggestions will free up an additional 1 GW or capacity for the first two months of next

calendar year. A further 500 MW is expected to be secured by restarting suspended thermal power
facilities.
•  A final decision on which power stations will be utilized will be made by TEPCO Power Grid, which
handles local power transmission and distribution.
•  METI expects that JERA’s Anegasaki Thermal Power Station in Chiba would be part of the
restarted capacity. It was idled in April this year.
•  The cost of restarting capacity will be added to the transmission line usage fee (the consignment

fee) in the TEPCO jurisdiction and will be collected from power retailers. In essence, it will be
borne by the consumer.
•  Power shortages may occur elsewhere in Japan. Six of the major regional utilities, including Chubu,
Kansai, and Kyushu EPCos, are expected to have a reserve margin of only 3% in February next
year.
• TAKEAWAY: A recent report by the systems operator OCCTO suggests the above measures and a few restarts

of nuclear reactors are starting to ease government and industry concerns about possible shortages this
summer.



Shikoku Electric plans to restart Ikata No. 3 nuclear reactor in October

(NHK, June 16)
•  Shikoku Electric plans to restart its Ikata NPP’s Unit 3 on Oct. 12, with commercial operations due
to begin by Nov. 12.
•  The facility aims to complete upgrades to its anti-terrorism safety measures by Oct. 5, which would
be the last barrier to its restart.
•  The reactor has been idled since December 2019 after a Hiroshima city court ruling that prohibited
operations and sided with an anti-nuclear citizens group. A high court in the same city reversed the
earlier decision in March 2021.

•  According to the utility, the reactor would be hooked up to the grid on Oct. 17.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

o  Comments by the Nuclear Regulation Authority chair Fuketa, made a meeting on June
16, suggest that the watchdog is edging closer to authorizing the restart of Chugoku
Electric’s Shimane NPP Unit 2.
o  The facility is being examined as to whether it meets new regulatory standards and a
decision could be made as soon as June 23, the chairman said.

• TAKEAWAY: As Japan NRG has previously mentioned, the nuclear industry is benefitting from several factors
in recent months and trying to build momentum for more of the existing reactors to restart. The 10-year
Fukushima anniversary has passed; PM Suga has set very ambitious decarbonization targets for 2030 and 2050;
and many industrial players are unhappy at rising electricity prices, which they often attribute to a rising
percentage of renewable energy in the mix. Overall, the government’s position on nuclear is still very divided.
Some key ministers are starkly against a return to pre-Fukushima reliance on nuclear power. However, for now

at least, the pro-nuclear lobby has more momentum with ex-PM Abe and other top figures in the ruling party
announcing their backing for nuclear power.



Power panel proposes floor and cap prices for non-fossil certificates

(Japan NRG, June 14)
•  A sub-committee of Energy Research Council proposed a price floor of ¥0.6/ kWh and a cap of
¥1.3/ kWh for non-fossil-fuel certificates. The levels were decided based on past data and surveys.
•  Power retailers who are mandated to offer green power to consumers traded the certificates in a
range of ¥0.9 to ¥1.0.
•  The sub-committee also proposed a 6% threshold on an operator’s share of externally sourced

certificates. This 6% equates to 75.6 billion kWh.
•  To enforce compliance in the certificate trading space, the panel suggested monitoring quarterly
auctions and holding a separate annual review. It will discuss identifying dominant players to be
subject to monitoring, which will be expanded in time.



Osaka offers discounts to buyers of solar panels discounts if they also procure batteries

(Kankyo Business, June 15)
•  The Osaka prefectural government and Osaka City are offering operators of solar panels and
storage batteries discounts of up to 30% by participating in the Osaka Smart Energy Center’s
syndicated procurement plan.
•  Those buying panels receive a discount of 30% off market prices, those buying batteries receive a
discount of 22%, and purchasers of both panels and batteries receive a discount of 23%.
•  The plan’s goal is to support every step of the installation process.

•  The investment in the Monsoon wind power project was not disclosed but is expected to be in the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
•  Mitsubishi’s Diamond Generating Asia subsidiary will make a joint investment in the project with
two Thai firms. These are a unit of Impact Electron Siam and a unit of BCPG Public Company Ltd.
Mitsubishi’s stake in the project will be around 20%.

•  Construction of the Monsoon project is due to start in 2024. The electricity will be sold to
Vietnam’s state-run power utility under a 25-year contract.
•  Mitsubishi anticipates the market for cross-border power sales in Southeast Asia will develop
further.



Toho Gas starts to offer solar power facilities on-site maintenance services

(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, June 16)
•  Toho Gas has started a third-party servicing business based on solar power generation. The gas
utility based in Nagoya will install and maintain the solar equipment on the customer's premises.
•  Corporate clients will be able to have solar panels installed on-site at no initial cost, and then
consume the electricity generated. Toho Gas would receive a service maintenance fee.
•  The gas company already found its first customer for the service, adding 13 KW of solar on-site

power at a Meiko Construction office in Nagoya.
• TAKEAWAY: It’s interesting to see major power and gas companies in Japan start to offer third-party services
for renewables. While they have so far shied away from installing significant solar capacity themselves, the fact
that they are involved and earning money solar operates is a boon for the renewables industry. The EPCOs
and gas companies now have a tangible reason to help renewables players seek better terms and business
expansion.




JV between Tokyo Gas and Octopus Energy to starts operating this fall
(Denki Shimbun, June 14)
•  The JV called TG Octopus Energy opened its Tokyo office on June 7. About 20 staff are at the

office, with some expected to join from the U.K.
•  The two partners aim to develop a variety of electricity price plans using Octopus’ IT platform, with
customer-facing service due as early as October.
•  The policy is to launch one simple price menu and gradually expand with a focus on retailing
electricity from renewable sources.
•  Tokyo Gas hopes to bring to Japan several products and approaches that Octopus successfully

applied in the UK and other European countries.
•  This is the UK firm’s first entrance into the Asia market.
•  CONTEXT: Since market liberalization in 2016, Tokyo Gas has grown to be the largest retailer of
electricity in Japan after the incumbent power utilities (the EPCos). The gas firm aims to have 3.8
million power customers by FY2022. It currently has about 2.7 million signed contracts.

Parliament enacts law limiting foreign ownership of land near nuclear power plants
(Parliamentary notice, June 17)
•  Japan’s upper house, the House of Councilors, enacted on June 16 a new law limiting foreign
ownership of property close to sensitive facilities, including nuclear power plants, defense facilities

and remote islands. The prime minister will have direct oversight on the law.
•  Areas one kilometers away from such facilities will be defined as sensitive zones, and there’ll be a
second category of sensitive zones.
•  The PM will also set up a new advisory council to review enforcement of the law, which will come
into force three months after its official proclamation.




J-Power exits one coal plant project but remains bullish on existing thermal plants
(Sentaku, June edition)
•  J-Power announced on April 16 that it will give up on construction of a coal-fired power plant in
Ube City, but a person affiliated with major power companies in Japan said that this was more of a
token gesture to show that J-Power is doing its part for decarbonization. In reality, the company is
committed to continuing operations of coal-fired facilities, according to this industry source.
•  J-Power gave up on the 600 MW thermal plant in Ube after losing support from potential co-

investor Osaka Gas, among others. However, on the same day, J-Power said it would refurbish its
Matsushima thermal station in Nagasaki prefecture. After transforming the facility to IGCC from
2024, capacity should increase and operations will restart in 2026.
•  Major power utilities cheered the Matsushima development as they’d like the thermal power
business to continue.
•  J -Power has seven coal stations with 14 power units. Over 80% of its power sales are generated at

thermal power plants. What’s more, J-Power owns stakes in several Australian coal mines: 22.2% of
Clermont, 7.5% of Narrabri and 10% of Maules Creek. Based on its equity, J-Power’s attributable
annual coal production is around 3.9 million tons of coal.
•  J-Power is able to earn ¥38 billion annually from coal sales alone and prices are almost double
from last year’s low of $50 a ton.
•  J-Power will likely escape criticism for continuing to rely on coal.
•  The company’s emissions were at about 44 million tons of CO2 in FY2019, and this number will not

be able to drop by more than 40% in total.
•  The company has no problem securing funds from top banks in Japan.
•  One negative for the company is its declining share price, down 20%, YoY.



Sojitz and ENEOS team up on Australian solar farm project

(New Energy Business News, June 14)
•  Sojitz and ENEOS began building a 240 MW solar farm in Queensland, Australia, in conjunction
with Spanish construction company Grupo Gransolar.
•  The project represents the largest ever attempted by a Japanese company in Australia, and is
Sojitz’s and ENEOS’ first foray into the Australian market.
•  The 430-ha farm is scheduled to begin feeding the grid in late 2022.

Fukushima Dai-Ichi: Regulator deems radiation measurements unnecessary
(Tokushima Shimbun, June 18)
•  Nuclear Regulation Authority chair Sarata said there’s no legal requirement to measure
radioactivity levels of tritiated water discharged into the ocean from the Fukushima Daiichi site.
•  TEPCO will estimate radioactivity levels in discharged water based on the radioactivity of the water

in the tank and the water volume used to dilute it.

Growing scarcity of critical raw materials means Covid not only concern for Japan auto makers
(Nippon Hoso News Online, June 14/15)
o  Japan’s big car companies released financial results last month. While the Covid-19
pandemic forced many factories to close last year, operations at most have recovered.
Both Toyota and Honda report increased profits.

o  The picture is less rosy for Nissan, which is predicting zero profits in 2021/22, and
Mitsubishi, which is trying to reverse recent losses.
o  Serious shortages of semiconductors are also a major concern for Japan’s automobile
manufacturers. Shortages forced Honda and Mitsubishi to slash production. Partly to
blame are Covid-related factory closures combined with increased demand for video
games and computers as more people work from home.
o  Growing global demand for semiconductors could mean that the current shortages are

not an isolated incident.
o  The increasing scarcity of rare metals is also a subject of concern for carmakers as drivers
transition to electric and fuel-cell vehicles.

ANALYSIS

BY SAKI ISETANI

At Risk in Power Generation, LNG Makes New Friends in Japan’s
Shipping Lanes

As Japan’s imports of LNG for power plants continues to slide, in part due to
decarbonization, a new domestic buyer is emerging. The country’s shippers are
betting that super-chilled LNG will provide a near-term option to make a significant
dent in their emissions.

There are just three LNG-fueled ships operating in Japan at present, with most of the
rest running on oil-based bunker fuel. That number is due to jump by a factor of 40 or
more within this decade as part of the second of a three-stage transition by Japanese
shipping towards net-zero emissions by mid-century.

According to the World Bank, however, that’s a mistake. The bank recently called on
the shipping industry in Japan and elsewhere to skip LNG’s “transitional” stage and
make a direct leap into zero-emissions vessels.

While Japan is also developing ships that will run on electricity, hydrogen, or other
CO2-free sources, the country sees those technologies as commercially viable only
closer to 2030. In the meantime, key clients such as automakers are demanding cuts in
emissions now. The need to act quickly is part of what has accelerated a recent multi-
billion-dollar investment drive into LNG, a move that could lock Japan’s shipping into
using the fuel for at least two decades.


Japan shipping: an overview















• Japan has a 10% share of the global merchant fleet, or transports over 1 billion tons of cargo annually, on
over 2,500 merchant vessels. Japan also has a current market share of over 20% in new global
shipbuilding.

• Japan’s top shipping companies are Mitsui OSK (MOL), Nippon Yuen Kabushiki (NYK Line or NYK), and
Kawasaki Kisen (K Line). They are among the world’s 10 largest merchant fleet operators.

• Number of Japanese seagoing vessels of 1,000 gross tons and above: 3,910 (2020); of those around 3,001
are under foreign flag; 909 under the Japanese flag (data from UNCTAD’s Review of Maritime Transport
and the Japanese Shipowners Association).

• Number of LNG-fueled ships in the world: In 2010, there were just 18 LNG-fueled ships in the world. By
2019, this grew to 276, of which 162 were in operation and the rest were LNG-ready, according to MLIT
(Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism)

• First LNG-fueled ship in Japan: the Sakigake, a tugboat, started operation in Aug. 2015. It is owned by
Nippon Yuen Kabushiki (NYK Line). According to MLIT, two other LNG-fueled ships have since entered
service in Japan and seven more are in production.
o  NYK, which also owns one LNG-fueled vehicle carrier, this month announced plans to
build another 12 LNG-fueled vehicle carriers. Altogether, NYK expects to have 20 LNG-
fueled vehicle carriers by 2028 and as much as double that in terms of total LNG-fueled
ships a few years after.
o  By 2030, MOL could have 90 LNG-fueled ships, the firm said last week.
o  In total, by the end of the decade, Japan may count 120 or more LNG-fueled ships.

• How much LNG does one ship use: In November 2020, the world’s largest LNG-bunkering vessel, “Gas
Agility” carried out LNG bunkering to the world’s largest LNG-fueled container vessel “CMA CGM
Jacques Saade”, supplying a total of 17,300 m3 of LNG. This is enough fuel for a round trip voyage
between Rotterdam and Asia, according to MOL.

• Ports: several of Japan’s major ports from April wavered entry fees for ships fueled by LNG and hydrogen.


One step at a time
Japan’s shipping industry plans to decarbonize in three stages, according to a
roadmap adopted in April 2018 by MLIT. The plan’s first stage calls for short-term
measures that can easily reduce emissions without wholesale changes and improve
energy efficiency.

As an example, MOL announced an Air Lubrication System, also known as MALS,
which improves the energy efficiency of ships by creating a flowing layer of air
bubbles between the hull and seawater. This helps to reduce the resistance as the
ship moves through the water, which can cut CO2 emissions by up to 10-15%.

Part two of the plan sees Japan’s shipping start its switch to low-carbon fuels and
further improving energy efficiency. LNG is identified as the main fuel for this stage of
the process since it’s expected to reduce ships’ carbon release by between 25% and
30% compared to oil-based fuels. Aside from carbon, Japanese officials say LNG
would eliminate or significantly reduce other atmospheric pollutants such as sulfur
oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM).

Switching to LNG is not limited to building new ships. Some vessels can be retrofitted
to use LNG and are known as LNG-Ready Ships. That means changing the propulsion
system, while also adapting to LNG bunkering and security other LNG-fuel related
infrastructure in place.

So far, Japan’s shipping industry has wavered on a transition to LNG mainly out of
cost considerations. Ships fueled by gas tend to be about 20% more expensive than
their petrol version. Until Japan’s recent net-zero 2050 commitments, these expenses

| their petrol version. Until Japan’s recent net-zero 2050 commitments, these expenses |

were seen more as a luxury than a necessity.
However, Japanese companies, such as Toyota Motor Corporation, are now more
demanding that supply chains lower emissions, which follows similar moves by
overseas rivals. At the same time, private initiatives are pouring money into the
transition. A new ¥600 billion fund by Tokyo-based Anchor Ship Partners started this
year to offer lease financing for fuel-efficient new LNG carriers.

Not all are convinced that the lurch to LNG is indeed a good thing for the
environment. In a recent report called The Role of LNG in the Transition Toward Low-
and Zero-Carbon Shipping, the World Bank noted that methane, the largest
component of LNG, is roughly 86 times more potent over a 20-year time scale, and
this is a concern because the use of LNG can allow for a small percentage of methane
to slip into the atmosphere.


Final stage of shipping’s transition
The final phase of Japan’s shipping industry roadmap, from 2030-2050, sees the
commercial rollout of ships that operate on zero-carbon fuels.

There are several possibilities being explored. The first is a second transition from
LNG to carbon-recycled methane. (See the June 1 edition of Japan NRG Weekly for
details of Japan’s methanation strategy). Another is to move to either hydrogen or
ammonia fuels, or both, because they do not release CO2 when burnt. In both cases,
the fuels would need to emit almost zero GHG emission in the production,
distribution, and usage to qualify.

Importantly, the roadmap notes that these zero-emission ships would operate in
addition to LNG-fueled vessels. That’s because a ship, once launched, tends to stay in
service for about 20 years. The investment required to re-mold Japan’s shipping fleet
to LNG, including all the adjacent infrastructure in ports and at sea, also dictates that
the country is unlikely to abandon the fuel after this decade.

As with LNG, there are also drawbacks when employing “future” fuels for ships.
Besides the fact that hydrogen and ammonia are much more expensive compared to
conventional fuels, ammonia is also toxic and when emitted would release nitrogen
oxides. Liquified ammonia also requires a tank four times larger than for a ship
running on bunker fuel, making it difficult to commercialize.

In the case of hydrogen, a whole new infrastructure system that can cope with the gas’
volumetric energy density and transportation must still be built.

Given the technical and cost challenges, it’s unclear if Japan’s shipping will be able to
undergo two (or more) significant fuel transitions in the next two decades. That could
mean that LNG’s position in shipping could be secure for well into the future.

The Missing Links in Japan’s Carbon-Neutrality Plans

For the Steel Industry

Pressured to follow Japan’s net-zero commitments, the country’s top steel maker, and
one of its biggest CO2 emitters, offered not one decarbonization plan but three.

In a recent announcement Nippon Steel vowed to replace coal with hydrogen in its
steel production; to switch the type of furnaces it operates to a low-carbon option;
and to employ carbon capture, among other measures.

The problem for the company, which is single-handedly responsible for almost 8% of
Japan’s CO2, is that all of these actions are based on currently unavailable technology
or materials. The roadmap to a cleaner future for steel has several core missing links.

Unless Nippon Steel and its peers find near-term solutions, they could face a
curtailment of production volumes within a decade.


The three plans of Nippon Steel
Nippon Steel likes to stress just how energy-intensive the industry was. Indeed,
steelmaking accounts for 10% of Japan’s energy input.

Despite generating 89% of its own electricity, Nippon Steel has to buy another 3.8-
terawatt hours from outside suppliers. The company’s total power demand is
equivalent to half that of Singapore.

As a result, Nippon Steel released 94 million tons of carbon in 2019. Of that, 84
million tons of CO2 were directly from steelmaking.

The company has identified three action plans to reduce these numbers to 70 million
tons of CO2 in FY2030 and net-zero by 2050.

•  Gradually replace coking coal, a reduction agent that reacts with iron ore to make pig
iron, with hydrogen;
•  Build large electric arc-furnaces (EAF) to replace some pig iron production at blast
furnaces;
•  Advance the use of carbon recycling, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and similar
technologies.

The first plan is considered the ultimate goal, the golden standard for the industry’s
future. It proposes a wholly new steelmaking concept to replace coking coal, the most
polluting element, with CO2-free hydrogen. The exact technology is being developed
by the country’s top steelmakers, which also include JFE Steel and Kobe Steel, as well
as the state-backed research entity NEDO. The joint project is dubbed Course50.

This new hydrogen-driven furnace will allow for a 30% reduction in the release of
harmful gases, according to the Japan Iron and Steel Federation (JISF).

Steelmakers warn that a switch to hydrogen will be done in phases and Nippon Steel’s
25-30 million tons/ year of coking coal consumption will not be replaced by hydrogen
overnight – even after the first Course50 furnace is completed.

The development and introduction of the new technology could take well over a
decade. So, in the meantime, Nippon Steel expects to pursue the second plan: build
large EAFs to replace some pig iron production that currently takes place in a blast
furnace. The EAF’s carbon release is one quarter of that from the blast furnace. It also
utilizes steel scrap from dismantled buildings and scrapped cars as feedstock, which
promotes more recycling.

Nippon Steel said it will build the world’s largest EAF with a 4 million tons/ year
capacity in Setouchi, Japan, ready by 2022. It will install another giant EAF at the
Calvert plant in the U.S. by 2023. The Calvert plant is a 50-50 joint venture with
ArcelorMittal.

While EAF has less impact on the environment, it accounts for only a quarter of
Japan’s crude steel output. That’s because there is a trade-off involved. Due to the
impurities contained in scrap feedstock, EAF production is limited to ordinary-grade
steel, also called “carbon steel”. This metal degrades when exposed to intensive
moisture and ultraviolet lights.

Nippon Steel will need to refine its impurity control techniques to produce high-end
products such as electro-galvanized sheets (used in cars, energy infrastructure, and
domestic appliances) and high-tensile steel (used for engine parts, trucks, bridges,
and other high-stress environments).

|  |  |
|  | The elephant in the steelmaking room |
|  | There is something that neither of the first two plans by Nippon Steel addresses. |
|  |  |
|  | Steelmaking is a two-part process. The first involves making pig iron. The second is |

making that into a steel product.

In Part I, iron ore or steel scrap is added to coal and treated in a blast furnace, which
uses steam from coal as an energy source. EAF, as the name suggest, do not need
coal for the process but require large volumes of electricity, which in many countries
including Japan comes from coal-fired plants.

In Part II, pig iron is deoxidized before it is cast, rolled, cut and shaped into 30 or so
different forms like sheets, plates and tubes.

Part I accounts for roughly 60% of the total carbon emissions from steelmaking,
according to research by The Institute of Applied Energy Studies. The rest comes from
Part II and therein lies the problem.


First missing link: green electricity
Nippon Steel admits that the company’s current decarbonization plans will only
reduce emissions from the first half of the process. What happens in Part II depends
entirely on the availability of carbon-free electricity, a company official said.

As mentioned earlier, Nippon Steel generates 89% of its electricity in-house, and of
that four-fifth comes from gas cogeneration. In other words, from gas that’s released
inside a blast furnace during the iron ore-coal reaction. Cogeneration is more energy
efficient and less polluting than procuring electricity from a thermal power plant, but it
is not CO2-free.

However, even that efficiency and emissions saving mechanism is reduced if the steel
is no longer made in blast furnaces. Currently, Nippon Steel relies on the power from
cogeneration to run most of its Part II processes (the cast house, the rolling mills and
other finishing facilities).

Switching to an EAF or the new Course50 hydrogen-iron reduction technology will cut
carbon emissions in Part I, but also leave Part II without power.

Like most steelmakers, Nippon Steel also operates several coal-fired power plants to
secure a stable and cheap source of electricity for its factories. Retaining them will
require carbon capture or similar technology to reduce emissions. Closing them will
mean having to buy even more external electricity from providers, and Japan has
among the highest electricity prices in the world.

What’s more, given the need for uninterrupted, high-density power supply, the steel
industry has so far been wary of considering variable renewable energy sources.


Second missing link: hydrogen
Once Course50 furnaces are installed, Nippon Steel faces another issue: securing an
adequate supply of hydrogen and the cost associated with it.

Blast furnaces already generate hydrogen as part of the coal and iron ore reaction.
However, in that state hydrogen is mixed with other gases and cannot be easily
separated and then re-purposed for treating iron ore.

|  |

Creating new technology capable of separating the hydrogen in a cost-efficient
manner is considered decades away. In the meantime, steelmakers need to look
elsewhere for hydrogen.

Japan’s steelmakers will need 7 million tons of hydrogen to produce 75 million tons of
carbon-neutral pig iron in 2050, Nippon Steel informed the government earlier this
year.

Based on current estimates, the power sector would require another 5-10 million tons
of hydrogen, while the transport sector will need 6 million tons, according to Central
Research Institute of Electric Power Industry.

Today, Japan’s hydrogen capacity stands at about 2 million tons a year, according to
NEDO.


The “easiest” solution: shrink production
Given the vast energy problems and hydrogen shortages, some experts wonder if it’s
worth retaining the country’s steel sector at its current scale.

Last fiscal year, Japan produced 82.8 million tons of crude steel, a 52-year low.
Output dropped 16% due to the impact of the pandemic and slower economic
activity. And yet, Japan still exported 32.1 million tons of iron and steel products,
according to JISF.

As developing economies ramp up their own steelmaking capacities, demand for
Japanese steel will likely decrease and be limited to high-end products. Japan’s
shrinking and aging population is already hurting demand from key domestic buyers
of the metal – the housing and auto industries.

Aware that they could be a target for a government looking for ways to quickly reach
emissions goals, the steel industry has enlisted veteran lobbying support. This month,
several conservative lawmakers led by Hosoda Hiroyuki, the former deputy secretary
general of the ruling LDP party and Harada Yoshiaki, the former Minister of
Environment, formed a special task force to support the decarbonization of steel and
heavy industry.

The struggle promises to be intense. Steelmakers have among the strongest voices in
corporate Japan and are top employers. The industry will also claim that it could be
integral to the creation of an offshore wind supply chain in Japan.

How much of Japan’s steel capacity will stay in place by FY2030, of course, remains to
be seen. But one thing is certain - the country’s steel production is going to head
downward, and the age of high-polluting heavy industries is coming to an end.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Climate Change:
1). Severe heat waves in the Western and Southern U.S. - especially in Texas, Utah and
California - are threatening power outages as temperatures have reached their highest
levels in over 100 years. Grid operators in Texas and California are urging
conservation to avoid blackouts. Meanwhile, in some regions of China, electricity is
being rationed as power demand increased 15% YoY, and in Europe more coal is
being burned to meet power demand due to rising temperatures.
2). A team of 300 scientists who returned from an expedition to the North Pole in Q4
last year are warning of irreversible global warming based on 150 terabytes of data
accumulated over one year. The disappearance of summer ice in the Arctic is the most
obvious manifestation of global warming.
3). The UK Climate Change Committee warned last week that the UK is not adapting
fast enough to the impacts of climate change with episodes of extreme heat
becoming more frequent.
4). Concerns are growing over climate finance in the run-up to COP26 in the UK in
November. The global energy transition is estimated to cost $140 trillion by 2050 and
the rich countries’ target of providing $100 billion per annum is not being met.

Carbon Taxes:
The 27-member EU block is planning to introduce legislation in July that would tax
imports based on GHG emissions, making it the first global limit on carbon in
international trade.

Carbon Offsets:
Tree-tracking technology platforms used to substantiate carbon offset programs have
raised $44 million in financing, YTD. Barclays estimates that “investment in nature”
programs could generate $3.6 trillion of investments. Forestry and land use is the
second most popular offset program after renewable energy.

G7: Elimination of Unabated Coal:
The final G7 communique reinforced the policy that global investment in unabated
coal that fails to use carbon filtering is inconsistent with the Paris Agreement. The G7
countries also committed to halve GHGs by 2030 vs. 2010 and to mobilize $100
billion by 2025 to combat climate change.

EVs:
1). The Chief Executive and CFO of Lordstown Motors both quit following revelations
of amendments to annual reports filed with the SEC.
2). GM will invest $35 billion in EVs and autonomous vehicles by 2035, an increase of
30%, including the construction of two battery plants.
Aviation:

GE and Safron, the two largest makes of jet engines, will extend collaboration by a
decade to 2050 to produce jet engines that consume 20% less fuel by 2035.

Nuclear Power:
1). An increase in the concentration of gases at the Taishan 1 EPR in Guangdong
Province is related to damaged fuel rods according to China's National Nuclear Safety
Administration (NSSA). The NSSA said the increase is a regular phenomenon and is
still in accordance with the requirements of the plant's technical specifications.
France's EDF/Framatome, which designed the EPR and owns 30% of the Taishan NPP,
said the unit was experiencing a performance issue early last week. Taishan is 140 km
from Hong Kong.
2). One of Europe's largest battery energy storage systems is to be built at the
Olkiluoto nuclear power plant in Finland under a contract signed by Teollisuuden
Voima Oyj, the operator, and Hitachi ABB Power Grids. The 90 MW system will act as
a fast-start backup power source to ensure the stability of Finland’s energy network in
the event of an unplanned shutdown of the Olkiluoto 3 EPR unit, currently being
commissioned at the site.
3). Bill Gates’ nuclear power company, TerraPower, plans to apply for a construction
permit in 2023 and an operating license in 2026 for its Natrium fast reactor, according
to a plan sent to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. TerraPower and GE-Hitachi
Nuclear Energy Americas formed a JV in 2019 to develop the Natrium technology and
are backed by Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy, and PacifiCorp.
4). NRC in the U.S. has approved for the first time the use of higher enriched uranium
in conventional nuclear plants. The new fuel is referred to as HALEU and is enriched
5% to 20% compared with uranium in conventional nuclear plants that is only enriched
3% to 5%. This should improve reactor energy performance.

Biomass:
Following complaints from environmental groups and scientists, the EU will reconsider
whether use of wood pellets or organic waste counts towards renewable green energy
targets.

Fossil Fuels:
1). The share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix has not decreased over the last
decade according to REN21, the green energy policy network. Fossil fuels still
account for 80% of the global energy mix.
2). Climate campaigners are taking Norway to the European Court of Human Rights
over oil drilling in the Barents Sea inside the Arctic Circle, claiming that it breaches
their right to life. Norway is Western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer.

ESG:
1). In the U.S. the newly-appointed chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, has completed
solicitation of public comments on proposed changes in ESG reporting rules that aim
to bring consistency and comparability to climate risk reporting for U.S. listed
companies.
2). PwC, the global consultancy, will increase headcount by 100,000 and invest $12
billion in an ESG advisory expansion before 2025.
3). Legal & General, the UK’s largest investor, has blacklisted AIG over insufficient
policies on climate change risks including its exposures to the coal industry.

NATO: Carbon Neutrality:
The NATO military alliance has committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. Annual EU
military expenditure generates as much CO2 as 14 million cars and eight of the 10
NATO host countries are highly exposed to climate change according to SIPRI. A

switch from fossil fuels to synthetic fuels is thought to be the most feasible option for
the military alliance to reduce its carbon footprint.

Cryptocurrencies:
Tesla will reinstate Bitcoin for its automobile purchases once it establishes that 50% of
the consumed mining energy is clean.

China:
1). Several trillion dollars of trade in the Yangtze River estuary and Hangzhou Bay
regions are at risk of devastating impact of rising water levels due to climate change.
Shanghai, Suzhou, and Jiaxing are the most exposed Chinese cities in the region
according to the FT, with $1.5 trillion of annual GDP at risk.
2). Twelve people were killed in a gas explosion in Shiyan City in Hubei Province on
Sunday.
3). China will host an UN-sponsored biodiversity summit on Oct 11th to draft a new
global treaty on protection of ecosystems including forests and oceans.
4). The International Institute of Green Finance is reporting that 50% of Chinese-
backed overseas coal fired projects have been cancelled or shelved over the past six
years.
5). China is clamping down on Bitcoin mining in Sichuan Province due to excessive
electricity usage.

South Korea:
1). Three South Korean shipbuilders, Hyundai Heavy Industries, H-Line Shipping, and
SM Line are planning H2 2021 IPOs that could raise $3.3 billion as global shipping
volumes soar.
2). SK Group is being accused of greenwashing after finalizing a new $1.4 billion LNG
investment in the offshore Barossa-Caldita gas field in Australia after committing to
end all overseas oil and gas investments.

Cambodia:
The U.S. is ending a $100 million Cambodian aid program at a Wildlife sanctuary due
to worsening deforestation, illegal logging, and human rights abuses.

Belarus:
On Monday the EU may formally approve sanctions, including oil sanctions, against
Belarussian state companies. The sanctions against the state oil company,
Belneftekhim, could impact around $4.2 billion of Belarusian oil export revenues.

Ukraine:
Naftogaz Ukraine will take legal action against Russia’s gas monopoly, Gazprom
unless it unlocks gas supplies from Central Asia and releases them through Gazprom’s
pipelines in Ukraine. The gas flows have been blocked for 15 years.

Egypt:
The French government committed to provide over $2 billion of financing to Egypt
including for various power generation projects. The U.S. is also committing to assist
Egypt with its energy transition.
