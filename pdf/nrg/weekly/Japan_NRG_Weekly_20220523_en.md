Tokyo Gas, JAXA develop prototype of methane production that doesn't require hydrogen
(Japan NRG, May 17)
•  Tokyo Gas reported to the Methanation Government-Private Sector Council that the company has
developed a prototype that produces methane from carbon and water, and won’t require
hydrogen.
•  The system, called the hybrid Sabatier device, was based on technologies developed by the Japan

Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for application in space exploration. They combined
polymer electrolysis membrane technologies to electrolyze water, and a low-temperature Sabatier
reaction at 220°C in a single module to produce synthetic methane. Tokyo Gas and JAXA will scale
up the module in the next phase.
• TAKEAWAY: The new process promises to be more energy efficient and could open up a new fuel option for a
range of industries.



JFE considers converting steelworks into hydrogen hub

(Nikkei, May 16)
•  JFE Holdings is considering converting Nippon Steel’s Kawasaki steel works, which will cease
operations in 2023, into a port terminal for hydrogen and ammonia, and possibly even a hydrogen-
fired steel foundry.
•  The terminal would be built in conjunction with ENEOS.
•  The 700-ha site is located on an artificial island.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Tokyu Hotels successfully tests “world’s first hydrogen-powered hotel”

(Kankyo Business, May 16)
o  Tokyo Hotels said that one of its properties in Kawasaki successfully completed a trial
started in 2018 to have hydrogen fuel cells generate 30% of the facilities’ demand,
making it the "world's first hydrogen hotel."
o  The Kawasaki King Skyfront Tokyu REI Hotel used Showa Denko's plastic chemical
recycling facility to supply low-carbon hydrogen, produced from used plastic collected
locally, directly to the hotel via a hydrogen pipeline.

o  The hotel plans to move to the “social verification” stage of using hydrogen-fueled
electricity from January 2023.

investment. The ministry sees “dynamic capability” that captures market changes and “dynamic
creativity” that internalizes the changes and drives new products.
•  Structure of industries must change as well, to encourage more startups and to decentralize
corporate decision systems, METI told the Green Transformation panel. The index reflects
decarbonization efforts and dynamic capabilities.

• TAKEAWAY: METI is concerned about companies’ low level of R&D spending compared to other major
economies, as growth potentials decline. A lack of standards associated with decarbonization is also blamed
for a lack of investment, while some experts warn standards established too early will limit competition-driven
growth. METI minister told the Green Transformation Panel that the priority is to be first in the world to
establish a new market framework.



Japan to create Public Benefit Corporations to help tackle environmental issues
(Asia Nikkei, May 16)
•  PM Kishida plans a new structure to tackle environmental and social issues. It will be modeled on

the Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in the U.S. and elsewhere, and act as a tool to implement the
PM’s “new capitalism” vision.
•  PBCs pursue longer term rewards and aim to work in the public interest, as well as for its
shareholders. PBCs also invest in businesses and startups that seek to solve social issues more than
seek short-term profits.
•  Ministry discussions on the legal framework begin this summer and the relevant laws are expected
in 2023.



Japan’s ESG bond issuance more than triples despite headwinds
(Denki Shimbun, May 17)
•  Japan’s ESG bond issuance exceeded ¥500 billion in April, more than 3.5 times the level of April

2021, when the amount was around ¥140 billion.
•  Although there was no shortage of negative factors, such as the Ukraine war and the U.S. interest
rate hike, the momentum for bond issuance didn’t wane. In the energy industry, Kansai Electric
issued green bonds, and several energy companies plan to issue bonds in May.
•  April saw 20 ESG bond issuances. The breakdown according to Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities was: 2 environmental bonds, 9 social bonds, 5 sustainability bonds, and 4 sustainability-
linked bonds. Sustainability Bonds, and 4 Sustainability Linked Bonds.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ENEOS sells Japan’s first transition-linked bonds with unspecified use
(Sekiyu Tsushin, May 17)
o  ENEOS Holdings plans to issue transition-linked bonds to realize its plan for carbon
neutrality. The bonds will be the first of their kind in Japan with unspecified use of funds.
o  CONTEXT: Transition bonds help fund a firm's transition towards a reduced

environmental impact or to reduce carbon emissions. NYK Line, the shipping firm,
claimed in July 2021 that it was the first to issue transition bonds in Japan.
o  The terms of ENEOS’ bonds vary depending on the status of achievement of its
decarbonization goals. The group has a 2040 low-carbon, recycling-oriented vision.

Nuclear regulation authority approves Fukushima water release
(NRA statement, May 18)
•  The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) approved the plan by Tokyo Electric (TEPCO) to release
thorium-contaminated waste water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea. The

decision followed 13 reviews after TEPCO Holdings filed the plan details last December.
•  CONTEXT: TEPCO still needs to gain consent from local municipalities to start building the
facilities to carry out the discharge. The public will also be able to submit its views to the regulator
about the release of treated radioactive water. The final approval comes after those public
submissions are heard.
• TAKEAWAY: Little has changed since the plan was first mooted in the media several years ago, drawing

inevitable opposition from local fishermen and neighbors, South Korea and China. The Japanese government
can point to this approval by the regulator and the green light from the International Atomic Energy Agency
inspectors as evidence that the water release plan is sound from a scientific perspective. However, the issue
will likely continue receiving negative publicity regardless.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI minister, IAEA’s Grossi to deepen Fukushima water release engagement
(Government Statement, May 18)
o  METI minister Hagiuda and the IAEA’s secretary general Mariano Grossi agreed to
continue reviews of nuclear contaminated water released from the Fukushima power
plant and to keep the public informed. Japan also decided to provide a million euro fund

for IAEA’s educational programs.



Federation chair calls for serious debate on future of nuclear energy
(Reuters, May 20)
•  Ikebe Kazuhiro, head of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, said that serious debate is
needed on Japan’s nuclear energy policy.
•  Ikebe, who is also CEO of Kyushu Electric, said that unlike gas and coal-fired plants, fuel at nuclear

plants is responsible only for a small proportion of total running costs. As such, nuclear plants are
less susceptible to fluctuations in commodity prices and can help cut the power bills.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
IEE chair calls for serious debate on future of nuclear energy
(Nikkei, May 19)
o  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by Institute of Energy Economics Chief Economist

Koyama Ken.
o  Japan needs to reduce reliance on Russian commodities by building more renewable
generation, electrifying infrastructure, and making greater use of hydrogen.
o  But, nuclear power also has a role. Japan needs to recognize nuclear plants as a source
of baseload energy. The UK and France have already begun building new reactors. And
similar developments will be seen in Eastern Europe.

o  Japan should bear in mind that Russia can cut fuel supplies at some point, and it must
stockpile more oil.
• TAKEAWAY: Calls for a debate are one way to have the public change its mind on nuclear power. And, it
seems to be working, according to recent poll results. The public is increasingly supporting of the idea of

nuclear power as an essential energy source and as a decarbonization measure. When this translates into new
reactor restarts is another matter.



NEDO offers green funding to tech that extracts CO2 from exhaust gas
(Denki Shimbun, May 16)
•  NEDO will sponsor development of low-cost technologies to extract low-density CO2 from exhaust
gas as part of the state research hub’s Green Innovation Fund project.
•  NEDO selected seven themes to focus on, including exhaust gas from natural gas-fired power

plants, to be conducted by Chiyoda Corporation, JERA, and others. A total of ¥38.2 billion will be
invested in the project from until FY2030.
•  CONTEXT: The lower CO2 concentration and pressure in exhaust gas, much more energy and cost
are required for CO2 separation and recovery. This project targets exhaust gas with a CO2
concentration of 10% or less, aiming to achieve by 2030 a cost of ¥2,000/ ton of CO2 extracted.
•  Fund recipients also include the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE),

which will help develop a new solid absorber and test it.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toho Gas trials CO2 isolation from factory exhaust
(Denki Shimbun, May 18)
o  Later this month Toho Gas will commence a trial to isolate and recover CO2 from factory
emissions.
o  The facility in Aichi uses both membrane separation and physical absorption processes to

isolate CO2.
o  Toho Gas hopes the technology will be widely implemented in factories by the mid-
2020s.


MHI to launch small and mid-sized CCS

(Denki Shimbun, May 13)
•  In 2024, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will launch a module-type small- and medium-sized system for
CO2 capture.
•  Large custom-made systems for power plants and chemical plants are the mainstream, but the
company assumes that a wide range of industries will require such systems. The new system will
also include functions such as automatic operation and remote monitoring of equipment.
•  A demo will be ready in FY2023. MHI is working on CC trials with Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha for ships,

Tokuyama for cement, and Tokyo Gas for waste incineration facilities.

METI to issue power crunch warning two days in advance
(Japan NRG, May 17)
•  METI will issue power crunch warnings to consumers two days in advance, instead of at 16:00 the
day before the projected shortage. A forecast two days in advance, however, is not accurate since
the weather changes; thus, the warning is merely for reference and will not require energy
conservation. The warning will be issued when the area power reserve rate is likely to hit 5% or

less.
•  CONTEXT: For July, the Tohoku, Chubu and Tokyo areas’ projected reserve rates are 3.1%; and
5% for Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku, Kyushu and Hokuriku areas. For August, it is 4.9% for these eight
areas. This means that all of Japan, except Hokkaido and Okinawa, will possibly be subject to
power shortage warnings over July and August, and in that case it would be announced via the
internet and media.
•  Some METI advisors propose to expand the warning system to city gas.




Mitsubishi Corp relied on new pricing system to beat competition at offshore wind auctions
(Diamond, May 17)
•  Mitsubishi Corp managed to offer lower prices in last year’s offshore wind auctions partly because
its business model includes income from a new pricing system.
•  The “FIT Specific Wholesale Supply” program (Japanese name: FIT特定卸供給) allows power

companies to earn a premium for guaranteeing to a customer that their electricity comes from
specific sources of renewable energy. This premium is paid on top of the feed-in tariff (FIT).
•  The new system opens up a second income stream to Mitsubishi five years after the offshore wind
projects are operational. As this system is new and its application deemed uncertain, other bidders
did not consider making it part of their business plan.
•  Other factors that helped Mitsubishi offer a lower auction price: project management know-how
and cost-cutting skills of Dutch power giant Eneco, which the Japanese firm bought several years

ago; making a bulk order to GE for 134 wind turbines (for all three auction in which Mitsubishi
competed); and offering the three projects as a one-package deal to the construction consortium,
led by Kajima and Van Oord.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO exec “shocked” by low wind bid
(Asahi Shimbun, May 17)

o  TEPCO Renewable Power CEO Nagasawa Masashi said his consortium lost its bid to win
a lucrative government contract to build offshore wind farms in Akita and Chiba because
of the very low price tendered by the Mitsubishi consortium, which he said would be
competitive even in Europe.
o  Nagasawa was “shocked” by Mitsubishi’s bid and is skeptical whether the rival
consortium can actually deliver the project for the tendered price.

o  He said that while TEPCO Renewable Power could have reduced its bid through cost-
cutting measures, the company isn’t certain if it could have matched Mitsubishi’s bid.



Tohoku Electric and France’s Ideol consider floating offshore wind farm in Iwate area

(New Energy Business News, May 17)
•  Tohoku Electric and France-based BW Ideol will study a commercial-scale floating offshore wind
farm off the coast of Kuji City, Iwate Prefecture. A feasibility study will be done by March 2023,
based on the use of Ideol's floating foundation technology.
•  The area off the coast of Kuji City is classified as an "area that has progressed to a certain
preparatory stage" under the Renewable Energy Sea Area Utilization Law. In addition, Kuji City has

established the "Kuji City Floating Offshore Wind Power Generation Study Committee" to conduct

ranging from 4.2 MW to 6.1 MW. Commercial operation is expected to begin in May 2030.



Kyushu Electric to abolish cap on power tariffs, others may follow

(Asahi Shimbun, May 18)
•  The Kyushu Electric will do away with the cap on power tariffs charged to some domestic
subscribers.
•  The extent to which the utility can pass on higher fuel costs is limited by a scheme that protects
consumers; but as of October, some Kyushu Electric subscribers will no longer be protected by
that. There is speculation that other utilities will follow Kyushu’s lead.
•  Kyushu Electric is also phasing out a discount for subscribers who pay power bills by direct debit.

Japan’s April LNG imports up 12%, value soars 151% from a year ago
(Government Data, May 19)
•  Japan imported 5.57 million tons of LNG in April, up 12.1% from April 2021; while its import value
was ¥557 billion, up 151.6%. Thermal coal imports were 8.2 million tons, up 7.4%; while their
import value was ¥253 billion, up 201%. Crude oil imports were 14.1 million kl, up 9.4%; while their
value was ¥1.18 trillion, up 99.3%.




Japan’s LNG stocks rise to 2.13 mil tons
(METI Statement, May 18)
•  Japan’s LNG stocks on May 15 stood at 2.13 million tons, up from 2.02 million tons a week earlier.
End of May stocks last year were 1.94 million tons, and the four-year end May average was 1.98
million tons.

•  CONTEXT: While LNG stocks by power utilities are above average levels, those of gas utilities are
below, METI told the gas and power panel.
• TAKEAWAY: European gas storage is filling up at faster than usual rates. The relative abstention by the
Japanese buyers in the spot market especially indicates they are waiting for European demand to ease before
stepping in to secure their own volumes, thus easing head-to-head competition for cargos.



Exports of refined oil products rise 16.11% in March
(METI Statement, May 18)
•  Japan exported 2.4 million kiloliters of refined oil products in March, up 16.11% year-on-year.

7.2% to 0.7 million kl.



Tokyo Gas hits tariff cap
(Nikkei, May 20)
•  Tokyo Gas has “maxed out” the level of fuel cost increases that it can pass on to subscribers.
•  A consumer protection scheme prevents the utility from passing on fuel costs to around a third of

its subscribers once fuel costs exceed standard levels by over 60%.
•  Tokyo Gas will therefore have to absorb any future increase in fuel costs when supplying

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Once Trash, Used Cooking Oil Now Center of Tug-of-War
Between Food and Jet Fuel

The battle for resources between food and energy is decades old. Yet the latest
iteration of the food-versus-fuel debate has taken a new twist in Japan as the country’s
attempts to clean up its aviation are colliding with a parallel need both to feed its
livestock and lower their associated emissions.

What’s even more uncanny: The material agonized over in this moral dilemma was
considered trash just a decade ago. Now, producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)
and makers of animal feed claim used cooking oil (UCO) is essential to their
decarbonization strategies and want their supply protected.

The complex relationships between food materials and energy are coming to light in a
new way since the start of the war in Ukraine, which is one of the world’s top grain
exporters. A myriad of industries across the globe are in flux, with major players
clashing and scrambling to secure resources amidst ever-tightening supplies of just
about everything.

This new economics of deficit is leading to a fundamental restructuring of the global
economy that will be felt for years if not decades to come.


Sizzling hot export
Each year, Japan generates around 400,000 tons of UCO from food manufacturers,
which generate over 30% of the total, followed by restaurants, supermarkets and
convenience stores. Japan’s total surpasses that of Germany, which is Europe’s largest
UCO producer.

In 2021, Japan annually exported an estimated 120,000 tons of UCO to Singapore,
Malaysia and elsewhere. But from there, the cooking oil was often re-exported to
Europe to be used as renewable fuel. Finland’s Nesta Oil, a major renewable fuel
supplier, is believed to be the largest buyer, although it declined to elaborate on its
UCO sourcing.

UCO exports, 2017-2021

In addition, due to the recent rise in palm oil prices, some Japanese biomass
operators are reportedly eyeing a switch to UCO despite the ¥7/ kWh lower feed-in-
tariff rates of the latter. The renewables energy players see this as an affordable
alternative feedstock.

And then there are the airline companies, which seek UCO as a potential raw material
to make SAF, a bio fuel that mixes biomass with regular jet fuel from crude oil to lower
end-user emissions. The push to ‘green’ the aviation industry comes on the back of
recent tightening of global regulations for the sector.

Earlier this year, Japan’s government set a goal of replacing 10% of aviation fuel used
by domestic firms (which is around 1.3 billion liters) with SAF by 2030. The plans
include the creation of a test hub for SAF at Chubu International Airport later this year.
And several domestic firms including top oil refiner ENEOS are due to roll out
domestic manufacturing of SAF from around 2025 to 2027. But until then, Japan’s top
two airlines, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines (JAL), are reliant on imports
or small-scale domestic production projects.

With so many big companies with considerable financial resources showing interest in
used cooking oil, the traditional buyers from the agriculture sector are getting
squeezed out.

Animal feed manufacturers and farms are getting hit from left, right and center, said
one feed manufacturer official.

“Since UCO is short, we need to buy more expensive raw materials, but it’s difficult to
pass on the cost rises to food,” said the official, adding that PM Kishida’s government
is driven more by energy security issues with food security in second place. The official
said he feels the hierarchy is all wrong.

“If we have no food, we cannot live. Simply put, there will be no question of energy
security” if food security is not addressed, he added.

UCO buyers in the energy sector, however, raise their eyebrows at such talk and retort
that the feed manufacturers are using the notion of “food security” as a way to
pressure suppliers.

Since the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has oversight over the UCO
supply chain, animal feed is high on suppliers’ priority list. Presently, local UCO buyers
in the feed sector are paying much less than overseas buyers, around ¥90-100/ kg.
The prices are pegged to the quarterly feedstock price index comprising international
grain price benchmarks and exchange rates.

UCO is a cheap resource to raise feed calories in animal feed. (Cow feedstock, which
can’t use UCO due to foot and mouth disease control, uses palm oil products mixed
with grain.) More oil in feed also reduces methane released from belching, and so its
inclusion in animal feed is seen as part of the global effort in reducing agriculture’s
GHG emissions.

The feed manufacturers, on the other hand, have argued that vegetable oil products
are imports, which in turn raises food security risks at a time when Japan’s food
sufficiency is already too low. At the end of the day, local production for the local
consumption model needs to spread into all sectors in order to reduce Scope III
emissions.


Japan’s clean product
There’s nothing new about the re-use of UCO as fuel in Japan. Since 1997, UCO has
been reprocessed as a diesel oil replacement by Kyoto City and a dozen other
municipalities. However, the sudden and dramatic rise in global demand due to
climate initiatives has been a shock for the agricultural sector, said a METI official.

For decades, UCO was a strong buyer’s market and suppliers were literally begging
feed manufacturers to take the oil at any price. This re-use as diesel had limited
appeal due to poor cost performance, and before the sustainability boom suppliers
had little bargaining power.

In the last two years, the power balance has changed dramatically.

“Japanese UCO was popular overseas because of its high quality,” said Shiomi
Masato of Japan’s UCO Business Federation, adding that oil quality used for food
production is strictly regulated. In Japan, any company producing UCO needs to fully
track the oil until disposal, providing full traceability of the product life cycle.

This strict quality control has played no small part in Japanese UCO’s recent doubling
in price, now fetching ¥150/ kg for exports on semi-annual or annual contracts. Shiomi
believes overseas buyers can afford to pay high prices since some governments
subsidize procurement in an effort to increase renewables. Other experts, however,
pointed out that emissions from ship transportation also need to be factored in when
determining just how green the fuel truly is.

Suppliers also fear losing robust overseas demand due to unexpected regulatory
changes and want to keep their traditional customers happy. In April this year, due to
rising costs, Finland lowered the biofuel requirement in road transport fuel to 12%
from 19.75%.


Deep-frying to save the planet
As a way to ameliorate conflicts between the energy sector and the animal feed
industry, the government has started to look into a new supply source – UCO from
homes. It can’t be used for animals due to a lack of traceability; and precisely because
of this, some countries don’t recognize UCO from homes as sustainable.

Shiomi estimates 100,000 tons/ year of UCO could be gathered from homes and
municipalities. Toward that goal, the MoE has said that it will subsidize companies,
universities and municipalities that seek to develop technologies to reprocess UCO
from homes into a suitable source of SAF.

If those efforts are successful, that would boost overall Japanese UCO by 25%, to an
annual level of around 500,000 tons. This could play a significant role in meeting SAF
demand as Japan’s aviation industry tries to green its fuel supply.

However, in the rush to meet SAF demand, Japan’s food security could to some
extent be compromised. Finding a balance between the interests of food, power and
fuel industries will be crucial if UCO is to continue to play a role in the energy
transition.

Renewable Energy Procurement Options in Japan

Anyone looking to procure renewable energy for a business in Japan has four basic
options: purchasing renewable energy certificates, signing up for one of the
renewable energy plans offered by power retailers, building your own generation
capacity, or signing a corporate PPA with a power generator.

Naturally, each option comes with advantages and disadvantages.


Option #1: Purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates
Renewable energy certificates are used by corporate power consumers to offset
carbon emissions and to prove they consume “green energy,” at least on paper. The
main advantage is the ease of purchase and the flexibility of procured volume.

The downside is that the actual power that the certificate buyer consumes doesn’t
necessarily come from a renewable power source. By extension, purchasing
certificates doesn’t directly result in new renewable capacity added to the grid.

In Japan, there are three categories of renewable energy certificates:
●  non-fossil value certificates issued by METI;
●  J-Credits issued by METI, MoE, and MAFF; and
●  Green Power certificates issued by certified private companies.

As all generation under the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme results in the creation of non-
fossil value certificates, it’s not surprising that this type of certificate is by far the most
prevalent. Non-fossil value certificates (NFC) were once the only ones available for
purchase by retailers, but the scheme has been broadened to allow end-users to buy
certain types of certificates directly, similar to how the J-Credits and Green Power
certificates work.

All three certificates are valid for CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) and SBT (Science
Based Targets) schemes. Not all can be used for RE100. In 2020, the Agency for
Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) expanded the scope of NFCs from renewable
energy sources as part of the FIT program to all renewable-generated electricity, as
well as electricity from other non CO2-emitting sources such as nuclear.


Option #2: Retailers’ Renewable Power Plans
Another easy way to procure green power in Japan is through retailers offering
specific “renewables electricity” purchase plans whereby power is bundled with
renewable energy certificates. This makes logistics simpler as you won’t have to
procure the two separately.



19


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

While some retailers have rules that the power they procure must result in new
renewable capacity being installed, in general, using this method in Japan does not
directly add new renewable capacity to the grid.
Shizen Energy is one retailer that offers renewable power plans. Customers can
choose from plans with renewable certificates covering 3%, 30%, or 100% of
consumption.























Option #3: Onsite Self-Generation and Self-Wheeling
The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar in Japan dropped from about ¥40/ kWh
a decade ago to below ¥10/ kWh in recent capacity auctions. With the LCOE reaching
the price levels of power procured through retailers, installing solar panels on factory
rooftops and other similar surfaces is now an economically viable option even for
consumers not necessarily looking to utilize self-generation for resiliency purposes.

With the LCOE of solar forecasted to drop to as little as ¥5.8/ kWh by 2030, the
popularity of this option is expected to further increase.

Self-generation decreases a company’s dependence on the grid, results in new
renewable capacity added into the power generation mix, and requires minimum
operating costs. At the same time, it requires a considerable investment up front.

As an example of companies utilizing this method, in 2017, Ikea installed a 1.3 MW
solar power plant on the rooftop of one of its retail stores in Aichi Prefecture. It
expects the investment to pay for itself within 10 years.

If a company lacks the space to build an onsite power plant then there’s the option of
self-wheeling: build the power plant offsite and then deliver the generated power
through the public grid for their own consumption.



20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Two examples of that are Kyocera and Sony. The former self-wheels power from a 150
kW solar power plant to its Shiga factory located two kilometers away, and the latter
self-wheels surplus power generated via its 1.7 MW Shizuoka product storage site
rooftop solar power plant to one of its factories in Shizuoka.


Option #4: Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)
The fourth and final major option that companies looking to procure renewable power
in Japan have are corporate PPAs. As part of these bilateral agreements, companies
agree to offtake power from specific generators for a fixed period of time, typically up
to 20 years.

Doing so helps companies minimize the risk associated with power price volatility
(PPAs typically have fixed prices), avoid having to pay fixed upfront costs associated
with self-generation, and – in cases where a PPA is signed before a certain power
plant is developed – add new renewable capacity to the grid.

Corporate PPAs come in three forms: onsite physical, offsite physical, and virtual.
While the first two result in physical power supplied from a specific power plant
directly to the consumer, virtual PPAs are derivative contracts involving the trade of
renewable energy certificates and power via the wholesale market.





















Examples of physical PPAs executed or planned to be executed in Japan include:
●  Aeon – Will sign onsite PPA contracts to power 200 of its retail stores over the next
couple of years
●  Tokyo Gas – Signed a corporate PPA with 65 public elementary and junior high
schools; will install 0.06 MW PV panels and storage batteries at each; the schools can
also use it as emergency power during outages
●  Seven-Eleven – Has an offsite corporate PPA with NTT Anode Energy; NTT will build
two solar plants to power 40 convenience stores and one shopping mall

Virtual PPAs have not yet been implemented in Japan.

Choosing the Best Option for Your Company
Overall, the use of renewable energy certificates is by far the most common method
of going green in Japan, with corporate PPAs also increasing in popularity.
There are a number of factors to consider before choosing the most appropriate of
the four options, such as:

●  Level of commitment to go green – Do you want to simply be able to say you use
renewable energy, or do you also want your actions to result in new renewable
capacity added to the system?
●  Participation in sustainability initiatives – Do you need your option to be valid from the
point of view of initiatives such as RE100?
●  Flexibility of procured volume – Can you commit to a certain, relatively stable level of
power consumption for the long term or do you need a degree of flexibility?
●  Preferred financial structure – Are you willing to invest considerable resources up front
to build your own generation capacity or do you prefer to pay as you go?

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ CCS
Chevron's carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at the Gorgon LNG plant in
Western Australia has only reached half its capacity during its three years of operation.
The project, which is the world's largest, was designed to store 4 million tons of CO2
annually, but in 2021 it only took in 2 million tons.

Australia/ SAF
Synthetic fuel could replace petroleum and plant-based biofuels by the mid-2030s,
according to a Qantas airline official. The airline is investing $50 million to develop
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that won’t compete with food production (as crop-based
biofuel does). This so-called “power-to-liquid technology” could be the holy grail of
SAF.

ESG/ Net-zero goals
On the occasion of its first climate report, New York-based financial services company
and pension fund TIAA, which has $1.4 trillion in assets under management, announced
its net-zero goal by 2050 for its General Account, real estate portfolio and corporate
operations. TIAA’s General Account covers about $285 billion in assets.

EU/ Carbon emission permits
Brussels plans to raise €20 billion by selling extra carbon emissions permits. The funds
would help EU countries to escape Russian energy dependence. Critics, however, say
that more certificates would drive down the carbon price, thereby making it cheaper to
use coal, oil and gas, which in turn could discourage the transition to renewables.

EU/ Wind power
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands say they’ll build at least 150 GW of
offshore wind capacity in the North Sea by 2050. Some of this power would be used to
make hydrogen and green fuels for heavy industries and transportation.

EVs/ Essential raw materials
Electric vehicles overtook smartphones and PCs as far as demand for cobalt used in
lithium-ion batteries, reported the UK-based Cobalt Institute. As sales of EVs and
hybrids doubled, the car industry consumed 59,000 tons of cobalt in 2021, 34% of the
total. About 26,000 tons of cobalt were used in mobile phones and 16,000 tons in
laptops and tablets.

India/ Energy crisis
In a special report, Reuters analyzed why India is facing its worst power crisis in years.
A heatwave has hit South Asia, causing widespread power outages due to increased
air-conditioning demand. In addition, post-pandemic economic recovery has also
pushed power demand to record highs.

Italy/ Gas payments
Eni will open a rubles account in Gazprombank to comply with Kremlin demands for
gas sales. Russia accounts for nearly 40% of Italy’s total gas imports. Earlier this
month, Poland and Bulgaria decided not to comply and Gazprom soon halted gas
supplies to both.

Panama/ SAF
A team of energy companies led by SGP BioEnergy will develop a bio-refinery to
produce low-carbon aviation fuel. When completed in late 2026, Biorefineria Ciudad
Dorada will be the largest of its kind, annually producing 2.6 billion gallons of
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable marine diesel.

U.S./ Shale oil
This year, American shale oil companies will have revenues of about $180 billion,
according to Rystad Energy. This figure will surpass all that shale drillers have earned
over the past 20 years. Industry CEOs, however, are careful about investing in new
capacity, and plan to spend the extra cash on dividend payouts, debt reduction, and
stock repurchases.
