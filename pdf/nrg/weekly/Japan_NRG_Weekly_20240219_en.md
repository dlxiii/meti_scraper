Japan’s first issue of Climate Transition Bonds is oversubscribed, almost ¥800 billion sold

(Government statement, Feb 14)
•  The Ministry of Finance announced the results of bidding for the inaugural sale of Japan's 10-year
Climate Transition Bonds. These bonds will support CO2 emission reduction in specific high-
polluting sectors.
•  On offer were ¥799.5 billion of bonds. The bidding amount was three times greater: ¥2.32 trillion.
•  These bonds have an interest rate of 0.74%; the redemption date is Dec 20, 2033.
•  CONTEXT: Regular 10-year Japanese government bonds yielded 0.755% on Feb 14, according to

Reuters.
• TAKEAWAY: This is the first sale in a ¥20 trillion, decade-long program envisaged by PM Kishida as a way to
kickstart an even larger ¥150 trillion wave of spending to transform the Japanese economy by reducing its
carbon footprint. The proceeds are expected to go towards projects in wind, hydrogen, batteries, nuclear, SAF
and cutting-edge hardware and software that will power developments in digital and AI. Contrary to some
media reports, the remit of the bonds also includes ammonia-related projects.

Climate transition bonds are a new class of bonds created by Japan to promote steps towards CO2 reduction
that fall outside of the remit of traditional green bonds, which focus primarily on renewable energy. The bond
category will bring financing to hard-to-abate sectors, but not only. Many will be watching these bonds to see
whether these sales stimulate interest in a new sub sector of financial instruments related to decarbonization.




Japan, Korea to set up hydrogen / ammonia cooperation framework

(Government statement, Feb 16)
•  The ANRE Director for Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy, and his counterpart in the
Hydrogen Economy Policy Bureau of South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy agreed
to set up a framework for hydrogen / ammonia cooperation.
•  Cooperation will include global supply chain building and application development, setting codes
and standards, and sharing experiences for policy implementation.
•  CONTEXT: In November, PM Kishida proposed to South Korean President Yoon to build hydrogen

and ammonia supply chains together.
• TAKEAWAY: There is clearly a geopolitical angle to this given the rapprochement between the two countries
since President Yoon took office. However, there is also a valid business case for the two countries to
collaborate in the formation of the new hydrogen and ammonia sector; Japan and South Korea were the
leaders in LNG and spearheaded its growth from a niche into one of the world’s largest energy markets. There
are also some who believe that hydrogen transportation and storage will follow similar engineering solutions to

that of natural gas / LNG.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
MOL joins Korean-Australian liquefied hydrogen consortium in marine fuel sector
(Company statement, Feb 14)
o  Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) joined a consortium studying the use of liquefied hydrogen in
marine transportation in Asia. The study is conducted by Woodside Energy, HD Korea

Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering, and Hyundai Glovis.
o  If the project goes ahead, then Woodside would produce and deliver hydrogen to ports;
HD KSOE would design and build a vessel with a 80,000 m3 tank.
o  Hyundai Glovis and MOL would provide input on vessel design regarding propulsion and
handling of liquefied hydrogen. The first ships could start operation by 2030.
o  CONTEXT: The 80,000 m3 tank will have a capacity to carry 4,800 tons of liquefied

hydrogen. The ship is half the size of the CC61H hydrogen carrier developed by
Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which is possibly the world’s largest.



Kishida’s Cabinet approves proposed CCS, Hydrogen Acts

(Government statement, Feb 13)
•  The PM’s Cabinet approved the proposed CCS Business Act, and the Act to Promote Low-Carbon
Hydrogen Supply and Drive Green Transformation.
•  The CCS Business Act defines rights and liabilities associated with carbon capture and storage, and
a new licensing system.
•  The Low-Carbon Hydrogen Act will set subsidies to build hydrogen and ammonia hubs, and to fill
the gap between costs and end-user prices.
•  CONTEXT: The House of Representatives will discuss the proposals in coming weeks.

• TAKEAWAY: The swift passing of the Cabinet stage shows the importance that Japan’s govt places on the
development of a CCS industry. Several CCS projects in Southeast Asia are waiting on this legislation to serve
as a framework for their own development.




LDP council on energy transition to focus on innovative wind and solar power tech
(Nikkei, Feb 14)
•  The ruling LDP lawmakers’ council on the energy transition, and related next-gen tech, held a

general meeting on Feb 14.
•  Deputy PM Aso, an advisor to the group, said focus should be on tech such as floating offshore
wind power and new types of solar modules that can attach to walls.
•  Aso suggested hearing from experts on recent developments in wind and solar power generation;
ANRE and other experts stressed the importance of domestic production of wind turbines, given
the absence of Japanese manufacturers.
• TAKEAWAY: There are several LDP lawmaker groups on the energy transition. This is the newest group,

formed last year. The Lawmakers Federation to Promote and Expand Renewables, which was formed about a
decade ago, has been advocating floating offshore wind and perovskite solar tech development but the group
lost steam following the arrest of the federation secretary general Akimoto Masatoshi for alleged bribery.

Sumitomo to partner with U.S. biofuels company to produce SAF
(Company statement, Feb 7)
•  Sumitomo Corp of Americas will partner with Louisiana Green Fuels (a subsidiary of Strategic
Biofuels) to develop a $700 million biorefinery project. Construction on the project is expected to

begin in early 2025.
•  Sumitomo agreed to a 20-year offtake for renewable fuels produced by LGF.
•  SAF will be the main renewable fuel product, and annual production could reach 2.4 mln metric
tons. The biorefinery will utilize sequestered carbon.
•  Sumitomo will lead in organizing a Japanese consortium to help fund the biorefinery. The State of
Louisiana is pledging a $200-million tax-free bond allocation.




NRA to update guidelines for indoor sheltering in case of nuclear accidents
(NRA statement, Feb 14)
•  On Feb 14, the NRA began discussions on updating indoor sheltering and evacuation guidelines
to brace for nuclear incidents.

•  The Jan 1 earthquake near the Noto Peninsula showed that increased incident preparedness is
required as the quake resulted in community isolation and major damages, chairman Yamanaka
said.
•  The NRA plans to set up a task force to review the guidelines within this fiscal year, aiming to
update them in FY2024.
•  The task force is expected to study combining temporary shelters and evacuations to flexibly cope
with diverse situations, as well as issues like when to lift emergency procedures, etc.




Sekisui Chemical, Slovakia ink perovskite MoU
(Company statement, Feb 13)
•  Sekisui Chemical and the Ministry of Economy of Slovakia signed an MoU to study the

implementation of perovskite solar cells (PSC), including regulatory issues.
•  Slovakia will engage with its agencies and universities to identify challenges and possible solutions,
and assess PSC’s potential in carbon neutrality, as well as business strategies in the EU market.
• TAKEAWAY: METI’s approach to PSC has been protectionist, calling it the “rising sun technology” and
discouraging cooperation with foreign firms. But now METI is changing its tune and seems open to
international collaborations. In January, another PSC tech firm EneCoat Technologies delivered a presentation

to investors in Singapore.
Sekisui’s R&D goal is to set up automated mass manufacturing of one-meter wide modules. However, these
have low power efficiency of 15% and need large installation areas to be a reliable power source. Some
researchers question Sekisui’s research, saying small modules could be fastened together for large

installations. European PSC firms address the performance issue by developing “tandem modules”, which
combine perovskite and silicon or another material to raise power efficiency to over 20%.

(Company statement, Feb 9)
•  Chubu Electric, consultancy firm

Nippon Koei, and SeED Okinawa inked
a consulting service agreement with the
Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA) for a decarbonization
project on the Galapagos Islands.
•  The firms will work with the
government of Ecuador to set

METI ready to move Hokkaido sites into second stage of review for nuclear waste hub

(Jiji Press, Feb 13)
•  METI has approved moving suitability reviews at Suttsu and part of Kamoenai, both in Hokkaido
Pref, to the second stage. The localities are under assessment as potential hosts of a national hub
for the final disposal of highly radioactive waste.
•  CONTEXT: Both candidate sites passed the first stage of review, a so-called literature survey. The
next stage is an “overview” survey. The third and last stage is an “elaborate survey”. Each stage is
a multi-year process.
•  In the first stage, which started in late 2020, the Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NUMO)

collected data about each area’s geological stability based on existing documentary evidence.
NUMO will now proceed with the second phase, which requires on-the-ground work, such as
boring.
• TAKEAWAY: While naming the two sites is good news for NUMO, the entire process can take up to 20 years,
and approval is never guaranteed. Also, geological inquiries have shown that only a tiny part of Kamoenai
(near an active volcano) is actually feasible as a waste site, which limits potential development. But beyond the

geology, NUMO will need to navigate local politics. Hokkaido’s current governor, whose approval is needed
for continuing the selection work, has previously expressed strong opposition to the prefecture hosting a
nuclear waste hub. In a Feb 13 statement, Gov. Suzuki repeated his opposition, saying that the current surveys
were allowed without any intention of accepting the import of nuclear waste to Hokkaido and that he intends
to “take appropriate measures after the NUMO report is compiled and the necessary national procedures are
completed.” However, it is unlikely that METI sees no hope of winning over Hokkaido authorities in the future.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Editorial: Transparency is essential in selecting nuclear waste final disposal sites
(Asahi Shimbun, Feb 14)
o  CONTEXT: Asahi Shimbun is one of Japan’s main left-leaning newspapers.
o  The govt must recognize the complexities of nuclear waste disposal, especially in

earthquake-prone Japan. NUMO's survey indicated potential sites. Yet, the issue of
natural disasters must be sufficiently addressed.
o  Some scientists have raised doubts about plans for site selection in areas with significant
tectonic activity.
o  Municipalities hesitate to commit to surveys, due to fears of irreversible decisions and
reliance on government subsidies. Overall, there are concerns over transparency and

accountability in decision-making.

EEX Power Futures: January trading volume double that of Dec; hits record
(Company statement, Japan NRG, Feb 15)
•  Electricity futures trading on the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Japan saw record volumes in
January. Around 5.58 TWh of futures contracts traded in the first month of 2024, up from the 2.8

TWh volume of Dec 2023.
•  The full year 2023 volume was 18.3 TWh and January 2024 reached a third of this total.
•  Seasonal trading remains active, accounting for 60% of the total.
•  CONTEXT: According to EEX, February's trading volume continues increasing and is approaching
January levels. EEX plans to introduce USD-denominated TTF gas futures in April to improve
convenience for European and Japanese power generators.
• TAKEAWAY: The futures market, which EEX dominates in Japan, has grown rapidly in the last three years even

if the recent acceleration has taken some by surprise. The EEX trading volume is now equivalent to over a
quarter of the spot volume (which is traded on the JEPX). But in most countries, the derivatives market is
bigger than the wholesale spot market, which makes traders believe there is still room for further volume
expansions. New players are joining the market on a regular basis. In January, Danske Commodities joined as
a new participant and the latest name linked by the media with market entry is Vitol Group. As of Feb 1, there
were 68 market participants.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JEPX spot volume for January up 1.5% MoM amid warm weather
(Denki Shimbun, Feb 15)
o  Average daily trading volume on the electricity spot market (JEPX) in January was 681

GWh, an increase of 1.5% MoM.
o  January saw unusually high temperatures, which led to lower heating demand, with the
highest price only barely rising above ¥20/ kWh. The Noto Peninsula earthquake that
occurred on New Year's Day did not cause any noticeable price spikes.
o  January’s total traded spot volume reached 21.14 TWh, or 26.7% of total electricity
demand. This was a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to December.

LPG shipping rates to Asia fall due to a drop in U.S. exports and warmer weather

(Nikkei, Feb 8)
•  On Feb 2, shipping rates for LPG from the Middle East to Asia hit a three-year low, declining 80%
to under $32 / ton. In 2022, rates were over $180 / ton.
•  This drop is due to rising U.S. propane prices caused by a cold snap. Thus, Middle Eastern
propane is more competitive. Also, disruptions in the Panama and Suez Canals have forced ships
to take longer routes, raising transportation costs.
•  Another factor was lower demand for LPG in Asia, due to warm winter temperatures and low

demand from China.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Can Solar Cars Jump from Promising Experiment to the Real Road
A year ago, the Kawasaki city authority launched a zero-emission EV station that
charges with solar power generated from the panels installed on the garage rooftop.
However, a half-day was needed to fully recharge a Toyota Motor model C-Pod,
which is a two-seat EV. Needless to say, this frustrated the driver.


The city authority could only
suggest multiple recharges, which
clearly isn’t a viable option in
everyday life. But what if there
was another option. What if an EV
driver had a solar-powered car
with panels on the car’s roof. This
revolutionary idea would forgo
the need for charging stations,
and could potentially upend the
current dominant EV model and
its charging paradigm.

Across the globe, inventors and
engineers have already made test drives of such prototype solar cars. The same is true
in Japan, which could lay claim to being one of the leaders in this area, and is making
significant strides thanks to state support.

Several miles of uninterrupted drives have been clocked, but getting such a solar-
powered vehicle to travel long distances on a single charge remains a challenge. If the
technical and cost issues can be solved, then solar cars could trigger the next mobility
revolution. But what is the current status of the technology?

Solar car as state project
Japan’s ambition is to lead the global effort to create standards for mobility systems,
which explains why solar car development has been taken under the wing of the New
Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

During FY2015-2019, NEDO conducted research to develop high-performance solar
batteries for cars. In 2019, the project moved onto the field study phase. Nissan Motor
and Toyota Motor test drove mini-vans and sedans mounted with solar modules on
public roads. Then, in November last year, Sharp, which developed the modules,
announced plans to commercialize solar-powered cars.

Sharp’s solar modules posted a power efficiency of 33.7%, a world record for a 775
square-centimeter-sized module. It’s made of gallium arsenic compound, which is very
expensive, and silicon. Resembling a film, the module’s thickness is 0.03 mm, and it
can be set up on curved vehicle surfaces, resulting in a total power capacity of 1.15
kW. On a sunny day, the modules generate 800 watts of power, enough for a 50 km
drive.

The 33.7% efficiency is also close to the theoretical limit of silicon module power
generation. Hence, Sharp decided to pursue the module commercialization, rather
than doing more R&D to raise the power efficiency further. The commercialization
target for the solar car is 2025-2030.

As Japan NRG reported (Nov 13, 2023 issue), the major commercialization challenge
is cost. About 1,000 pieces of 775-sq-cm modules were put on top of the car’s
bonnet, rooftop and rear. While Sharp wouldn’t comment, one source familiar with the
car said the modules alone cost about ¥25 million, which is more expensive than the
car itself.

Startup PXP develops cheaper solar car
In January, PXP Corp, a solar startup, began test-driving a solar car with much cheaper
modules. The company was founded in 2020 by a former executive of Solar Frontier,
an Idemitsu Kosan affiliate that pioneered the CIGS (copper, indium, gallium,
selenium) module development.

Solar Frontier researchers joined PXP after Idemitsu terminated its CIGS business,
attributing it to a lack of market potential. For commercial reasons, PXP dubbed its
CIGS products as “chalcopyrite”.

The PXP team installed 332 stamp-sized CIGS modules on the roof of an i-MiEV, a
Mitsubishi EV model. The precise module cost data was not available, but Japan NRG
estimates that the module to cost less than ¥200,000 based on market data. The
module recorded power conversion efficiency of 18% when driving in the city of
Sagamihara close to Tokyo. The module power output was 360 W, allowing travel for
16 km.


A company official said that less
than five grams each of copper,
indium, selenium and gallium
powders were needed to form a
50-microns-thick-layer with an area
of 2 sq meters. The CIGS layer was
put on a thin titanium sheet. The
module’s total weight was 1 kg.
PXP plans an upgrade to achieve a
power efficiency of 45% in about
two years. Last year, they built a
pilot CIGS module plant to make
modules for more tests.

Module performance needs to
improve
An EV from the automaker Nissan,
the model Leaf, travels over 400
km on a single charge. Sharp’s car,
which travels 50 km, and PXP’s
vehicle, with its 16 km range, are

14

far behind in terms of this performance. But the latter are showcasing one direction in
which EVs can evolve.

As there is a limit to the number of solar modules a car can hold, each module’s
output needs to increase by multiple times. And yet, elements have theoretical power
efficiency limits. Hence, the current R&D is focused on a stacking approach: putting
several power-generating devices on top of one other to form a “tandem module”.

Tandem modules, however, must be light and thin if they are to survive on the top of
a passenger vehicle. After all, extra weight reduces vehicle performance. So, what
might be the solutions here?

PXP and others see potential in combining CIGS with perovskite solar cells (PSC) – 1
micron thick, bendable devices made of perovskite crystal layers. Both PSC and CIGS
could be made using sputtering equipment, which sprays nano-sized powder on a
substrate in a vacuum container. Using the same production method cuts costs. The
PSC-CIGS tandem module could, theoretically, achieve a 45% power efficiency or
higher.

Struggles against heat
Life would be easier if modules produced only power. But recent module field studies
showed that super-thin modules also release heat that would affect storage battery
performance and safety. Silicon module temperatures rise up to 90°C, and thin film
modules could take this even higher.

According to one perovskite researcher at a separate company, a postcard-sized
module recorded temperatures rising to “alarming levels” in a summer trial last year.
The module’s energy efficiency was 10-15% and the rest of its energy possibly
manifested itself as heat, according to his theory. This is critical since heat would not
only affect the material that’s in contact with the module, it could destroy the module
itself, he said.


Other perovskite researchers contend that the modules are not heat-emitting devices;
there is no room to absorb or release heat as the modules are so thin. But heat control
remains a challenge should these modules end up being installed on a car. Even
without solar modules, temperatures on a car bonnet and roof tend to surge to
unbearable levels on a sunny summer’s day. For the modules, this would be even
worse due to their black or dark coloring, which absorbs heat.

One solution is to put the modules on heat-insulating sheets made of chlorinated
polyvinyl chloride or other materials, which are used for some of the lithium-ion
battery packs to block heat. But these degrade over time and need regular replacing.
The degradation speeds up if temperatures rise above 80°C.

A need for incentives
Various breakthroughs are needed to make solar cars a reality. Are there incentives to
make them happen? The engineers at PXP are excited because they believe in their
mission to create unprecedented value for society. Cynics, however, point to the slow
takeoff of EV sales in Japan.


15

If a normal EV is not yet whetting consumer appetite, what demand is there for a
“solar car”, which offers much lower range performance, among other issues? Even
engineers at Sharp, with its world’s best-performing solar module, believe that a
hybrid vehicle that has both a solar and other power sources, would have better
marketing potential.

The gaps between expectation and reality defeats some people, while others use it as
inspiration. Correctly assessing the gaps is perhaps the first important step.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
Hydrogen Fueling Homes – a New World of Residential Energy Services

Hydrogen’s role in decarbonizing homes has so far proved contentious. It was tested
as a fuel for home heating in the UK, with experiments also held in Sweden, the U.S.
and elsewhere. Opposition to the trials from various independent regulators and
experts has meant that widespread usage of hydrogen in homes is, for now, unlikely.

In Japan, which is among the most bullish countries for hydrogen energy usage, there
is an appetite to make hydrogen work as a decarbonization pathway for homes, even
if the approach differs from most countries.

Homes contribute to about 15% of Japan’s carbon footprint and the country has a
modern gas infrastructure that took decades to complete. Equally, the government is
keen to promote examples of hydrogen for ordinary citizens in order to help build
wider support for the clean-burning fuel as a future alternative to fossil fuels.

And so, in January, the doors opened on Japan’s first “hydrogen town”. A central
Tokyo district is playing host to an experiment of using hydrogen to power communal
facilities and transport, with families already moving in. Meanwhile, other lifestyle
applications of hydrogen are tested elsewhere in Japan, hoping to demonstrate that
the gas that’s lighter than air can support ground-level needs.


Harumi Flag project
The land that formerly housed athletes during the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020 (held
in 2021), is now the site of a “hydrogen town”. On January 19, families started to
move into the Harumi Flag “hydrogen town”, a 18-hectare residential-commercial
complex built on the site of the former Olympic Village in Tokyo.

After the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games (held in 2021), the Tokyo Metropolitan
Government (TMG) decided to sell the property in the Harumi district of Chuo City to
11 private developers. These include Mitsui Fudosan, Tokyu Land Corp, Sumitomo
Corp, and Tokyo Tatemono.

The district was reborn as an urban community with 24 high-rise condominiums and
malls, but developers also promised to promote the project as a smart town. And so
the idea of testing the potential application of hydrogen in a community took root.

Some 12,000 people are expected to live in the 5,362 apartments built over the 13
hectare residential area. Each has an Ene-Farm fuel cell system that’s connected to
storage batteries, and hydrogen gas flows to the buildings via pipelines. Ene-Farm is a
two square meter system that generates electricity through a chemical reaction
between oxygen in the air and hydrogen from city gas services.

Heat, produced as a byproduct of power, can be used for home heating. Since the
electricity is generated and used right from the home, there’s no loss from grid
transmission.


17

Panasonic manufactures the Ene-Farm systems, which were developed by Tokyo Gas,
Osaka Gas and ENEOS. Panasonic says users can cut around ¥50,000-¥60,000 from
annual utility bills, and CO2 emissions by about 1.5 tons / year.

In March, Tokyo Gas is expected to begin piping hydrogen supplies to the area.
Pipelines will carry hydrogen to buildings to fuel generators that will then supply
electricity to shared facilities.

Meanwhile, ENEOS will open local hydrogen service stations to offer H2 for transport.
Fuel cell vehicles will be available via car sharing schemes for local residents. ENEOS
will likely get the hydrogen from Tokyo Gas.

Given the experimental nature of the district, the pricing of apartments (which range
between 50 to 120 square meters) is slightly below central Tokyo rates. The Harumi
Flag developments cost ¥58 million to ¥96 million each. The average price of new
condominiums built last year in central Tokyo topped ¥100 million for the first time.
Nearly 2,700 flats have been sold. Some are only now on sale and other condos are
still under construction. All 5,632 flats will be completed by the end of the year.

The unbearable lightness of H2
New residents can expect a steep monthly management fee of as much as ¥68,000.
While this fee includes a plethora of amenities (internet, television subscriptions,
building and street maintenance fees, etc), there’s no line item for hydrogen because
the government is keen to keep the cost of the local hydrogen economy away from
the public eye, according to an ENEOS official.


“The properties are privately owned, but the Tokyo government has had a large
influence since it started the project,” the official said, adding that the developers are
making hydrogen costs invisible.

“For fuel cell vehicles, [inside the district] hydrogen is sold at around ¥100 / nm3, the
government recommended price. This is a level equivalent to gasoline prices. Other
hydrogen supplies will be offered below the ¥100 / nm2 threshold. Harumi Flag
residents are getting a real bargain,” he added.

The cost of hydrogen for ENEOS and other companies in the project will be in red.
“There will be financial losses, but this is an investment for the future,” the official
said. The companies are also limiting the pipeline hydrogen supply to building power
systems during night hours, and the systems will generate power for shared facilities,
not to the individual flats.

At this level of consumption, the hydrogen cost can be recovered from the monthly
management fee. “It is so small that it cannot be itemized,” said the official.

Last-mile H2 delivery
Hydrogen is being tested in other residential settings around Japan. There are hotels
with hydrogen-fueled boilers installed in Kawasaki City and Namie Township
(Fukushima Pref), and a hotel with a hydrogen-fueled kitchen system in Hakone
Township (Kanagawa Pref).


18

In Minamisoma City (Fukushima Pref), Iwatani Corp and Soma Gas group plan a field
study for delivering propane gas mixed with hydrogen through city gas pipelines.
Transmission will start by January 2025 and continue to March 2026.

Unlike the Harumi Flag project, Minamisoma is deeply rural. Rice growing is the main
income source for the 53,000 people in the city. Just 80 homes will participate in this
study.

In contrast to Harumi Flag’s new buildings and smart systems, the Minamisoma study
will utilize legacy systems, such as propane gas pipelines to transport hydrogen-
propane gas. Homes will continue to use their kitchen ovens and heating systems.

One of the study’s main purposes is to identify the optimal ratio of hydrogen to
propane that can be supported by legacy infrastructure, which uses pipes made of
SUS316-grade nickel-chrome-molybdenum stainless steel. This is the same steel
quality that’s used for hydrogen pipelines.

Conclusion
Hydrogen projects are burgeoning nationwide on the back of the national
government’s plans to create a real hydrogen economy. With eight hydrogen and
ammonia hubs set to be created, they should accelerate the use of these fuels in
industrial zones clustered around the fuel import terminals.

But many are wondering if hydrogen can also be applied outside of heavy industry
and the so-called hard-to-abate sectors. This will involve trialing its use in more
residential and commercial settings, which is sure to bring up a different set of
challenges.

Unlike plans to develop hydrogen demand among industrial users through regulation,
carbon pricing, subsidies and tax breaks, the residential hydrogen economy will likely
be driven by a desire to improve living standards or the climate etc., rather than profit
alone.


The urban Harumi Flag and the rural Minamisoma projects will provide an interesting
study on whether regular citizens will learn to value the hydrogen way.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

China / Renewable energy
In 2023, the country’s net installed solar capacity grew by over 50% YoY, reaching 609
GW, according to the National Energy Administration. It said that China’s solar
capacity rose by over 215 GW – 25% of which came online in December 2023 alone.

India / Coal power
A total of 19 coal-based units across 10 power plants, with a total capacity of 2.34
GW, were retired from 2021 to January 2024. Nearly all are in the northeast regions of
Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, etc.

India / Natural gas
Natural gas consumption in India will more than triple by 2050, says the U.S. Energy
Information Agency, with annual growth of 4.4% over that period. This is more than
twice the 2% annual rate in China, the next-fastest-growing country. Ammonia
production, as well as a growing oil refining sector, will drive most of India’s growth in
natural gas consumption.

India / Solar power
Adani Green Energy began operations of 551 MW capacity of the world’s largest
renewable energy park, located in Gujarat. By 2030, the project is targeted to have a
total of 30 GW of renewable energy capacity.

LNG
In 2023, roughly 67% of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe, and 26% went to Asia,
according to LSEG data. The Biden administration has a pause on pending and future
permits to export LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries until the Dept of
Energy finishes a new review of climate impacts.

Nuclear power
In 2022, global nuclear production declined 4% YoY, to reach 2,546 TWh of electricity,
the steepest decline in a decade, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status
Report. Outside of China, which is the world’s second largest nuclear producer,
nuclear energy production fell by 5%, reaching a “level last seen in the mid-1990s.

Oil markets
An effort to restore depleted oil stocks — notably in China, the U.S. and Europe —
could boost demand and prices in coming months. Morgan Stanley raised its quarterly
outlook for Brent crude to an average of $82.50 / barrel in Q1 and Q2 – compared
with $80 and $77.50, previously. A tight oil market is now expected this year.

Philippines / Renewable energy
In August, the Dept of Energy will conduct the third round of the Green Energy
Auction for hydropower and geothermal projects (total capacity 4.4 GW). The project
is intended for non-Feed-In-Tariff eligible technologies, such as geothermal and
pumped-storage hydro.

Singapore / IEA
The IEA will set up a regional cooperation center in Singapore, the first office outside
its headquarters in Paris. The regional IEA office will work with all countries in
Southeast Asia, and beyond, to improve energy security and energy transition.

Uzbekistan / Hydro power
The state hydro power company, Uzbekhydroenergo, issued a tender to develop five
new hydropower plants (total capacity of 47 MW). This is in response to the country’s
growing demand for electricity and clean energy commitments.
