NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





METI updates subsea mining and development plan, CCS added to its scope

(Government statement, March 22)
•  METI has updated the Ocean Energy and Mineral Resource Development Plan.
•  Highlights:
o  Conduct trial phase subsea mining of shallow type and pore-filling type methane
hydrates by FY2030.
o  By 2028, conduct 3D sea bottom oil and gas exploration over 50,000 m2.
o  Identify areas that have potential as CCS sites, and establish systems and frameworks to

allow commercial CCS services by 2030.
o  Explore and assess the potential of submarine hydrothermal deposits.
o  Explore and quantify cobalt-rich crust resources at 800-2,400 meters below sea level in
the EEZ and in the waters managed by the International Seabed Authority (ISA);
contribute to international rule making on the subsea cobalt resource development.
o  Quantify manganese nodule deposits in international waters 4,000-6,000 meters below
sea level that’s managed by the ISA; test mining equipment and conduct preliminary

studies to brace for environmental impact assessment.
o  Develop technologies to mine rare earths at 6,000 meters below sea level, to be
implemented in the waters around Minami Torishima Island; develop rare earth refining
and production processes.
o  CONTEXT: The plan falls under the Basic Ocean Strategy Act which was legislated in
2007. CCS was added to its scope for the first time.
• TAKEAWAY: This is an ambitious plan and

speed is important as Japan has exclusive
mining rights agreed with the ISA until
2029 for cobalt crusts and 2026 for
manganese nodules. On rare earth supply
chain development, the plan calls for
testing a complete production process,

from soil retrieval on the seabed to
refining in waters around Minami
Torishima Island.

METI to launch information sharing system for European battery rules
(Denki Shimbun, March 21)
•  In April, METI will launch Ouranos Ecosystem, an information sharing platform for businesses; its
goal is to prepare for the implementation of the European Batteries Regulation (ERB) that takes

effect in 2025.
•  CONTEXT: The ERB will require disclosure of emissions over an entire life cycle. The data will be
used for marketing EVs in Europe. The first data to be collected is the GHG of storage batteries.
The regulation will initially cover EVs, but will expand to include industrial storage batteries.
•  About 80 firms, mostly automakers, are expected to join the platform. Since violating the battery
regulation could result in a ban on sales in Europe, METI estimates that 200 firms will join the
system for storage battery-related products alone.




Japan to change J-Credit framework to bolster liquidity and price setting mechanisms
(Government statement, March 15)
•  METI and other ministries involved with J-Credit carbon offsets will change how the credits are

released to market participants in order to raise liquidity and strengthen price setting mechanisms.
•  So far, the credits had been offered via bids at auctions held twice a year. Buyers were selected
based on price alone.
•  From February, the govt started to sell govt-held J-credits to “market makers” whose task is to
boost the liquidity by conducting a certain amount of transactions in a given period.
•  In addition, credit sales will now be done not only based on price but also market supply volume,
trading framework, etc. Independent experts will monitor the process.

•  CONTEXT: A recent trial run of the “market maker system” run by the Tokyo Stock Exchange
resulted in increased liquidity. The exchange selected Sumitomo Corp, Daiwa Securities, Mizuho
Bank, Marubeni and Mitsui & Co.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT
Tokyo exchange awards Sumitomo, Mizuho Bank as best carbon market makers
(TSE statement, March 19)
o  The Tokyo Stock Exchange has awarded Sumitomo Corp and Mizuho Bank as the best

market makers of J-Credit carbon offset credits, recognizing them for boosting trading
liquidity over Nov to Feb this year.
o  Key participants in the J-Credit trades were named as “market makers”, required to
perform a certain transaction volume in a given period to raise liquidity.
o  Daiwa Securities was given the “good market maker” award.
o  During the Nov to Feb period, trades of J-Credits in the energy saving category

increased 2.4 times, and renewable energy credits 6.1 times.



Renewable projects in Vietnam and Tunisia awarded JCM credits

(Government statement, March 22)
•  Nine renewable projects in Vietnam and Tunisia were awarded carbon offset credits under the
Joint Crediting Mechanism in the 4th round of project reviews for FY2023.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The credits ranged from 393 to 83,118 tons of CO2 equivalent. The latter were awarded to a 50
MW erex biomass power project in Vietnam.
•  A green hydrogen project in Mongolia, to be run by the Overseas Environment Cooperation
Center, Japan, will receive govt funding and will possibly be granted JCM credits. The project is to
install wind turbines to generate green hydrogen that will be used as boiler fuel.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Govt reports errors in J-Credit project data book
(Government statement, March 18)
o  Errors were made in J-Credit GHG emissions inventory data for five projects. This likely
occurred when entering the renewable power output in the application form. Corrections
were made by March 17.
o  Since the ownership of the credits associated with these projects has not changed, they

were unlikely to have been traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.



Tokyo govt to disclose Perovskite field study analysis results

(Japan NRG, March 21)
•  In June, the Tokyo metropolitan govt (TMG) plans to disclose results of Perovskite solar cell (PSC)
field studies. The parties are discussing the scope of the disclosures, a TMG official told Japan
NRG.
•  The year-long studies tested the performance of PSC-equipped air monitoring sensors installed in
TMG offices. They’ll be completed on May 31. Macnica provided the sensors and EneCoat
Technologies the PSC modules.
•  Power generation efficiencies during different times of the day, and the module endurance data,

are likely to be shared with the public.
•  CONTEXT: The TMG is testing indoor PSC-equipped devices with Macnica and EneCoat. It is also
testing outdoor PSC applications at its water treatment facility, using Sekisui Chemical modules.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT
Ricoh Group launches indoor Perovskite field studies
(Company statement, March 15)
o  Ricoh Group launched field studies of air sensors equipped with Perovskite solar cell

(PSC) modules at TMG facilities; it will run to April 2025.
o  Five sensors were installed at the TMG building observatory that’s open to the public.
Temperature, humidity, illuminance and carbon intensity data collected by the sensors
will be transmitted to a display panel.
o  Five more sensors will be installed at a condo for senior citizens.
• TAKEAWAY: Ricoh declined to give details on its sensors, including

power efficiencies. But, in theory, the Ricoh studies are more advanced
than Macnica/EneCoat which used a device with a backup lithium-ion
battery to run in the absence of light. The Ricoh device will run solely on
PSC modules, and it has more functions. In addition to collecting data
24/7, it sends the data to a display device. It would be a breakthrough if
stand-alone data collection and transmission could be realized using just

the PSC modules, since data transmission is power intensive.

MoE rewrites carbon offset principles and guidelines
(Government statement, March 22)
•  The MoE has revised its guiding principles for carbon offset programs, clarifying that carbon
capture is not removal and does not qualify to be an offset method.
•  The revised guidelines described the procedures required in order to claim that the carbon

footprint of a products or service has been offset.
•  CONTEXT: METI plans to introduce a new “GX Value Index” where companies are able to claim
“reduced emissions” of products and services, and label them. An interim report proposing the
new index was released last week. A seamless integration of MoE and METI systems will be
needed.




Takasago develops electrolyzer for hydrogen production on the Moon
(Company statement, March 18)
•  Takasago Thermal Engineering has developed an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen and oxygen
from water on the Moon. Tokyo-based “ispace Inc” will transport the system to the Moon by late

FY2024.
•  The water feedstock will be shipped to the Moon; energy will be sourced from a solar system
installed on the lunar lander.
•  This will be the world’s first attempt at electrolysis on the Moon. The device is 300 mm x 450 mm x
200 mm; capacity is “very small”.
•  CONTEXT: The Moon might hold water deposits, and over 30 businesses in Japan are exploring
the sourcing of hydrogen there; as well as building a hydrogen plant and a “lunar smart

community” of on-site plant engineers.
• TAKEAWAY: The Moon’s temperatures swing from minus 170°C to 200°C. The electrolyzer components are
made of specialty steel that could withstand temperatures above 200°C, but might be vulnerable to 300°C
fluctuations. Thus, the steel used in the components may stretch, and the development of a special steel with
strong stretch resistance may be needed, a researcher told Japan NRG.




Tokyo Gas, Mitsubishi, etc form group to promote e-methane

(Company statement, March 19)
•  Tokyo Gas and seven other companies formed a group dedicated to ‘electric’ natural gas (e-NG),
better known in Japan as e-methane. They’ll promote the use of e-NG, a synthetic methane made
from blending ‘renewable’ hydrogen and CO2.
•  Other companies in this group include Engie, Mitsubishi, Osaka Gas, Sempra, and Toho Gas.
•  e-NG / e-methane has the same molecular composition as natural gas, and can be transported and

stored using existing infrastructure.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Tokyo Gas sets up company to develop e-methane business in U.S.
(Company statement, March 19)
o  Tokyo Gas set up Tokyo Gas GX1 that’s wholly-owned by Tokyo Gas America.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  TGX1 will develop an e-methane business, creating overseas supply chains for e-methane
in SE Asia, the Middle East, and Australia.
o  By 2030, Tokyo Gas plans that e-methane will equal 1% of its total gas sales.




Tokyo Gas and Mitsui ink deal to import 40,000 m3 of biomethane from U.S.
(Company statement, March 22)
•  Tokyo Gas and Mitsui & Co will import 40,000 m3 of biomethane from the U.S. Derived from
landfill biogas, it has the same methane concentration as natural gas.
•  In Japan it will be consumed in existing LNG and city gas infrastructure. Tokyo Gas and Mitsui will

collaborate further to build a biomethane international supply chain.
•  CONTEXT: Biomethane is a way to reduce GHG emissions by utilizing organic methane from
waste. Under Japanese regulations, CO2 emissions from biomass fuels are excluded from GHG
calculations.




MOL, Idemitsu Kosan ink MoU on e-fuel and synthetic methanol supply chain
(Company statement, March 19)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Idemitsu Kosan, and HIF USA and HIF Asia Pacific inked an MoU to develop a
synthetic fuel (e-fuel) / synthetic methanol (e-methanol) supply chain, including the marine
transport of CO2.
•  These synthetic fuels are produced by synthesizing hydrogen made with the help of renewable

energy sources and CO2. The partners will focus on feasibility studies for CO2 marine transport
from Japan to HIF's overseas production plants.
•  CONTEXT: Methanol is used as base materials in plastic, synthetic fabrics to make clothing,
construction materials, and as a chemical agent in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. "Its endless
myriad applications have made methanol ubiquitous in our lives and throughout society,"
according to Mitsubishi.




Fukushima businesses form FCV service station advocacy group
(Fukushima Minyu Shimbun, March 19)
•  Local businesses and municipalities in Fukushima prefecture formed an advocacy group for
hydrogen fuel cell vehicle service stations.
•  There are four stationary and one mobile FCV service stations for 446 FCVs in the prefecture. To

address high running costs and other challenges, the group will write policy recommendations and
engage with state authorities.
•  Founding members include four service station operators, the municipalities of the FC service
station sites, Toyota Motor, Obayashi Corp, etc.
•  CONTEXT: FCV and EV service stations come and go because in the last six months FCV sales
accounted for less than 0.1% of total passenger car sales, and EVs 1-2%. There are about 160 FCV

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

service stations nationwide, and the govt’s goal is to hit 320 next year. To compare, there are over
20,000 EV charging stands but about 100 close every month.
• TAKEAWAY: This is Japan’s first cross-sector advocacy group for FCV service stations, lagging behind EV
interest groups that have been active for over 10 years. There are prefectures, such as Iwate, which do not yet
have any FCV service stations. The Fukushima group will need to look beyond regional issues to have an

impact.




Tsubame BHB on track with low pressure, low temperature ammonia production
(Nikkei, March 21)
•  Nakamura Koji, CEO of Tsubame BHB, said global ammonia demand will increase 2.2-fold by 2050
to 480 mln tons.
•  Global population increase and demand for ship fuel will propel growth. Green ammonia will see
the fastest growth on the back of the energy transition. However, ammonia supply sources are

concentrated in Europe, the U.S. and China.
•  The BHB ammonia production processes are for small volumes in low temperature and pressure
environments, with a lower carbon footprint. INPEX will launch a 500 tons / year plant using BHB
technology in 2025.




JX and Chevron New Energies sign MoU on CCS value chain
(Company statement, March 19)
•  JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration (JX) and Chevron New Energies signed an MoU to collaborate on
developing a CCS value chain.
•  The MoU aims to test the feasibility of capturing CO2 emissions from industries. They intend to
transport it to Chevron's CCS projects in Australia, and to explore transboundary policies and

potential CO2 storage sites in Asia-Pacific.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JX, NYK and KNCC ink MoU on CO2 liquefaction and storage optimization
(Company statement, March 21)
o  JX, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, and Knutsen NYK Carbon Carriers (KNCC) inked an
MoU on CO2 liquefaction and storage. KNCC's cargo tank cylinders will be able to store

and transport liquefied CO2 at higher temperatures and pressures.
o  The goal is to address challenges in the CCUS value chain. They include capital
investment, energy consumption, and environmental impact. They plan to conduct
verification by 2024 using KNCC's demo facility in Norway.

JRE-Iberdrola-Tohoku Electric consortium wins Happo-Noshiro offshore wind project

(Japan NRG, March 22)
•  The govt chose a consortium comprising JRE, Iberdrola Renewables and Tohoku Electric as
operator of the fourth and final wind power generation project of the Round 2 auction.
•  The 375 MW wind farm will sit off the coast of Happo-Noshiro (Akita Pref) north Japan.
•  The facility is scheduled to begin commercial operation in June 2029. With a price set at ¥3/ kWh,
it will use a bottom-fixed type foundation and 25 units of 15 MW wind turbines from Danish maker
Vestas.
•  The other bidders were two consortiums: one comprising JERA, trading house Itochu and J-Power;

another one comprising TEPCO Renewable Power, Sumitomo and two construction firms Kato
Construction and Norshiro-based Narita Construction.
•  CONTEXT: The capacity auctioned in Round 2 totals 1.8 GW across four projects. The Happo-
Noshiro tender result announcement came a couple of months after those for the other three
projects in the round. METI and MLIT’s decision regarding the winning bid was delayed as the
timing of the use of a port overlapped with another Akita project.

•  Japan has set targets for 10 GW of offshore wind by 2030, and up to 45 GW by 2040.
• TAKEAWAY: Iberdrola’s win follows that of RWE’s in December 2023, making it the second non-Japanese
energy company selected to develop wind farms in the country, albeit in partnership with Japanese firms.
Project feasibility, particularly the timing of the launch of commercial operation, as well as sufficient measures
to protect the environment / biodiversity, and impact on the local communities, were decisive factors for the
winning bid in all Round 2 projects.

Those with 250 kW or more of FIP-qualified projects will be eligible. Roof-mounted projects will be
exempted. FY2024 will have four auctions, with maximum per kWh rates of ¥9.20, ¥9.13, ¥9.05,
and ¥8.98, respectively.
•  The purchase price for onshore wind projects of 50 kW or more will be determined through an
auction. During FY2024, there will be just one auction round with a cap on the price of ¥14.
However, if offered capacity exceeds 1.3 GW, the govt will hold additional auctions during the

year; the max price will be the higher of the weighted average bid for the same year, or ¥13.
•  CONTEXT: Purchase prices for renewables are set by the METI minister every fiscal year before the
start of the next one, and are based on costs normally required for efficient supply of renewables-
derived electricity with appropriate profit margins.

ANRE to optimize bidding strategy with simultaneous JEPX spot and balancing markets
(Denki Shimbun, March 19)
•  ANRE proposed a bidding system in which electricity supply (spot market) and adjustment
(balancing, also known as the supply-demand adjustment market) are simultaneously contracted.
•  Discussions focused on the need to introduce a power supply activation and output allocation

system responsible for execution of contracts. The implementation cost has been estimated at
¥81-¥87.5 billion.
•  The proposal was based on the British nodal scheme adopted in 2022 under which prices are
determined on a node-by-node basis, taking into account grid congestion.
•  ANRE might set three types of necessary parameters: a power supply startup and output allocation
system, a price calculation system, and a system for operators.

•  They also proposed a system that would allow power generators to choose between self-
scheduled and pool-scheduled resources, a format similar to that of American grid operator and
wholesale market administrator PJM Interconnection.



EGC’s meeting on market status and monitoring draws calls for rate reform

(Denki Shimbun, March 19)
•  The EGC met on March 18 to hear opinions from experts on the monitoring scheme for full
deregulation of electric power retailing and the state of the wholesale power market, as part of
efforts to formulate an organizational policy to be finalized in June.
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan (FEPC) proposed a review of the calculation
formula and examination period for state-set electricity tariffs. FEPC director Sasaki Hideaki said

that regulated tariffs were lower than market rates, which distorts the competitive environment.
•  The meeting also drew calls for a reform of the wholesale electricity market, with some saying it
has “become increasingly complex.”
•  Securing qualified human resources for the monitoring of the market is also a pressing issue.

LNG export freeze to be lifted within a year, says U.S. Sec of Energy
(Nikkei, March 18)
•  U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm indicated that the freeze on new LNG export permits

will be lifted within a year.
•  CONTEXT: The Biden admin announced the freeze in January. The aim was to assess the impact of
LNG production on global warming, but this caused concerns from major customers such as Japan
and Europe.
• TAKEAWAY: The pause intended to affect pending and future applications for LNG export projects. The
measure does not impact already approved business. Still, some Japanese companies have offtake contracts

for future LNG projects in the U.S. Japanese concerns reflect persistent dependency on LNG despite the boost
of renewables and nuclear power. Japan is the world’s second largest importer of LNG.




Oil stockpile study group proposes sale of excess national reserve
(Government statement, March 15)
•  The ANRE study group for oil stockpiles released an interim report that included a proposal to trim
the national reserve by selling excess oil above the amount required by law, which is equivalent to
138 consumption days.
•  As nationwide oil demand is falling, excess storage space will appear at the 10 national stockpile

facilities. That space could be used to store ammonia, hydrogen and other carbon neutral fuels.
•  The report said oil demand is declining on the back of the energy transition, but it’s also important
to maintain its stockpiling due to geopolitical uncertainties.




LNG stocks held by power utilities down 6.4% from last week to October levels

ANALYSIS

BY JAPAN NRG TEAM
Exclusive Interview: Sean Kidney, CEO of the Climate Bonds Initiative

The Climate Bonds Initiative (Climate Bonds), is an international NGO that seeks to
“mobilize global capital for climate action”. What that means in practice is 1)
Reporting on the evolution of the global market for green bonds; 2) Producing
standards and certification schemes for bonds that raise funds for investments in the
low-carbon economy; and 3) Developing policy proposals for governments, finance,
and industry.

Most recently, Climate Bonds came to prominence in Japan as the certifying authority
for the Japanese government’s first issuance of “Climate Transition Bonds” (also
known as GX Bonds). The framework applied to the GX Bond is said to be a world-
first. And while some are skeptical about the Japanese government’s efforts, Sean
Kidney, the CEO of the Climate Bonds Initiative, sat down with Japan NRG in Tokyo
to explain why he believes in the GX issuance.


There was a lot of caution and skepticism about the Japanese government creating a
new kind of bond, as opposed to a “green bond”. Is the GX Bond entirely new? And
if so, is it still valid to address climate change?

To be very clear, this is a climate transition bond to finance Japan's green
transformation program (GX). It's a green bond, it walks and talks and smells like a
green bond. It goes in a green bond portfolio, there’s no difference. Except that the
nature of the investments it’s focused on is how to support an industrial transition. It’s
industrial planning.

We haven't seen industrial planning bonds before. That's useful. And we think it's a
significant and important development for the market. But it's still a green bond. It's a
subset. It's not a new class. In the sense that, green bonds are about addressing
climate from [the standpoint of the International Energy Agency’s] 1.5°C framework.
And that's what this bond does. It’s just that it talks about how we transition things as
part of that process.

Congratulations to the Japanese government for tailoring their program to meet our
public criteria. We just have a global program of developing status work that meets a
1.5°C trajectory for the purpose of finance. They applied. And it worked.

What was the investor interest like? The bond was three times over-subscribed, but
the media coverage around it was at best luke-warm.


From the ministry of finance’s point of view, getting the bond out there is an
icebreaker, rather than an endgame. They're socializing the idea and socializing the
effect. Japanese bonds are generally oversubscribed. So, the oversubscription rate for
GX bonds was in line with other Japanese bonds that were being done. However,
government did get a price benefit with a GX bond - a modest price benefit but
significant given how tight Japanese bonds are. But this is because investors are
getting a better valuation from secondary market pricing, so a tighter price at primary
18



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

is still good value. The government got a 0.7% rate on the first one and 1.5% on the
second one. That's a good indicator of demand.

Did the bond sale generate any interest with overseas investors?

We don’t have access to that information (yet), but I would assume that by far the
majority of the buyers were local, because they are yen bonds. Not a lot of
international investors have yen exposure, but I believe they still got a good uptick of
international participation. The Bank of Japan would have been the largest purchaser
of the bonds, as it normally is [with state-backed bonds].

My hunch is that it probably got somewhere between 2% and 5% from the
international investors. We’ve got a long way to go, but I'd like to see it get to 25%.
Because, it’s about big international investors having confidence in the Japanese
energy transformation plan.

Do international investors understand what the Japanese GX plan is about?


I'd say there's growing awareness, there's interest. The other thing about the green
bond market is there's a lot of unquenched demand, so they've got to place the
money. Reticence at first will quickly evaporate, as they get a little confidence. And I
do expect to see the share of overseas investor interest grow for future GX bonds for
that reason, as long as the government maintains globally consistent environmental
credentials.

A lot of bond funds have a mandate to address climate change, although the bulk of
investor demand comes from mainstream bonds looking to green a portion of their
portfolio. It's someone who has a corporate or an organizational focus on addressing
the climate crisis and might have to shift 20% of their portfolio to green. They're more
often looking at the underlying investments than they are at the labeling.

But even for those that are restricted to investing in green bonds, if they explain to
their clients what a GX bond is, it works. I know this from speaking to a lot of fund
managers. Having said that, clearly, people are saying, What the hell is this? The first
question I get from investors is, so what about coal and ammonia?’ That's the
overriding concern as a result of confusing media coverage last year. But it's not the
case.

Let’s clear this one up. METI says the use of ammonia as a fuel for power plants,
including the option to burn both coal and ammonia in a power plant (co-firing), are
part of the GX program. But you say it is not part of the GX Bond financing scope.

The GX bond is creating funding for government programs, which in this case includes
financial support for Research & Development into the utilization of hydrogen and
ammonia. Fantastic. We're very supportive. But, at least in these first two bond
issuances, there is no allocation for operational assets in ammonia or hydrogen, or
coal-fired plants or any of these areas at this stage. It’s necessary R&D.

METI got a lot of bad press last year about their ammonia co-firing, which was
misleading, because that's only a small slice of what they're talking about [with the GX

19

program]. It's like the IRA in the U.S., which gets a lot of good press now, but you
know what, there are boondoggles for the gas industry in there.

There’s stuff in the GX program, that I would argue, they are going to have to leave
out as time goes on. But there's so much stuff that's really good. And, for the purpose
of the bond, they trimmed it. They actually took out the controversial stuff, which we
couldn't cover, such as natural gas or anything operational for replacing coal or
ammonia.

Would you be open to ammonia or hydrogen projects being included in GX Bonds?

We've been very clear that we're going to need a lot of rollout of hydrogen, ammonia,
amongst other things going forward. We've published clear criteria for inclusion,
including things like emission levels. We’re saying, this is a transition sector, it's got to
get very low carbon by the time we get to 2050. You can't do that with gray or black
hydrogen, they have got to be frozen out. But, blue – yes, for a while. The difficulty
with blue is emissions leakage in the gas supply chain. And we've got criteria for those
as well.

The problem is when we're mixing [ammonia or hydrogen], like with coal. We've still
got to be aligned with the IEA net zero pathway. So, our concern, and we said this in a
paper we published in October 2023, is that the current thinking in the public
statements by JERA – of applying ammonia fuel to coal power plants – is that it looks
like they're still going to burn coal in the 2040s (part of it mixed with ammonia). But,
you know, coal usage has to be shut down sooner. The 2040s are too far away.


We’re saying, “tell us how what you're doing meets the 1.5°C pathway”. The global
reference document is the IEA Net Zero Roadmap, which has a very accelerated
closeout for coal. If it can be shown that using the ammonia/coal plan meets that
roadmap, we're happy. And it’s possible that ammonia replacing some of the coal will
help. But it’s a stretch goal. So, we might need to find another pathway for JERA.

But we’re very happy to support R&D. We need to change things very, very quickly, so
we need to invest in a lot of R&D solutions. On the R&D that’s happening with
ammonia combustion, my question is: Can [the shift from coal to ammonia] happen
sooner than 2050. Could they do it in a way that could change those complexities
sooner, and what are the barriers?

JERA argues that the speed of the transition also hinges on the speedy rollout of
affordable hydrogen and ammonia supply, which is outside of their control.

I'm very optimistic about that. We now have price points that are revolutionary. In the
U.S., the $1 per kilo price point for commercial use will be achieved by the new
hydrogen plants that are coming through, with the IRA subsidy making up the
difference. In Spain, green hydrogen is being delivered to ArcelorMittal at €1.50 a kilo
already. In India, Adani [Group] claims they're going to be able to deliver hydrogen at
97 cents a kilo in three years to industry in Gujarat province. You can't trust a single
source, but if you see three different sources moving along quite fast, you think:
something's going on. This is looking possible.


20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

So, nothing is certain here. But, at minimum, we expect people to commit to [a
transition away from coal by] 2035, which is essentially setting market signals to
suppliers.

ENERGY TRANSITION

You seem confident about the move to a hydrogen economy. Aside from power
companies, which industries do you expect to embrace hydrogen / ammonia first?

I'm uncertain which demand domino will be pushed over first. I think it's autos,
because there's this amazing arbitrage in the auto industry. If you buy green steel
now, it’s about 40% more costly per kilo than ordinary steel. It's quite high, right?
However, this is only 1% of the retail cost of the car! Could Toyota put out a contract
saying they want JFE and Nippon Steel to change their steelmaking by 2028? That
would push steelmaking over the line.

Japanese steelmakers are already reconsidering their blast furnaces. About 75% of all
blast furnaces in Japan are coming to the end of their operating life. What are they
going to do if they're going to get a green steel contract? My view is: it will be electric
arc furnaces here in Japan and bringing in green semi-finished steel products from
hydrogen-fuelled blast furnaces in countries that have large renewable energy
resources.

We have multiple sources of demand that could be drivers for hydrogen; steel is just
one of those. The catalyst could be fertilizer, because of the international fertilizer
push to sustainability.


Nuclear power is a big part of Japan’s GX program. What are your views on this?

The GX bond allows for R&D funding for nuclear energy. It doesn't have operational
investments for nuclear. We would not have been able to certify investments for
operational nuclear; not because we’re against it, we just don’t have the criteria.

We haven't set it as a priority, because at the end of the day it’s going to be
governments funding new nuclear, wherever you are since, Governments will have to
take on all the risk with building new nuclear.

Nuclear power is expensive and long term. What really counts is the next few years.
New nuclear is a kind of distraction. As for existing nuclear – I am always at pains to
say: Close down fossil fuels before you close down nuclear. Once you’ve done that,
close down nuclear.

Nuclear fusion might be different. I am very curious about the rash of fusion startups
around the world. But it’s low carbon. So, our view is, nuclear bonds count.

We need to lean in. The most urgent task right now is to close down fossil fuels.
Anything beyond tomorrow morning is an ugly compromise. So, I have to be
supportive of the Japanese Cabinet’s decision to restart nuclear. But they are not
having a lot of success with it. They might have more success if they promised to close
down all reactors by the 2030s.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

What’s your stance on carbon capture and storage (CCS)?

We are supportive of carbon capture and sequestration. We just don't think it would
be affordable and big enough to be able to solve the issues of the entire energy
system. But in certain places like in cement we’re going to need it. Above all, we’re
going to need it for Direct Air Capture to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

If you can get your emissions down, I’m in love with you! So, whatever it takes. But I
expect you not to leak any CO2. And we know that CCS plants around the world are
leaking like a sieve and the amount of capture has been relatively limited. So, we
need to do a lot of work. It’s very hard to see it being commercially viable, especially
for energy use, for a long time.

Some CCS technologies look very exciting. I’m a bit dubious about whether we can
make storage of a liquid underground for long periods particularly secure. But even if
it buys us another 20 years, at the moment it helps. So, I’m a great supporter if you
can make it work. I just think that the coal and gas industry’s dream of having CCS as a
major industry is a bit of a pipe dream.

Imminent LNG Deals Likely to Forge Japan’s Future Stance on
Russian Energy

Within about a year, Japan will likely make decisions that will dictate the nature of its
energy ties with Russia over the coming decades.

Talks over the future status of a small-scale Russia-Japan LNG contract will have to
begin in 2025, at the latest. How those negotiations proceed will impact
developments around a number of LNG contracts two years further along, and
subsequent deals.

In total, the status of close to 10% of Japan’s imports of the super-chilled fuel is at
stake, with decisions on the majority of the volume due well before the end of this
decade. What’s more, the two countries are connected via the Arctic LNG 2 project in
northern Russia, which has recently been hit by stringent U.S. sanctions, also nullifying
Tokyo’s option to tap into those volumes.

After Russia’s incursion into Ukraine two years ago, Japan was quick to join its G7
allies in assigning strict sanctions on trade with the northern neighbor. Energy was the
main exception due the value that Russian oil, coal, and most importantly, LNG, have
for Japan. Still, Prime Minister Kishida vowed to minimize the energy relationship over
time.

Finding alternatives has been far from straightforward. And with the U.S. presidential
elections due in November, Tokyo’s uncertainties over whether to shrink its energy
relationship with Moscow are increasing. Ordinarily, Japan would try to keep the
nuanced status quo, maintaining the current level of ties. But then these are not
ordinary times.

Sanctions and impact
In the weeks after Russian troops entered Ukraine, PM Kishida confirmed Japan’s
position to support the G7 in sanctioning Moscow’s economic activities. In terms of
Japan’s trade with Russia, Kishisa announced plans to phase out purchases of its crude
oil (4% of Japan’s total at the time) and, over time, imports of its coal (13% at the
time).


Unlike firms from the U.S. and most of Europe, however, Japanese trading houses and
the state-backed JOGMEC remained as shareholders in existing Russian oil and gas
projects on Sakhalin Island (Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2) and in the northern Arctic area
(Arctic LNG-2).

Japanese firms were also involved in the financing and engineering of the Yamal LNG
project, which sits close to Arctic LNG-2. Both projects are led by Russia’s Novatek.
Aside from a few geological surveys elsewhere in Russia, most of which are now
complete, a Japanese group remains involved in an oil exploration and development
venture in eastern Siberia (INK-Zapad). Oil upstream firm INPEX was reported in

23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

January as ready to sell its stake in INK-Zapad, but the other two firms in the Japanese
group, JOGMEC and trading house Itochu, remain invested.

The equity investments are separate – though often associated with – offtake
agreements from the projects. Still, in a sanctions environment, even when Japanese
end-users are ready to get the fuel, the delivery, insurance, and payment become
difficult if not impossible without direct state intervention. As such, Japanese
companies have, thus far, mostly curtailed their deliveries of Russian energy products
without moving to liquidate the equity stakes.

The result is that last year Russian oil purchases were almost at zero; coal imports were
1% of Japan’s total. Hence, the recent strengthening of U.S. sanctions against Russian
energy products, which was followed by Japan’s Ministry of Finance hitting Russian
crude oil with stricter measures around price caps, is largely procedural. It will affect
very little actual cargo.

Regarding LNG, however, the story is more complicated. Japanese purchases were
unchanged last year. In 2023, Russia remained the third-largest supplier of LNG to
Japan. Its market share in Japan has stayed in the 9-10% range for the last few years.

All in all, Japan’s assessment of the sanctions is mixed. A recent JOGMEC
presentation shows that Russia has likely lost out on about 89% of potential LNG
revenues due to its new projects being frozen, but Moscow’s losses in oil are only at
about a quarter of its potential sales given the much bigger, more liquid and hard-to-
control nature of crude markets.


The exception or the rule?
While Japan won an exception for LNG in the G7 sanctions against Russia, Tokyo was
seemingly under the impression that the restrictions would not apply to all ‘current’
projects. What that means in practice is less straightforward.

Nearly all of the Russian LNG delivered to Japan comes from the Sakhalin-2 project.
However, at the time of the sanctions writing, Novatek was already working with its
international partners, including Japan, to build the Arctic LNG-2 project that was due
to start working in late 2023 or early this year.

Japan seemed to assume that Arctic LNG-2 would also be treated as an exception
because it was already in the construction phase. In 2020, then METI minister Seko
called it the biggest Japan-Russia energy project to date, based on costs. JOGMEC,
together with Mitsui as a minority partner, took a 10% equity stake and guaranteed
over $1 billion in Japanese bank financing.

Eventually, with three trains (units) completed, Arctic LNG-2 was supposed to provide
a massive 19.8 million tons of LNG production a year.

The U.S. administration appeared to see the sanctions remit differently. Once it was
clear that Novatek was able to move forward with construction despite the various
sanctions in place, in part thanks to Chinese assistance, the U.S. decided to up the
ante. Since September 2023, three rounds of sanctions from the U.S. and the UK have
fallen on the Arctic LNG-2 project, the latest announced in February 2024.

Seeing no way to proceed, JOGMEC repaid 814 million euros of loans in January this
year, indicating that Japanese lenders have mostly pulled out of the project.

The future of Arctic LNG-2 appears as frozen as the nature around it. But selling the
Japanese equity now would be financially and politically damaging. The most likely
potential buyers would be either Russian entities or Chinese. Neither option would
work well from the Japanese side.

And so, almost the entirety of Japan-Russia energy relations now rest firmly on the
LNG purchasing contracts between Japanese utilities and the operating entity of
Sakhalin-2. But these contracts are coming up for renewal.

Renew or quit?
The first contract due to run out is worth 0.5 million tons per annum (Mtpa) and is held
by JERA. It is a 15-year deal signed around the time of the 2011 Fukushima disaster,
when Japanese energy needs suddenly jumped to cover the inability to run nuclear
power plants. The contract ends in 2026.

It is customary to begin renewal negotiations, which can involve talks over a price
update, a year or so before the contract ends.


A number of Sakhalin-2 contracts are then due to expire in 2028. Two of those are
with Japanese gas utilities; the rest with non-Japanese parties that have offered part
of those volumes in the Japanese market on a spot basis. A second 1.5-Mtpa JERA
contract is due to expire in 2029. Five more Japanese offtake deals will conclude
between 2030 and 2033.

Looking at the cost and logistics, it is a no-brainer for Japan to roll over the deals.
Russia has been one of its cheapest LNG suppliers over the past decade, beating
Australia and the U.S. by at least half a dollar per MMbtu.

One of the reasons is that cargoes from Sakhalin can arrive in Japanese ports in 2-3
days. That compares with 25 days for ships traveling from the Gulf of Mexico under
normal conditions, as well as issues with both the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal /
Red Sea that have made global LNG navigation much more complicated and costly.
The shortest ship journey from Australia to Japan is still two weeks.

Given such conditions, and the fact that Sakhalin-2 has been a stable and reliable
supplier since its launch 15 years ago, renewing the Japanese offtake contracts will be
tempting. But, industry insiders believe that Japan’s power companies like JERA
simply won’t want to take on the risks of Russian LNG deliveries as long as Moscow’s
military campaigns ensue.

Environmental-leaning voices question whether Japan will even miss these volumes
once the current contracts run out. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial
Analysis said in a March report that Japanese utilities may find themselves over-
contracted to the tune of 11 Mtpa by the end of this decade.

Conclusions
In terms of long-term resource planning and geopolitical strategy, Japan has good
reasons not to break all the energy trade with Russia. After all, no regime lasts forever
and having a seedling ready for next spring is pragmatic.

What’s more, if Japan would let go of its investments in Russia, it would not only lose
claim to the resources it helped to discover and develop, it would likely receive zero
compensation, as well as incur retaliation through other trade means, or worse, see
the assets fall into Chinese hands.

Securing similar volumes elsewhere is also far from straightforward given the U.S. has
(at least temporarily) paused the issue of new LNG export licenses. Also, the cost of
Australia supply is set to rise due to environmental requirements; and Japan’s
investments in Mozambique LNG are at the mercy of local insurgents.

But Japan may have an unlikely ally interested in preserving the status quo: Russia
itself. For all the saber-rattling and bluster, Moscow is aware of the importance of its
LNG exports to Japan. And Russia’s alternatives are also not entirely rosy. For one,
Chinese planners are worried about importing much more Russian gas, fearing the
same dependency that hampered Europe.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

China / Wind power
Global wind turbine orders posted a record 155 GW of capacity procured in 2023, up
by 16 GW from 2022. China posted the largest annual order intake on record at 100
GW, according to Wood Mackenzie.

Energy / AI
Around 65% of energy and natural resources executives in 2023 believed that artificial
intelligence and digital technologies will contribute significantly to their operations by
2030, reports Bain & Company. Also, 70% of the executives think that generative AI
will improve maintenance, including predictive maintenance.

Energy transition
The global energy transition remains “off track” despite record-high renewables
growth in 2023, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, adding that
the world needs an additional 7.2 TW of renewables capacity to reach 2030 targets.

India / Power
Coal India Ltd and Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam inked an MoU to explore
development of 4.1 GW of thermal and renewable power generation.

LNG / Spot market
Buyers from China, India and parts of SE Asia are securing more spot shipments of
LNG after prices fell to their lowest level in nearly three years. This price-led demand
revival could push LNG imports by China, the world's top buyer, beyond its record
volume of 78.8 MMT, and also raise India's imports by about 10% this year.

Oil markets / tankers
The world could face a tanker shortage if the geopolitical crisis in the Red Sea persists
for another six months, said the head of Kuwait Petroleum Corp.

Philippines / Wind power
The Dept of Energy awarded about 500 MW of wind power service contracts to
Repower Energy Development Corp, which covers four onshore and offshore projects
in Quezon province.

Singapore / Nuclear power
Singapore is exploring the possible development of nuclear energy, with a main focus
on addressing safety issues. Currently, about 95% of Singapore’s electricity is
generated from imported LNG.

Taiwan / Offshore wind
In 2023, Taiwan’s total installed offshore wind farm capacity reached 2.25 GW, hitting
its 2.03 GW to 2.43 GW target, and making the country Asia Pacific's leading market,
according to the country’s Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Vietnam / Green exports
The U.S. has inked a $500 million deal to boost green exports to Vietnam. These are
exports related to renewable energy, the climate, and infrastructure. American
companies can receive loans and other backing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank.
