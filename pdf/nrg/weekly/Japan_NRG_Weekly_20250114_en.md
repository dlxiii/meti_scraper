MLIT, MoE tap 16 projects to promote zero-emission ship building
(Government statement, Jan 9)
•  MLIT and MoE announced 16 projects under the Zero-Emission Ship Construction Promotion
Project. These include:

•  1) Hydrogen engine / FC system / hydrogen supply equipment: Yanmar Power Technology; 2)
Ammonia engine: Japan Engine Corp, Daihatsu Diesel; 3) Ammonia/hydrogen engine parts:
Volcano, Nippon Nozzle Seiki
•  The goal is to reduce CO2 emissions while also strengthening the international competitiveness of
Japan's shipbuilding industry by building a supply base for zero-emission ships that use ammonia,
hydrogen fuel, etc.
•  The government will cover part of the costs to develop production for engines, fuel tanks, fuel

supply systems, etc to build zero-emission ships, and to develop facilities for installing this marine
equipment on ships.
•  CONTEXT: MLIT sees conversion of ship fuel as a chance for Japan’s shipbuilding industry to make
a breakthrough and “secure a top share of orders for next-gen ships for the maritime industry by
2030”. Japan’s shipbuilding and marine equipment industries will invest over ¥120 billion in
production and will significantly increase capacity to build ships that run on ammonia fuel and

other clean fuels, as well as to produce zero-emission engines and other products.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
J-ENG’s ammonia-fuel engine approved for zero-emission ship
(Company statement, Jan 9)
o  Japan Engine Corp (J-ENG) was chosen as part of the "Zero-Emission Ship Construction
Promotion Project" to expand production capacity for ammonia fuel engines.
o  J-ENG plans to complete its first full-scale ammonia fuel engine in 2025, with operational

trials in 2026. Investment could total ¥20 billion by 2028, including ¥6.64 billion in state
subsidies.
o  The company plans to increase the share of new fuel engines from 10% to 40% by 2033,
and to 100% by 2040. By 2050, the company seeks to produce 100 ammonia fuel
engines annually, capturing a 20-30% global market share.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

ANRE, JOGMEC update application rules for low-carbon fuel price difference support

(Government statement, Dec 26)
•  ANRE and JOGMEC updated application information for the Price Difference Support Program of
the Low-Carbon Hydrogen etc Supply Chain Development Support Project.
•  CONTEXT: This is popularly known as the Contract for Difference (CfD) program.
•  ANRE added new questions and answers to the FAQ sheet, and also added examples to the
application form instructions. The main additions are the timing and frequency of grant payments,
eligible expenses, calculation of standard prices, and conditions related to SPCs.

•  JOGMEC announced the subsidy grant regulations and prepared the format of the application
form. The companies that have applied to METI and have been certified through the screening
process will submit this grant application to JOGMEC.
•  The application form includes the amount of subsidy requested for each year based on the
business plan submitted to METI.
•  CONTEXT: On Oct 23, 2024, the day the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act came into force, ANRE

unveiled a website to provide information on support projects, and on Nov 22, applications for the
Price Difference Support Program (CfD) began.
• TAKEAWAY: The fact that JOGMEC announced the subsidy regulations more than a month after METI began
accepting applications means that some companies will soon be certified by METI. Applications to METI will
be accepted until late March 2025, but the contents of the business plans are reviewed in the order of
application. Certified companies will have to prepare a new application form and undergo a review by
JOGMEC; it’s unclear how long it will take to decide on the grant.

middleware.
•  The platform claims it can process high-volume transactions and safeguard power generation data.
The goal is to accurately record the time that non-fossil power sources generate power and link
that data with demand data to assign the environmental value of each time period. It will reflect
the different energy mixes in each time period to accurately calculate the non-fossil fuel ratio.
•  CONTEXT: Current practice of using non-fossil certificates without time-based verification makes it
hard to ensure in real-time that the electricity comes from renewable sources. For instance, relying

solely on solar power increases the use of CO2-heavy thermal power at night. To encourage
renewable energy use around the clock, it’s crucial to align environmental value with supply and
demand by time.

LTDA clean power capacity auction to start later this month, 5 GW to be offered

(Japan NRG, Jan 10)
•  Round 2 of the bidding in the LTDA (Long-term decarbonization power source auction) is due to
start on Jan 20, with strong interest expected from the battery/ BESS and nuclear sectors
especially.
•  Total capacity on offer will be 5 GW, up from 4 GW in Round 1 (excluding LNG-fired capacity).
•  For batteries and pumped storage, the minimum capacity for bidding has been changed from 10
MW to 30 MW, and the application quota and upper limit are set according to operation duration
(750 MW for storage durations of 3 to 6 hours, and the same for storage of 6 hours or more; total –

1.5 GW).
•  The auction has updated criteria for other generation types. These include:
o  Boosting nuclear’s cap to 2 GW and allowing the money to cover investment in the safety
upgrades of existing facilities;
o  Allowing ammonia / hydrogen co-firing to include fuel costs as part of the fixed cost
calculations (up to a maximum value);
o  Adding 4 GW as a separate cap to the 5 GW specifically for LNG-fired thermal power

plants; the previously allocated 6 GW for the sector was almost entirely used up in Round
1.
• TAKEAWAY: Several developments in power markets this year will be encouraging for BESS operators on top
of existing opportunities. In the Balancing/ Ancillary products market, there’ll be a change starting April to the
bidding unit and response time for the Replacement Reserve for FIT, the category known as Balancing
Capacity III (2) or ３次調整力（２）in Japanese. Currently, generation units that qualify need to startup within
45 mins and offer 3 hours of service. That will change to activation within 60 minutes and bidding via 30-

minute segments. There is also expected to be progress towards the creation of a so-called simultaneous
market that would combine the bidding of volume (kWh) with adjustment capacity (delta kW). Finally, more
T&D firms are expected to offer contracts to pumped hydro facilities to secure last-minute reserves.

ANALYSIS

BY NOBUO TANAKA
Nuclear Crisis in Japan: Old Ideas Hold Back Sector from Aiding Net-Zero

In October, “Nippon Hidankyo” – the organization that represents survivors of the
U.S. nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 – received the 2024
Nobel Peace Prize. This decision reflects a sense of urgency among the global
community about the rising risk of nuclear war as international tensions accelerate.

Yuval Noah Harari, author of The Sapiens, has said that nuclear war is the first of the
three key challenges that humans face in the 21st century. The other two being a
climate crisis and disruptions from Artificial Intelligence. And so, as nuclear war is once
again discussed as a potential outcome, can humanity step away from the abyss?
Japanese people, more than anyone, understand the consequences.

But this essay isn’t about nuclear war. What I worry about is that Japan is losing its
nuclear capability for peaceful purposes.

In the post-war era, Japan harnessed the atom to power industries, ranking among the
top five nuclear energy producers globally before 2011. At that time, the nation had
54 reactors that could supply about 30% of its electricity. Today, just 14 reactors are
online and they cover only 8% of the total. Even that is a small grace compared to a
period of zero nuclear power generation, which Japan experienced in the aftermath of
the March 2011 Fukushima disaster.


This nuclear energy ‘winter’ shut down more than plants. The number of Japanese
students enrolling in advanced nuclear studies at universities dropped from a high of
over 500 in the mid 1990s to 185 in 2022.

With no new reactors slated for construction, the industry’s supply chain has
atrophied. METI promotes a so-called Advanced Light Water Reactor (LWR), a safer
model of the current reactor type to replace older units. But unless it is rolled out at
scale and completed on time, costs will invariably balloon, as has been the case in
Finland, France and the U.S.

Unlike the Soviet Union’s post-Chernobyl program to sell its nuclear power plants
abroad, Japan has had no overseas contracts to sustain its nuclear supply chains. We
offered our LWR reactors to Vietnam, Turkey, UAE and the UK, but lost out to
competitors each time. Though very safe, large Japanese LWRs are not price
competitive in the global market and would lead to higher electricity prices.

In this context, it’s not surprising that the Japanese government decided to extend
the operation period for existing domestic reactors from 40 years to more than 60,
and focus its nuclear energy policy on restarting the existing units. But while Japan
has focused on reviving the past, the global nuclear sector has moved on.

Innovation in reactor technology
Overseas, there is now increased focus on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to power
the proliferating data centers, generative AI and industrial heat. There are many

20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

venture companies in the U.S., UK, and Canada at work designing diverse types of
SMRs. Even South Korea, which had been successful in winning large reactor contracts
overseas, is now determined to develop SMRs.

China has already deployed an SMR, as has Russia. But not one company in Japan is
interested in this technology. My concern is, Japan’s nuclear capability could
disappear when conventional LWRs plants shut down.

The Fukushima disaster killed the notion of nuclear power as a cheap, clean and safe
source of electricity. While almost 14 years have passed, the trauma of Fukushima
remains. Many think that kejime (the final responsibility) of the accident has not been
proven. But if there isn’t an acknowledgement of responsibility and mistakes, it will be
difficult to do things differently in the future.

Here’s an interesting observation made by an all-female investment consulting firm.
Half a year before the Fukushima accident, they stopped recommending TEPCO stock
to their clients. This wasn't due to a superhuman premonition. The consultants were
simply good at keeping records of company actions and errors, and their monitoring
of TEPCO showed a company that repeated mistakes time after time, with no effort to
reform.

My concern is that post-Fukushima, the men who monopolize Japan’s nuclear sector
are making the same errors because they do not acknowledge their responsibilities.
They wish to pursue the same nuclear reactor model as before – a large LWR, built in
a remote town, operating as a base load source. What energy systems need today,
however, is flexibility and speed, as well as CO2-free power. SMRs seem more fitting
both to complement the fluctuations of solar and wind power, and support data
centers and carbon intensive industries.

Whether it is SMRs or another innovation, we need a change in mindset. That’s the
reason I created a working group for advanced nuclear systems at the Canon Institute
of Global Studies, but ensured that only women are members of the group. If this
group can agree that a new system for nuclear power is “sustainable,” then there’s a
higher chance that it will be accepted by the Japanese public.


Innovation in waste storage
Figuring out the safety systems of new reactors is only one of the issues we need to
solve, however, to retain the use of nuclear energy. The other key point is the disposal
of waste.

Anti-nuclear activists often say that a nuclear system is a condominium without toilets.
The sector focuses on safety but leaves the issue of radioactive waste for future
generations to resolve.

This is a tricky topic and not only for Japan. Only Finland and Sweden, and maybe
France, have decided on disposal sites. Meanwhile, Japan’s program to find a site
stumbles on without result for decades. The latest is that three localities have agreed
to preliminary reviews of their areas as a potential location. But regional authorities
have already vowed to stop any future site construction.


21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Meanwhile, there’s a lot of waste to manage, including at the Fukushima site, and no
prefecture is keen to accept it. Radiation takes over 300,000 years to abate naturally.

The Rokkasho reprocessing plant – if it is ever launched – could shorten at least the
spent-fuel disposal problem to 9,000 years. Another new technology promises to
shorten this to 300 years, which is manageable. But this tech, called Integral Fast
Reactor (IFR) with Pyroprocessing, was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory
in the U.S. It differs from the PUREX technology being built at Rokkasho.

IFR is much simpler and cheaper than PUREX. It consists of a metal fuel, sodium
coolant, fast neutron reactor and pyroprocessing unit connected in one facility. It also
lowers the risk of proliferation.

At the Sasakawa Peace Foundation I asked experts to estimate the cost of building a
facility to apply this technology to the Fukushima debris solution*. The estimate was
¥300 billion ($2 billion).

So, why won’t Japan introduce it? Speaking with people in Fukushima, their reaction
was favorable. But once again, the mindset of never changing is holding Japan’s
nuclear sector back. Friends at METI and TEPCO tell me that while they understand
the potential of U.S. technology, they can't change their plans. “It would be different
from what we’ve already told the people in Fukushima,” they say.


























Fortunately, not everyone is wedded to the ideas of the past. A female expert from
Fukushima**, Nagayama Chieko, is an observer with the CIGS working group. She
says that we cannot hold onto the old saying that Fukushima is utsukushima
(“beautiful land”), we need to update the mindset to treating it as tsukusushima (“land

that contributes to science”). If only METI and TEPCO officials felt as willing to
innovate.

Nagayama’s organization, CIGS, published a report advocating for trialing IFR with the
idea that it could be piloted in Fukushima and then deployed nationwide. Luckily,
Fukui prefecture has shown an interest and established a consortium to build IFR.

Technology should be used to unite us. With IFR, I see the potential for its
introduction in South Korea also. In fact, I propose trilateral collaboration between
Japan, Korea and the U.S. to develop IFR and Pyroprocessing as well as nuclear
propulsion submarines.

Geopolitics in Northeast Asia legitimizes this collaboration. When three countries can
find the solution to Fukushima debris as the ultimate peaceful use of nuclear power, I
dare say that Japan can finally overcome the trauma of Fukushima, Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.

ANALYSIS

BY MAGDALENA OSUMI
Headwinds in Japan’s Offshore Sector Show Value of Good Planning

No sooner had Japan announced the results of Round 3 offshore wind auctions, than
attention shifted from the big wins for JERA and Marubeni to the fact that many of the
major industry players abstained from bidding.

Media reports of potential losses for winners of Round 1 followed. Pundits questioned
Japan’s ability to meet its wind capacity goals for 2030, while developers bemoaned
the weak yen and supply chain headaches.

So, is Japan losing its allure as a lucrative destination for offshore wind power?

Au contraire.


The challenges in Japan’s offshore wind sector were always on the cards as the
teething pains of setting up a new national infrastructure segment. Inflation,
community and even currency issues echo those elsewhere. At least Japan’s leaders
support wind power rather than calling it “garbage,” as per the opinion of the
incoming U.S. president.

The potential size of the Japanese market; the legislative push to expand the available
sea areas; the political backing; and (slowly) stabilizing domestic supply chains
indicate to many industry players that projects in Japan are worth it. Some equipment
suppliers say they see strong order growth in the second half of this decade. But in
the short term, expect choppy waters.

Japan NRG looks at the state of play in the sector in the aftermath of Round 3 results.

The Departed of Japanese wind
The enactment in 2018 of the Act on Promotion of Use of Marine Areas for
Development of Marine Renewable Energy Generation Facilities was a milestone for
Japan in expanding the use of renewables. It attracted the attention not only of
energy companies but plenty of other businesses that saw in wind power what they
did not in solar – scale.

According to one of Japan’s major think tanks, the Mitsubishi Research Institute, the
country’s seas can accommodate 70 GW of fixed and as much as 2,396 GW of floating
wind power capacity.

The size of the potential story attracted several dozen companies to bid in the first
two rounds for offshore wind auctions hosted by Japan. Winning consortiums even
included two overseas energy firms: Germany’s RWE and Spain’s Iberdrola.

Round 3 covered two areas off the coasts of Aomori and Yamagata prefectures. The
Aomori site was awarded to a consortium of JERA, renewables developer Green
Power Investment and Tohoku Electric. The second went to a group comprising


24



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Marubeni, Kansai Electric, BP Iota Holdings (a unit of the UK’s bp), Tokyo Gas, and
local construction firm Marutaka.

While Round 3 featured yet another European winner and several fresh domestic
faces, media coverage focused instead on those who had abstained from the latest
auction, noting that most winners from Round 1 and 2 did not participate in Round 3.

To further the claim that Japan’s offshore wind tenders were losing their luster, media
pointed to Cosmo, which owns Cosmo Eco Power, the third-largest wind power firm in
Japan, and its decision not to bid for Round 3 after completing an environmental
impact survey off the coast of Yamagata Pref. and concluding that a project there
would simply not be profitable.

Similarly, before placing the bid for the Aomori block, JERA surveyed both sites but
chose only one.

This is where, however, it’s worth considering that the scale of the offshore wind
business opportunities are starting to catch up with even the biggest companies in the
sectors. Firms like Mitsubishi Corp, JERA, Chubu Electric and Tohoku Electric, for
example, have already secured two or three major projects of at least 300 MW of
capacity that will require a years-long process of procuring the turbines, foundations,
and electrical systems before the start of construction, let alone commissioning.


If the floating offshore wind project in Nagasaki Pref from Round 1 is taken into
consideration, the number of firms financially committed to multiple projects rises to
include Kansai Electric, ENEOS, and Osaka Gas.

Investments in the larger projects will hover around $3–5 million per installed MW,
eventually amounting to several hundred million dollars for fixed-bottom technology.
Taking a break to assess the existing commitments and focus on making progress on
them are good reasons for sidestepping the latest round.

Expansion through trial and error
To be sure, the zeal to be among the first wind auction winners has come back to bite
certain players, none more so that top trading house Mitsubishi, which swept all three
bottom-fixed projects from Round 1 in 2021. Three years later, the company is
believed to be facing severe challenges with these projects.

While winners of the Round 3 rejoiced in celebrations over the Christmas period,
business magazine Diamond ran an investigative report claiming industry rumors say
Mitsubishi may even withdraw from its Round 1 projects. The report exposed
Mitsubishi’s missteps in project planning and worsening external economic pressures.

According to Diamond, the trading house rushed a seabed analysis, which led to
unforeseen issues with the project area’s soft ground. This required additional costly
studies and design adjustments. Other misjudgments were related to onshore
transmission infrastructure, which incurred significant costs and delays.

The magazine raises questions whether delays in the 391 MW Choshi project in Chiba
Pref, the first among three originally scheduled to start operations in 2028, could

25

cause a domino effect on subsequent projects. This is the first bottom-fixed offshore
wind power project in the general-sea-area in Japan.

The project’s cost estimates, based on overly optimistic fixed price purchase
agreements under the FIT system, were apparently misaligned with actual
construction expenses. Industry insiders told Diamond they expect Mitsubishi’s losses
on the three projects to exceed ¥100 billion ($630 million).

Financial challenges
Mitsubishi’s big win in 2021 was largely due to the trading house correctly reading the
mood of the government at the time. Back then, METI was determined for offshore
wind costs to be driven down as quickly as possible to avoid a repeat of what
happened in the solar sector as it first took off. Overly generous state tariffs turbo-
charged the solar boom but also saddled the country’s consumers with high bills.

Mitsubishi focused on price over speed of execution. Critics warned that this could
lead to delays in delivery of the capacity, and the company’s current troubles seem to
be confirming such concerns. As a result, METI and MLIT have altered their project
evaluations to focus more on feasibility of operators’ plans, risk assessments, backup
plans – both for the construction phase and while in operation.

The changing dynamics were clearly picked up on by the bidders in the latest round.
In Round 3, all bidders seemed to offer electricity prices at the minimum, so-called
zero-premium level of ¥3/ kWh, to secure top scores in the pricing category.


The sacrifices from the bidders are being recognized by the government. After all,
wind projects in other countries, and energy infrastructure projects in general, are
facing many of the same challenges: rising materials costs, contractor scarcity due to
inflation and labor shortages, currency fluctuations, and rising borrowing costs.

Over the past couple years, the offshore wind industry has experienced several project
cancellations and delays globally. For instance, in April 2024, New York State
canceled power contracts for three offshore wind projects due to concerns over
financial viability and turbine supply.

To ensure that Japan’s offshore wind sector can stay on course not just now but into
the 2030s, when it is expected to play an outsized role in the nation’s energy mix,
METI and other state agencies are looking at new ways to support the sector. Details
are likely to emerge later in the year, based on progress of projects already auctioned
off, but the intent is clear. Last month, METI’s draft of the new Basic Energy Policy
called for wind power to deliver as much as 8% of the nation’s total by 2040.

Mitsubishi’s further moves to mitigate their emerging challenges, particularly
regarding the Choshi project, will also influence government response toward other
operators.

Conclusion
With most of the projects currently under development in Japan scheduled to launch
by 2030, the offshore wind power industry is – contrary to claims of dwindling interest
– approaching a period of significant growth.

Costs remain a major challenge, but this benefits those developers that can channel
both scale and expertise into project management, while keeping a close eye on
technological evolution. Further tweaks to Japan’s auction system to cover cost
uncertainties are also likely.

Mitsubishi was envied for sweeping Round 1 and immediately gaining scale. Time has
shown that scale alone won’t lead to profits; identifying and acknowledging the risks is
key. In this sector, being first is not the same as being a winner.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This column provides a brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Clean energy
ZEN Energy, in partnership with Taiwan’s HD Renewable Energy (HDRE), plans a JV in
Australia that will build 1 GW of power storage capacity. The two companies will
launch a green energy investment and management platform called ZEBRE, with a
total target investment capacity of 1.4 GW. HDRE will have a 70% stake; Zen the
remaining 30%.

Asia / Oil
Asia's crude oil imports dropped in 2024, the first annual decline in three years, led by
weak demand from China, with only India managing meager growth. The world's top
importing region saw imports of 26.51 mbpd in 2024, down 1.4% from the 26.88
mbpd in 2023, according to LSEG Oil Research.

China / EVs
China will exceed both international forecasts and its own official targets for domestic
EV sales, growing about 20% YoY to more than 12 million cars in 2025, according to
the FT. This will more than double the 5.9 million sold in 2022.

China / Hydropower
China approved construction of what will be the world's largest hydropower dam, to
be located in the lower Yarlung Tsangpo River; it could generate three times more
energy than Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydropower plant.

China / Solar and hydrogen
CHN Energy said its 400 MW Rudong integrated PV-hydrogen-storage project was
connected to the grid on Dec 31. The project, which is located on the coastal flats in
Rudong County, is China’s first integrated offshore facility combining PV power
generation, hydrogen production and refueling, and energy storage.

India / Power generation
Over the past decade, the country’s total installed power generation capacity grew to
457 GW today, up 83.8% from 249 GW as of March 2014.

Philippines
Citicore Renewables Energy sold a 20% stake to Pertamina Power Indonesia. The
Philippines is one of the fastest growing markets for renewable energy investment,
and the $115 million of proceeds from the deal will be used towards hydro, wind and
solar projects in the country.

South Korea / Offshore wind
Korea South-East Power (KOEN) will exit the 390 MW Shinan-Ui offshore wind farm
that it was developing with Hanwha Ocean and SK D&D. KOEN owns a 37% share in
the project, to be built off the Korean peninsula’s southwest.

South Korea / Renewables
Hithium and Samsung C&T Engineering group inked a deal to jointly develop energy
storage projects globally, with a pipeline estimated at 10 GW/h.

Taiwan / Gas turbines
Natural gas turbine maker GE Vernova sees opportunities in Taiwan, which is set to
phase out nuclear power this year and needs more gas-fired generation to power its
chip-making industry. In mid 2025, Taiwan will shut its last active commercial NPP,
Maanshan.
