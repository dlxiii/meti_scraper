NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





METI to mandate participation in carbon emissions trading scheme

(NHK, Denki Shimbun, Nov 21)
•  METI announced plans to mandate participation in carbon emissions trading for companies
emitting over 100,000 tons of CO2 annually, starting in FY2026.
•  Japan’s carbon emissions trading mechanism might cover up to 400 companies in industries such
as steel, electricity, aviation, logistics, and food manufacturing.
•  The mandate will apply to companies whose average emissions over three years exceed 100,000
tons. The govt will annually allocate emissions quotas to these companies free of charge.

•  Companies emitting less than their quota can sell the surplus, while those exceeding their limit
must purchase additional quotas or face penalties.
•  To enforce mandatory participation by FY2026, the govt plans to submit legal amendments during
the ordinary session of the Diet next year, with actual trading expected to begin in FY2027.



Japan’s share of non-fossil fuels in energy mix at highest in 25 years
(Government statement, Nov 22)
•  METI published highlights of its 2023 national energy supply and demand review.
•  Energy demand:

o  Final energy consumption decreased by 3% YoY, with reductions in city gas use (-4.1%),
coal (-4.0%), oil (-2.9%), and electricity (-2.5%);
o  Industrial sectors saw declines due to sluggish manufacturing activity, while household
consumption dropped as more staff returned to the office;
o  Transportation energy consumption was down slightly (-0.6%).
•  Energy supply:
o  Domestic primary energy supply fell 4.1%, with fossil fuels down 7% and non-fossil fuels

up 10.6%;
o  Renewable energy, led by solar, grew for the 11th consecutive year;
o  Non-fossil fuels reached a 19.2% share, the highest in 25 years, with nuclear energy
increasing 51.2%.
•  Power generation:
o  Total generation was down 1.6% to 985.4 TWh, the lowest since 2010;

o  Non-fossil fuel generation exceeded 30% for the first time since the Fukushima disaster,
reaching 31.4%;
o  Renewables (including hydro) accounted for 22.9%;
o  Nuclear at 8.5%;
o  Thermal generation (excluding biomass) at 68.6%.
•  CO2 emissions:
o  Energy-related CO2 emissions dropped 4.8% YoY to 920 million tons, a 25.9% reduction

from 2013 levels, the lowest since 1990;

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Power sector CO2 emissions intensity fell by 4.1% to 0.45 kg-CO2/kWh.
•  Energy self-sufficiency:
o  Japan’s energy self-sufficiency rate rose to 15.2%, its highest since the Fukushima
disaster, driven by increased use of non-fossil energy sources.
• TAKEAWAY: Data shows that Japan’s decarbonization is progressing, though clearly much of that progress is

due to lower energy consumption. That will change at least in the next few years as more data centers and
other IT-related facilities come online. Japan must find a way to continue the same rate of emission reduction
without sacrificing supply.



METI to keep target of nuclear power in energy mix for FY2040
(Nikkei, Nov 19)
•  METI plans to keep nuclear power's share in the nation's energy mix at about 20% for FY2040,

consistent with the 20–22% target for 2030. The govt has clarified plans for rebuilding aging
nuclear plants. These measures will be included in the next national energy policy update.
•  Challenges include streamlining the process of NRA reviews and obtaining consent from local
governments and communities.
•  Companies want stronger govt support to ensure investment viability. This is due to the high costs
of nuclear plant construction and renovation.
•  Also, renewable energy targets are set to expand, with the current goal of 36–38% by 2030

expected to increase by 2040.
•  CONTEXT: Before the Fukushima accident in March 2011, nuclear accounted for about 30% of
Japan’s electricity, but that dropped to 5.5% in FY2022. Currently, 13 reactors across seven NPPs
have restarted, but doubling this number is necessary to meet state targets. By year’s end, METI
will likely set a target for FY2040.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI discusses removal of nuclear power reliance reduction policy
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 21)
o  METI’s Nuclear Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Energy that’s tasked with
revising the Basic Energy Plan discussed removal of the phrase "reducing reliance on
nuclear power as much as possible", which is in the current plan.
o  Several members called for this change, such as Prof Saito Takumi (Takushoku University)

and Ono Toru of the Keidanren.
o  Matayoshi Yuka of SMBC Nikko Securities said nuclear power is essential for energy
supply and net-zero goals. Chairman Kurosaki Ken (Kyoto University) stressed the need to
clarify the role of nuclear power to ensure economic growth.



METI calls to formalize cost recovery measures to speed up grid connection
(Government statement, Nov 19)
•  METI and ANRE seek strict requirements for financing large-scale interregional grid connection
projects as a way to mitigate associated risks and speed up development.

•  Experts recommend to outline cost estimates for potential additional expenses in advance, and to
state these in guidelines. This would help secure cost recovery and facilitate project financing.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The proposal came up at a Nov 20 meeting on cost recovery as part of efforts to establish a grid
connection between Hokkaido and Honshu.
•  CONTEXT: Under the existing transmission tariff system, if costs increase after the project is
launched, the transmission operator must apply to the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance
Commission (EGC) for tariff adjustments. Approval is required for cost recovery, meaning any

unexpected rise in cost is not guaranteed to be covered. Experts pointed out that factors such as
changes in market prices or natural disasters may justify reflecting cost increases in transmission
tariffs.
• TAKEAWAY: The Hokkaido-Honshu subsea transmission project is unprecedented in scale and complexity.
Amid concerns over potential delays due to coordination with stakeholders, ensuring a reliable mechanism for
recovering increased costs is critical for stable progress.




Japan and France review agreement on fast reactor development
(Govt statement, Nov 21)
•  METI and France’s Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission updated their agreement
on fast reactor development, including Japan Atomic Power Co and Électricité de France (EDF).
•  They also broadened technical focus.
•  CONTEXT: Such collaboration between Japan and France began in 2014, and originally included

Japan Atomic Energy Agency, MHI, Mitsubishi FBR Systems, CEA, and FRAMATOME. It focused
on accident countermeasures and developing simulation tools. They also revised the agreement
and extended it in 2019.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan, Peru ink MoC on energy transition
(Government statement, Nov 19)
o  On Nov, 17, METI and Peru's Ministry of Energy and Mines signed an MoC on energy

transition. It covers:
o  Energy management tech for renewables, energy efficiency and storage;
o  Renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and derivatives (ammonia and e-fuels);
o  Promotion of investment opportunities in clean energy.
o  CONTEXT: Over half of Peru's electricity comes from renewables, mostly hydropower, as
well as wind, solar, and bioenergy. Key aspects of Peru's energy strategy include:

diversifying the energy mix by expanding renewables use (wind, solar, geothermal
power), and legislative support for clean energy transition.

EGC seeks to exclude additional capacity to calculate correction imbalance fee
(Government statement, Nov 15)
•  The EGC proposed excluding the impact of additional supply capacity measures from parameters

used to calculate the correction imbalance fee.
•  This fee, designed to rise during tight supply-demand periods, depends on a reserve margin
index. But since FY2024, the index has been skewed by including additional supply measures,
preventing the fee from reflecting actual market conditions.
•  Adjusting the calculation to disregard these measures would better align the fee with the true costs
of addressing supply-demand imbalances.

•  CONTEXT: The extent of the hike in the imbalance fee is determined according to the power
supply margin of TSOs.



Toyota aims to build a hydrogen and ammonia supply chain in Chubu
(Company statement, Nov 18)
•  Toyota Industries Corp signed an MoU with the Chubu Hydrogen and Ammonia Social
Implementation Promotion Council to build a hydrogen and ammonia supply chain in the Chubu

region.
•  They aim to popularize the development, production, and sale of hydrogen-related products such
as fuel cell forklifts and circulation pumps. They’re also considering the use of hydrogen and
ammonia in production activities at their factories.
•  CONTEXT: The Council was established in February 2022 as a forum for local governments and
businesses to cooperate in introducing the use of hydrogen in the region. Companies involved
include Aisin, Aichi Steel, Idemitsu Kosan, AGC, Suntory Holdings, JERA, and Sumitomo Corp.

• TAKEAWAY: Earlier studies by this Council indicates that Chubu could reach hydrogen and ammonia demand
of about 1.2 Mt tons per year from 2027 to 2030. Much of that will be thanks to JERA’s burning of ammonia at
the Hekinan Thermal Power Plant and hydrogen use at Toyota’s factories in fuel-cell vehicles.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Researchers develop tech to synthesize ammonia at room temperature
(Nikkei, Nov 18)
o  Professor Nishibayashi Hitoaki of Tokyo University has developed a method to synthesize
ammonia at room temperature and atmospheric pressure without expensive organic
solvents.
o  The process employs a "mechanochemical reaction" involving reactants such as
samarium iodide, molybdenum catalysts, and water, with cellulose as an alternative

hydrogen source. This could reduce production costs by up to 99%.
o  Companies like Idemitsu Kosan are testing Prof Nishibayashi’s tech in demo plants.
o  CONTEXT: Ammonia is a key ingredient in fertilizers and fuels, and emits no CO2 during
combustion, and can serve as a hydrogen carrier.



Kanadevia to build factory for PEM hydrogen electrolysis stacks
(Company statement, Nov 19)
•  Kanadevia, (formerly Hitachi Zosen) will invest ¥8 billion to build a factory with an annual

production capacity of 1 GW in hydrogen electrolysis stacks.
•  The factory is planned in Tsuru City, Yamanashi Pref. Operations are due to start by the end of
FY2028.
•  The project was selected under METI's "GX Supply Chain Support Program" to promote
decarbonization technologies.
•  CONTEXT: 1 GW of stacks would produce 157,000 tons of hydrogen annually, assuming an
electrolysis efficiency of 5 kWh/ Nm3.

•  Kanadevia’s goal is to integrate hydrogen generation systems with its other clean tech products
such as biogas systems and seawater desalination.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Horiba expands hydrogen inspection equipment production
(Nikkei, Nov 20)
o  Horiba began producing fuel-cell performance evaluation devices at its Michigan factory;

it also has production centers in Japan, Europe, and China.
o  This move aims to capitalize on growing global demand for hydrogen energy tech and is
part of Horiba’s plans to set up a global production network.



Osaka Gas, Marubeni sign MoU on AI system for carbon credits
(Company statement, Nov 18)
•  Osaka Gas and Marubeni Corp signed an MoU to create a framework for evaluating the quality of
carbon credits.
•  Osaka Gas developed an AI system to assess the quality of carbon credit projects. It analyzes

compliance, and has shown accuracy in an initial application for biochar based credits.
•  Marubeni will help commercialize the system, as well as create a platform for global carbon credit
trading.
•  CONTEXT: The global market for carbon credits is expected to reach ¥100 trillion by 2030. Last
week, Osaka Gas announced a business alliance with Sylvera, a company that will help develop the
AI system for assessing credit quality.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

JX holds Vietnam’s first CCS workshop
(Company statement, Nov 15)
o  On Oct 30, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration Corp (JX) sponsored Vietnam's first CCS
business workshop to enhance understanding of CCS, and support legal and regulatory
development.
o  JX shared insights from its Petra Nova CCUS project in the U.S., and emphasized the

importance of accelerating CCS in Vietnam.
o  CONTEXT: JX entered Vietnam's oil and gas sector in 1992 via its subsidiary Japan
Vietnam Petroleum Corporation (JVPC). It launched Southeast Asia's first CO₂-EOR
(Enhanced Oil Recovery) project at the Rang Dong oil field in 2011.



Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance to launch company for CCS
](Nikkei, Nov 18)
•  Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance will launch a specialized insurance product to support companies

entering the CCS sector; it will cover construction and operations risks, as well as physical damage,
lost profits due to delays, and CO2 leakage.
•  This marks the first time a domestic insurer in Japan offers a package covering the various risks tied
to CCS projects.
• TAKEAWAY: Dedicated insurance programs will likely play a huge role in the CCS industry, covering risks such
as CO2 leakage or equipment failures. While they will serve to manage third-party liabilities, the wide scope of
insurance will increase the already high costs of CCS.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
NSE commissioned for CCS framework design
(Nikkei, Nov 22)
o  Nippon Steel Engineering has been commissioned by Mitsubishi Corp, INPEX, and
Nippon Steel to design the basic framework for a CCS project. This involves the

separation, transportation, and underground storage of CO2.
o  This initiative is part of JOGMEC's advanced CCS program that aims to begin CO2
storage by FY2030.



NUMO  completes report on literature review for nuclear waste site
(Govt statement, Nov 22)
•  The Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) completed a report on the
literature review for a final site for high-level radioactive waste. The two sites under consideration

are Suttsu Town and Kamoenai Village (both in Hokkaido). By February, NUMO plans to hold
explanatory meetings with locals.
•  CONTEXT: Both Muttsu and Kamoenai are considering referendums. In June, Genkai Town (Saga
Pref) became the third site to begin such research.
• TAKEAWAY: The first phase of the selection process, the literature review (which does not involve boring), has
ended. Still, it’s not guaranteed that the reviews will continue to the second phase. Hokkaido’s governor has
reaffirmed the region’s opposition to hosting nuclear waste, saying that an ordinance prohibits its acceptance.

The governor’s opposition is the main challenge for NUMO. But it can move onto the next phase of the review
regardless.



Trina Solar achieves record conversion efficiency in bifacial solar cell
(Company statement, Nov 14)
•  Trina Solar achieved a conversion efficiency of 25.9% with its new bifacial solar cell, setting a world

record.
•  This was verified by ISFH CalTeC (Germany) that specializes in PV research.
•  The cell uses N-type monocrystalline silicon wafers with phosphorus; it has a long minority carrier
lifetime, crucial for improving efficiency.



MOL, KEPCO ink MoU for liquefied hydrogen carrier study
(Company statement, Nov 19)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) and KEPCO signed an MoU to study development of a liquefied
hydrogen carrier. This is Japan’s first collaboration between a shipping company and a power

generator on marine transport of liquefied hydrogen.
•  The study will test optimal vessel designs and operations and assess safety measures.

NEWS:     ELECTRICITY       MARKETS





EGC allows generators to send less surplus power to spot market in light of GHG constraints

(Government statement, Nov 15)
•  The power sector regulator EGC will allow power generation companies to reduce the supply of
surplus power to the spot market in light of state-mandated GHG emission restrictions.
•  CONTEXT: Major utilities claim that the reduction of operations thermal power plants allows them
overall to lower CO2 emissions. However, utilities are obliged to ensure that curtailment of their
thermal power plants doesn’t occur during peak demand and other periods when it can affect
market prices.
• TAKEAWAY: The major utilities (EPCOs) should be selling their surplus power on the spot market at prices

based on marginal costs, as per the Electricity Business Act and agreements with the EGC. In reality, the
EPCOs sometimes squeeze the supply of ‘surplus’ power, resulting in higher market rates. This month, the
EGC filed a business improvement order to JERA on this matter, claiming that the utility withheld surplus
electricity from the spot (day-ahead) market between April 2019 and October 2023. This is clearly inciting
pushback from the EPCOs, and it seems the EGC is willing to allow some leeway, accepting the rationale that
the EPCOs also need to adjust their output based on emissions targets.




Electricity spot market trading volume drops amid regional disparities
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 22)
•  In October, JEPX recorded an average daily trading volume of 656.4 GWh, down 12.2% over
September and the second consecutive monthly decline. Total monthly trading volume was 20.35
TWh, down 9.3% MoM but up 12.8% YoY.
•  Spot prices remained firm despite the volume drop, with the highest observed price nearing ¥40/

kWh, driven by record-high temperatures for October and reduced solar power output due to high
rainfall across the country.
•  Average system prices fell compared to Sept, with the 24-hour average at ¥12.68, the daytime
average at ¥13.24, and the peak average also at ¥13.24. The highest system price was ¥15.98 on
Oct 18, while the lowest was ¥8.25 on Oct 13.
•  Regional price differences persisted, with Tokyo recording the highest average price of ¥15.33.
West Japan’s prices were lower, ranging from ¥10 to ¥11. The highest spot price of ¥39 occurred

on Oct 4 in East Japan during an unseasonal heatwave in Tokyo and constrained solar power
generation.

Chubu Electric secures balancing capacity via special contracts for pumped-storage
(Government statement, various, Nov 21)
•  Chubu Electric Power Grid secured balancing capacity through discretionary contracts for pumped-
storage power generation to address high unmet rates in the weekly balancing market, a move

approved as an "innovative solution" by the EGC.
•  A contract that the grid company made with Chubu Electric Mirai’s pumped-storage units covers
610 MW from July 2024 to March 2025, with costs adjusted to reflect lost market-based profits and
alternative procurement costs.
•  Payments for July-August were lower than market procurement rates, reducing overall balancing
costs.
•  CONTEXT: The grid operator’s solution also highlights balancing market challenges, particularly in

Chubu and other regions, where pumped-storage capacity struggled to meet balancing
requirements due to stringent technical demands.
•  Experts suggest systemic adjustments for fair competition and transparency, with some advocating
that transmission operators directly manage pumped-storage resources for optimal value.
• TAKEAWAY: Pumped storage hydropower plants are Japan’s most important resource to provide balancing
reserves. Since April 2024, however, when all five products started trading on the EPRX (the marketplace for

supply-demand adjustment contracts), the TSOs have faced a real challenge in accessing pumped hydro
capacity. The fact that the grid operator in Chubu has found an acceptable solution is therefore of great
interest both to OCCTO and other TSOs. Expect to see other regions trial similar schemes.



J-Power and partners ink agreement on operation of regional microgrids
(Company statement, Nov 19)
•  Six entities – J-Power, Suzuyo Shoji, Shizuoka Pref, Shizuoka City, Chubu Electric Power Grid and

Suzuyo Electric Power – agreed to establish and operate a regional microgrid in Shizuoka City.
•  Goals include maximizing the use of solar power and integrating energy storage and distributed
generation, and providing a robust backup power source while reducing dependency on a
centralized grid.
•  The Hinode Regional Microgrid (Shizuoka City) will incorporate solar power generation systems,
large-scale battery storage and energy management systems.
•  The microgrids will supply solar-generated electricity to local consumers under PPAs, with battery

systems optimizing energy distribution under normal circumstances. During prolonged outages the
microgrids will disconnect from the main grid to maintain local power supply.
• TAKEAWAY: Shizuoka's energy strategies are largely influenced by its geography and susceptibility to natural
disasters. These challenges have led to efforts to decentralize energy systems and strengthen grid resilience,
such as the Hinode District Microgrid aimed at creating self-reliant power systems that can operate
independently during emergencies. While the Chubu region benefits from interregional power transmission

lines, allowing electricity to flow between regions to balance supply and demand, microgrids are expected to
be more reliant especially during peak demand or emergencies when local generation might be insufficient.
Such initiatives also help expand the use of renewables, particularly solar, given that Shizuoka has a relatively
favorable climate.

TMG plans floating offshore wind power facility near Izu Islands
(Tokyo MX, Nikkei, Nov 13)
•  The Tokyo Metropolitan Govt plans to build a floating offshore wind power facility in the waters
around the Izu Islands, with a capacity of about 1 GW. The plan was announced during COP29 in

Baku.
•  TMG also plans to trial transactions to set up a market for green hydrogen.
•  CONTEXT: The region is noted for its favorable wind conditions.
• TAKEAWAY: Creating floating offshore wind power capacity in the Tokyo Bay would place green electricity in
proximity to an area with high electricity demand and with a well-established grid infrastructure. While floating
wind tech is still in a nascent stage in Japan, it has advantages over fixed-bottom turbines: It allows wind
turbines to be situated in deep waters; and it’s also believed to be more resilient to earthquakes. However,

being close to the world’s largest metropolitan area will bring even more scrutiny to impact on marine
ecosystems, concerns over noise pollution, and logistics in terms of navigating the heavy maritime traffic in
Tokyo Bay. Costs of construction and maintenance are also likely to be higher than elsewhere in the country.



KEPCO to restart Mihama NPP Unit 3

(Company statement, Nov 19)
•  KEPCO will restart Mihama NPP Unit 3; power generation will resume on Nov 21, following
completion of upgrades.
•  CONTEXT: On Oct 10, KEPCO detected thinning and minor perforation in the seawater return
piping; this led to a shutdown on Oct 15. The polyethylene lining that prevents contact with
seawater had come off. The piping was repaired with an epoxy resin lining but system operation
caused it to peel, exposing the pipe's base material to seawater, causing the damage.

Chubu Electric head visits Shizuoka Gov regarding Hamaoka NPP
(Nikkei, Nov 21)
•  Chubu Electric’s president met with the Shizuoka Governor to discuss the Hamaoka NPP
(Omaezaki City), such as the start of compliance reviews for new NRA regulatory standards and

plans to raise the plant's seawall height to 28 meters above sea level. It’s now 22 meters.
•  He explained that an anticipated tsunami height during a potential Nankai Trough earthquake is
25.2 meters above sea level.
• TAKEAWAY: Billed by one geologist as potentially Japan’s most dangerous NPP, due to its proximity to
Tokyo, Hamaoka NPP was shuttered due to political pressure by the government of PM Kan. For a long time,
the station has looked unlikely to ever restart, but after over a decade of upgrades costing hundreds of billions
of yen, the utility feels the public mood has changed. Thus, it began an early dialogue with the governor to

anticipate any opposition.

Onagawa NPP Leads the Return of BWR Reactors in East Japan

In a major milestone for Japan’s nuclear industry, after 13 years of dormancy Tohoku
Electric restarted the No. 2 reactor at Onagawa NPP (825 MW) on October 29. In
addition to bringing more carbon-free capacity online, the event marks the first restart
of a boiling water reactor (BWR), the same type that was in use at Fukushima Daiichi
NPP.

Along with Fukushima, Onagawa NPP was hit hard during the earthquake that shook
the Pacific coastal area of northeast Japan in March 2011. Located close to the
epicenter, Onagawa withstood the earthquake’s full force and a subsequent 13-meter
tsunami. Still, the NPP had to be mothballed.

Onagawa’s restart has sparked hopes that other BWR reactors will soon follow. For
example, Chugoku Electric's Shimane NPP Unit 2 (in Matsue City) has completed
loading nuclear fuel and plans to restart on December 7. Also, TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa Unit 7, also a BWR, has passed regulatory review and awaits local approval.

The restart of these BWR reactors in East Japan lags behind the already restarted
pressurized water reactors (PWRs) in West Japan. The first PWR reactor to restart was
Kyushu Electric’s Sendai NPP Unit 1 in August 2015, followed by Sendai NPP Unit 2 a
few months later. Since then, ten other PWRs have restarted.


The Onagawa restart comes at a critical time for Japan’s energy policy. Despite Prime
Minister Ishiba taking a cool stance on nuclear energy during his recent election
campaign, the new government seems intent on following former PM Kishida’s target
of nuclear power providing 20%-22% of the national power mix by 2030.

That means the number of operating reactors will need to double from the current
level, accounting for just under 8% of the national energy mix.

Map of restarted PWRs (in yellow) and restarted/to be restarted BWRs (in blue).
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP Unit 7 is an Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR).

A boost for Tohoku Electric
Onagawa’s startup marks the 13th reactor to return online since the 2011 Earthquake
hit the region and caused Japan to shut all its nuclear power plants.

In Japan, commercially operating reactors are called light-water reactors, and there
are two types, distinguished by their steam generation systems. BWR is one type, the
other is pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The reactors that restarted earlier (from
2015 to the present) in the Kansai and Kyushu regions are PWRs.

Most inactive reactors in Japan are BWRs, which were given additional tasks by the
sector regulator to upgrade their safety specs in light of the Fukushima accident.

Restarting a nuclear reactor is complex and the number of moving pieces involved is
daunting, with the slightest issue able to force a halt. Just about a week after
Onagawa’s startup, Tohoku Electric detected a malfunction in measuring equipment,
which led to a brief stop in operations. There was no serious incident nor radiation
leakage, and the reactor restarted 10 days later.

Onagawa Unit 2’s restart means that nuclear power will account for almost 10% of the
Tohoku Electric’s total power supply. The utility set a goal of a mix of 15% nuclear,
15% renewable energy, and 70% thermal power by FY2030. In the meantime, Tohoku
Electric is working on safety reviews and applications necessary for the restart of
Higashidori NPP Unit 1 (Aomori Pref) and Onagawa Unit 3.


The restart will also boost Tohoku Electric’s finances, providing a stable base-load
power source for electricity supply in the winter. Tohoku Electric told Japan NRG that
for FY2024, they estimated a reduction in annual fuel expenses by ¥26 billion. For
FY2024, the company forecasts a slight increase in revenue to ¥2.83 trillion but a 43%
19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

drop in net profit to ¥130 billion. For its customers, Tohoku Electric said it was
considering temporary discounts on electricity charges or points for the company’s
point service.

Safety is paramount
Over the past decade, Tohoku Electric has invested heavily in safety improvements at
Onagawa. This included raising the seawall height to 29 meters above sea level, and
seismic reinforcement of equipment, as well as reinforcing the pressure suppression
chamber at the bottom of the containment vessel, which in BWRs is smaller than in a
PWR.

The cost of these upgrades came to about ¥570 billion; and another ¥140 billion will
be invested by December 2026, such as into building a counter-terrorism facility. Also,
Onagawa Unit 2 needs to address spent nuclear fuel storage, as its existing pool is
80% full, and due to hit the 100% level in four years.

The utility might build a dry storage facility on premise, possibly by 2028, and there
are other challenges. Due to the decades-long shutdown, nearly 40% of personnel
lack actual experience working on-site; they’ve only faced simulations and made visits
to other NPPs.

The hefty investment in upgrades has paid off, however. In February 2020, Tohoku
Electric passed an NRA review, and the local community agreed to the restart in
November 2020.


Equipment malfunction
Operations came to a halt on November 3, just a week after the restart. A neutron
measuring device, previously inserted into the reactor, had stopped working, which in
turn led to the company’s decision of suspending the operations in order to
investigate. The malfunctioning equipment is used to calibrate the neutron detectors
inside the reactor and measures the neutrons in the reactor during its operation.
During reactor startup and operation, a calibrating device is inserted into the reactor
via cable. When the calibration device stopped working, it had to remove it.

Immediately after the reactor shut down, Japan NRG reached Tohoku Electric to
understand the status at the Onagawa NPP. Tohoku Electric responded and
confirmed there was no radioactive impact; an internal inspection began the same
day. Still, the company said it could not provide a timeline for resuming the restart.

The second restart
On November 11, Tohoku Electric revealed the cause of the trouble – a loosened nut
at the connection point of the guide pipe used to insert equipment into the reactor; it
caused the guide pipe connection to come apart. The cables became dislodged, were
caught inside the reactor containment vessel, and were unable to move. Tohoku
Electric told Japan NRG that the cable ended up outside the guide tube and got
caught on gratings or other components inside the reactor containment vessel,
making it impossible to pull the cable out using the motorized system.




20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Tohoku Electric had replaced the guide pipe in May, but now suspects that tightening
the nut was insufficient. Oddly enough, the guide pipe probably came apart during
operational checks of the cables.

On November 13, at around 9 a.m., Tohoku Electric restarted the reactor. It reached
criticality shortly before noon. Power generation and transmission began on
November 15 at 6 p.m.. The company still expects the plant to resume commercial
operation by the end of this year. Before that, it will undergo NRA inspection.

After restarting a reactor, output is steadily increased before transitioning to
commercial operation. But in this case, the process will include stopping the reactor
on November 24 after increasing the generator's output to the full capacity of 825
MW, granting extra safety to the restart.

Comments and reactions
Prior to the temporary halt, both the Onagawa mayor and the Miyagi Prefecture
Governor Murai Yoshihiro stressed the importance of this restart after years of
dormancy. Still, even before the hiccup with the measuring equipment became
known, the governor said operations should be halted in case of any issues.


On November 11, after the equipment malfunction, the Miyagi Prefecture’s
Reconstruction and Crisis Management Department issued a stern warning. The
prefecture also requested strict adherence to construction management practices and
recurrence prevention measures. Two days later, the Miyagi Prefecture governor
disclosed the issuance of the warning to Tohoku Electric, stressing how even basic
mistakes should not be overlooked.

Such statements reveal that the restart is proceeding with much wariness. Many in the
Tohoku region retain vivid memories of the 2011 Fukushima accident and oppose
nuclear restarts. On the day of the startup, a group protested in front of Tohoku
Electric’s headquarters, and a lawsuit is in the courts, with residents demanding a halt
to its operation, citing deficiencies in the evacuation plan in case of an accident. The
Sendai High Court will rule later this month.

Others, however, welcome the restart as a boost for the local economy, especially
employment. Also, the company announced temporary discounts on electricity bills in
2025.

Then, there are those in between. The majority of towns in prefectures that host NPPs
that are outside the immediate vicinity of the stations have little to gain from

supporting a restart. When trust in the plant operator is low, as it is currently with
TEPCO, the chance that the prefectural governor gives a green light in the face of
skeptics is slim.

Operators say they’re proceeding with utmost caution, while trying to find a subtle
balance between the technical, economic and political spheres. For TEPCO to follow
the example of Tohoku Electric, it will also need to find a way to rally local support in
a way that has escaped it for the past decade.

Too Much and Yet Not Enough: The CO₂ Conundrum

While many people fret over an excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, parts of
Japan’s industry are gripped by a paradoxical anxiety: a looming CO₂ shortage.

Industrial-grade CO₂ – which is essential for applications ranging from dry ice to
welding, water treatment, and carbonated beverages – is harder to source,
threatening supply chains and raising costs. In a surprising twist, it may also be
complicating one of the potential energy transition pathways, in which CO₂ would be
recycled as ‘net-zero’ synthetic fuels for aviation, marine and auto transport.

Today’s problem stems from the global shuttering of oil refineries, historically the
backbone of CO₂ production. These facilities captured emissions, filtered impurities,
and processed the gas into a valuable feedstock. In Japan, oil refineries and ammonia
plants accounted for 80% of the 0.9 million tons of CO₂ needed annually. Yet over the
past decade, four major refineries have closed in the country, slashing crude oil
processing capacity from 4 million barrels per day to just 3.1 million.

The consequences are stark and perhaps surprising. Japan’s imports of CO₂, once
negligible, have surged, doubling to over 22,000 tons in 2023 and already soaring to
nearly 30,000 tons by September of this year. Prices, too, are climbing. Gas suppliers
have responded with price hikes of 15-30%, further squeezing industries already
grappling with inflation and supply chain disruptions.


In 2023, the average sales price of CO₂ hit ¥24,000 per ton, which is incidentally
about five times the price of carbon offset credits traded in Tokyo, and up from
¥20,000 a decade earlier.













Source: METI

Gas panic
Japan’s CO₂ emissions were 1 billion tons in 2022, excluding other global warming
gases. About 0.9 million tons/ year of CO₂ are captured at factory sites and re-
processed into 99-99.9% high-purity gas. Dry ice is the largest application taking 30-
40% of the industrial-grade CO₂ supplies. Welding of metals, waste water treatment,

23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

petrochemical feedstock, carbonated beverages and agricultural applications
comprise the rest.

In the past decade, Japan’s CO₂ capture has slightly declined, yet demand for the gas
is up. This supply crunch is reshaping the CO₂ value chain.

Traditionally, heavy emitters such as energy and steel companies have led investments
in carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies to offset their emissions. Today,
it is the consumers – food producers, dry ice manufacturers, and chemical firms – who
are scrambling to secure supplies.

The sense of urgency is evident across industries – not just obvious users like
chemicals producer Cosmo Energy. Beverage giants like Asahi Group, food maker
Kagome, and even supermarket chains like Aeon have launched carbon recycling
projects to mitigate their reliance on dwindling domestic supplies. "Consumers, rather
than emitters, are now the driving force of CCU," observes a researcher at the state-
run Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE). The trend, he
adds, reflects a broader global shift as fossil fuels are gradually phased out.

This pivot has also exposed shortcomings in Japan’s regulatory frameworks. In its
2023 Carbon Recycle Roadmap, the government divided CO₂ reuse into two
categories: carbon utilization, where CO₂ is processed into stand-alone products like
dry ice, and carbon recycling, where it is combined with other substances to create
synthetic fuels, e-methane, methanol, or CO₂-storing concrete.


Only recycling qualifies for carbon credits or clean energy certificates, a distinction
that critics argue is arbitrary. After all, synthetic fuels ultimately release CO₂ into the
atmosphere just like traditional utilization processes. For example, if 0.5 tons of CO₂ is
used to produce 15 nm3 of e-methane, when the fuel is consumed, 0.5 tons of CO₂ is
released into the atmosphere, according to one synthetic fuel producer.

From the government’s perspective, however, recycling can be categorized separately
because it leads to the creation of new products and, most importantly, contributes to
the reduction of total national emissions.

To incentivize recycling, the government is planning to count such efforts as “avoided
emissions” by 2025. Officials also acknowledge the need to broaden the scope,
including support for CO₂ derived from non-fossil sources such as biomass and biogas
plants (BECCS), a METI official told Japan NRG. Such non-fossil sources, which include
waste incineration plants, fermentation and biogas plants, will also make CO₂ value
chains cleaner. Yet for now, the rules remain skewed toward heavy emitters, leaving
CO₂ consumers to fend for themselves.

ramping up production, with Resonac commissioning a 30,000-ton-per-year facility in
April 2024. Meanwhile, alternative technologies are emerging. Sharp, for instance, has
introduced a water-based dry ice substitute, while researchers are exploring other
ways to reduce dependence on high-purity CO₂.
Despite these efforts, prices remain high, and may stay that way for the coming
months or years. The upward momentum, however, will eventually weaken as
consumers increase recycling and cut expensive purchases from gas suppliers.
The carbon market will likely face a structural conflict again. The government plan is to
commercialize synthetic fuel production in the 2030s. If this happens, producers of e-
methane and e-fuels will require vast quantities of CO₂ to scale up, but they also need
it to be cheap.
For e-methane to compete with city gas, for example, CO₂ would need to cost less
than ¥3,000 per ton, which is a fraction of today’s prices, said an official from a
company conducting an e-methane pilot project.
This raises several questions: Will prices of high-purity CO₂ come down to ¥2,000-
3,000 per ton, one tenth of what they are today? Will the emission pricing, which is a
framework for a virtual CO₂ price, work for transacting real CO₂? Will a separate
pricing mechanism be required for synthetic fuel-grade CO₂?

The broader implications for climate policy are profound. The CO₂ shortage
underscores the tension between phasing out fossil fuels and ensuring a stable supply
of industrial gases. It also raises questions about the role of carbon in a decarbonized
future.

Once seen purely as a pollutant, CO₂ is now being reimagined as a resource, not only
for industry but potentially for energy, plastics, and other applications. Carbon is still
damaging when it accumulates unchecked in excessive quantities in the atmosphere,
but as its role in society evolves, we may need to rethink our relationship with it.

"Hello carbon, what are you?" might be the question we’ll need to ask. The answer
could redefine not just energy systems but the way we think about the building blocks
of our modern world.

COP29    WRAP-UP,       Week   2

BY JOHN VAROLI

This column again focuses on major developments at COP29 in Baku. Here are some
of the main stories.

1. Azerbaijani President Aliyev fumed against Western fossil fuel critics, saying
his country has faced a “campaign of slander and blackmail” from forces
calling to boycott COP29. He added that his country accounts for less than
1% of global oil and gas production, while the EU governments criticizing
Azerbaijan are purchasing its oil and gas.

2. Through 2035, wealthier countries will provide at least $300 billion annually
to finance the developing world’s energy transition. The money will come
from public finance as well as bilateral and multilateral deals. The deal also
calls on parties to work toward unleashing a total of $1.3 trillion a year, with
most of that difference expected to come through private financing.

3. However, if this financial support for developing countries comes mostly
through market-rate loans or other barely discounted finance, then climate
vulnerable countries might drown in debt, activists say. Many of these
countries already spend more on servicing their debt than on education or
health.

4. The ‘loss and damage’ fund, which was agreed on in 2022 to help countries
respond to the effects of climate change, now has its first director: Ibrahima
Cheikh Diong, a Senegalese-American with a financial development
background. Last week, agreements were signed to allow the fund to start
receiving money.

5. Negotiators worked out a deal to set standards for a centralized carbon
trading market under U.N. auspices. But activists say the rules are not
stringent enough, allowing for an unregulated market that could cause more
havoc than no market at all.

6. Hundreds of lobbyists for industrial agriculture are attending COP29. They
include some of the largest agribusinesses such as PepsiCo, Brazilian
meatpacker JBS, animal pharmaceuticals company Elanco, as well as food
sector trade groups.

7. The Declaration on Green Digital Action, which recognizes the potential of
digital technologies to contribute to climate change mitigation, was signed
by tech companies, governments and industry organizations. The declaration
also acknowledges digital tech’s negative impact, such as the growing
emissions from data centers, AI, and e-waste.

8. The Declaration on Enhanced Climate Action in Tourism and the Multisectoral
Action Declaration for Resilient and Healthy Cities were approved, and a
Declaration on Water for Climate Action was endorsed by almost 50
countries, the COP29 presidency announced.

9. The UK and U.S. will partner to speed up advanced nuclear technologies,
aiming to create an alliance that will pool billions in R&D funds and support
the COP28 commitment to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

10. The Reducing Methane from Organic Waste Declaration was endorsed by 35
countries, including Russia and the U.S. It commits countries to sectoral
methane targets in nationally determined contributions and to design
methane-reduction policies and road maps.
