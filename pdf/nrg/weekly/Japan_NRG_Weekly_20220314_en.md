NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







War in Ukraine and impact on energy:
Japan won’t exit Russia’s Sakhalin II LNG project, fearing impact
(Nikkei, March 13)
•  Mitsui & Co. and Mitsubishi Corporation are maintaining their policy of not exiting the Sakhalin II

LNG project in Far East Russia, even after Shell announced its withdrawal. The Japanese side is
concerned about stable supply and energy security should the trading houses walk away.
•  METI spoke with trading house officials involved in energy, and the views are that a hasty
withdrawal would be dangerous and only benefit Russia and China. METI believes that Sakhalin II is
a very valuable asset.
•  Japan’s government and trading houses have analyzed the risk of withdrawal and concluded that it

will mean having to procure most of the lost volumes on the spot market, which could cost as
much as ¥2 trillion extra and increase power prices.
•  Japan has a similar view on other Russian oil and gas projects, though is very concerned about
criticism from investors and the international community.
•  CONTEXT: Sakhalin II is Russia's first LNG project. Its proximity to Japan means cargos can arrive
within three days, compared with two weeks for LNG ships from the Middle East and three weeks
for U.S. deliveries.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI Minister opposed to Sakhalin withdrawal
(Reuters, March 8)
o  METI minister Hagiuda questioned whether sanctions against Russia’s Sakhalin I and II oil
and gas projects would be effective, saying he was opposed to an immediate withdrawal
from the project.

o  He said withdrawing from the project was one way of punishing Russia, but was worried
that if Japan relinquished its stake in the project, then it’d be acquired by another
country, with the result that Russia wouldn’t suffer.



Power and gas advisors say utilities should limit exposure to spot LNG
(Japan NRG, March 7)
•  METI advisors for the basic power and gas policy working group said utilities should limit exposure
to the LNG spot market in order to increase supply security. They praised the gas utilities that had
locked 70% of supplies under long-term contracts and limited spot exposure to 30%. The contracts
protect Japanese end-users from skyrocketing spot prices and supply crunch, and limited the rise
in power rates. Japanese term buyers have been able to source LNG at less than $15/ MMBtu

while spot prices surged to $60/MMBtu.

•  Before the Ukraine crisis, Japanese buyers were urged to align with the trend to actively engage in
spot trades, but this approach may not be right. One panelist noted that power utilities ’term ratio
was lower than 70%.
•  Procurement strategy review is needed as JOGMEC studies showed that gas supplies are not
expected to increase until 2025 due to a lack of upstream investment, panelists said.

• TAKEAWAY: Experts are divided on the (long vs short) term ratio levels. While one power and gas working
group member said the 70% term ratio was reasonable, during the nuclear sub-committee meeting last week
another panelist criticized the utilities for buying too much from the spot market.
• Long-term contracts do not always guarantee supplies. For example, deliveries can be canceled due to natural

disasters and wars. Familiarity with the quality of spot supplies and fast-changing trade practices could help
buyers cope with force majeure risks.


Government bans export of refining equipment to Russia
(Nikkei, March 8)
•  Japan followed the U.S. with export sanctions on oil refining equipment to Russia.
•  The move is designed to strike a blow to the Russian energy industry, which is an important source

of revenue for Moscow.
•  Along with the U.S. and the EU, Japan expanded the list of Russian individuals and organizations
whose assets would be frozen, including USM Holdings owner Alisher Usmanov.


MHI to develop ammonia-fired system that can be installed at coal plants

(Nikkei, March 12)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will develop a new power system with 200 MW turbines fueled by
ammonia. The system will not emit nitrogen oxide (NOx), a by-product of conventional ammonia
power generation facilities.
•  The system will allow a relatively easy conversion of existing coal plants to burning ammonia.
•  The new turbines MHI will utilize part of the waste heat generated when ammonia is burned at 600
degrees, splitting into nitrogen and hydrogen. The latter will be recycled to power the gas

turbine, while the heat will be used to break down ammonia.
•  The new system will be commercially available in the 2030s, and is expected to cost 1/10th of the
amount needed to install new hydrogen turbines.
• TAKEAWAY: This could be a major R&D breakthrough if the parameters suggested at this moment hold up in
testing facilities. The major problems of hydrogen-fired power have always been cost and difficulty in
transportation.The major problems for ammonia as a power fuel have included supply and NOx emissions.
MHI’s system seems to offer a solution, and allows a more straightforward shift from coal to clean-burning gas

at thermal plants than the current co-firing strategy.
• Still, this system will only be available a decade from now, which leaves time for other, more market-ready
technologies to take market share.

• Another encouraging factor is MHI’s claim that it could make smaller ammonia-fired turbines commercially
available as soon as 2025. That would allow factories with captive coal-fired power plants to start making the
switch already this decade.

Agriculture Ministry to subsidize farmers and wood processors to use less fuel
(New Energy Business News, March 8)
•  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) decided at the "Ministerial
Meeting around Soaring Oil Prices" to introduce emergency measures to help farmers.
•  Among these, the ministry will expand support for mushroom farmers who wish to install wood

biomass boilers and wood processing companies that seek to add energy-saving
equipment. Subsidies will support a switch to electric equipment when it contributes to energy
saving.
•  CONTEXT: Using woody biomass reduces the need to burn fuel oil.
•  The government will also provide interest rates subsidies.



Japan, Philippines to combat hydrofluorocarbon under JCM framework
(Japan NRG, March 8)
•  The environment ministries of Japan and the Philippines agreed to step up the joint fight against
hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) by assessing its collection and destruction under the Joint Credit
Mechanism framework.


Japan begins first trials of tidal generation in southwest seas

(NNN News, March 9)
•  In a first, Japan began trialing tidal generation technology in the Nagasaki area. The Naruseto
Strait (奈留瀬戸) lies between Narusejima and Kugajima islands, west of Kyushu.
•  The location was chosen because it has currents of over 3 meters per second. Tidal generation
systems require currents of at least 1 m/s to generate electricity.
•  The electricity generated is brought onshore by a 2 km undersea cable.

•  The government partners with Kyushu Electric on the trial; it wants people to understand the
potential of tidal generation.
•  The output of tidal generation systems is more predictable than other renewables.
•  There are a total of six straits in the Nagasaki region suitable for tidal generation.



Kawasaki Heavy says test shipment of liquid hydrogen from Australia is a success
(Reuters, March 8)
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) and other Japan-based firms said that a pilot project to transport
hydrogen produced from brown coal in Australia, carried in the world’s first liquefied hydrogen
tanker, had proven technically feasible.
•  The A$500 million ($364 million) project, led by KHI and backed by the governments of Japan and

Australia in an effort to cut carbon emissions, was originally due to ship its first cargo a year ago
but was delayed by the pandemic.
•  The KHI-built Suiso Frontier tanker left Australia on Jan. 25 and arrived in Kobe, Japan, a month
later. The hydrogen cargo was unloaded by the end of February.
•  J-Power is in charge of producing the hydrogen for this project. Other partners include Shell,
Iwatani Corp, Marubeni, Eneos and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha.

Petronas and Japan’s ENEOS to jointly study hydrogen production in Malaysia
(Company Statement, March 11)
•  Petronas and ENEOS signed a joint feasibility study agreement to advance studies for a
commercial hydrogen production and conversion project in Kerteh, Terengganu (Malaysia).
•  The two will study the potential for low carbon hydrogen from PETRONAS’ existing

facilities, the production of green hydrogen from a new hydro-powered electrolyser facility, and
hydrogen conversion into methylcyclohexane (MCH).
•  The facilities are projected to have a total hydrogen production and conversion capacity of up to
50,000 tons per annum by 2027 for export in MCH form to Japan, where the hydrogen will be
distributed to Japanese industries through ENEOS’ refineries.
•  Once onstream, the project could potentially be the first commercial scale hydrogen-to-MCH

undertaking in the world. A Final Investment Decision is expected by the end of 2023.


Companies join to make hydrogen from cow dung

(New Energy Business News, March 11)
•  Industrial gases producer, Air Water Hokkaido, and construction major Kajima Corp. established a
JV to produce and sell hydrogen made from biogas derived from livestock manure. This will be
Japan’s first such project manufacturing carbon-neutral hydrogen.
•  The venture, Shikai Hydrogen Farm, will operate in Hokkaido’s Kawato region. It will make
hydrogen for fuel cells to power vehicles and forklift trucks, as well as be transported in high-
pressure containers to the town of Kaoi. Also, it will be packaged into fuel cells, and supplied to

local factories for industrial use.
•  Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm will get biogas produced through methane fermentation from the Shikaoi
Environmental Conservation Center, one of the leading livestock manure processing facilities in
Japan. This hydrogen production supply chain had been jointly tested by Air Water and Kajima
since 2015.



Oil refiner Cosmo and Iwatani Corp partner in hydrogen service stations
(New Energy Business News, March 10)
•  Cosmo Energy Holdings and Iwatani Corporation will collaborate in the hydrogen business. The
two will review the potential to work together in the hydrogen refueling stations sector and
engineering fields related to hydrogen production, as well as in operation of domestic receiving

terminals.
•  A JV focused on building and operating hydrogen service stations that targets fuel cell vehicles will
be set up in 2022.
•  CONTEXT: Cosmo uses hydrogen in the manufacturing process of petroleum products, while
Iwatani is Japan’s leader in hydrogen production.

NEWS:     POWER      MARKETS






OPINION: 11 years after Fukushima, Japan remains unsure on nuclear
(Mainichi Shimbun, March 11)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by Oka Daisuke, an energy policy writer with the daily.
•  The nation’s energy plan was revised for the first time in three years, but state nuclear policy
remained essentially unchanged. PM Kishida’s green energy strategy focuses on renewables and
ammonia, and ignores nuclear.
•  While nuclear energy supplied 25% of Japan’s electricity before Fukushima in 2011, this fell to just

4% in 2020. Nuclear is no longer a major power source.
•  Some hoped the government’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050 would see new reactors
built. But unlike the U.S. and France, which recently announced additional support for nuclear,
Japan has yet to make such commitments.
•  The government will find it hard to achieve its target of sourcing 20% of electricity from nuclear
power stations by 2030.
•  The government puts more hope in renewables. But, the increasing difficulty in finding new sites

for solar farms suggests this target will also be difficult to achieve.
•  The main question is: Can Japanese learn from Fukushima, move on, and agree on a new nuclear
energy policy.



Kansai Electric shuts a reactor at the Ooi NPP for maintenance
(Jiji Press, March 9)
•  Kansai Electric and the Fukui Prefecture said the Ooi Nuclear Power Plant Unit No. 4 will stop
operation on March 11 and begin scheduled inspection and maintenance.
•  The unit is due back online in about four months, in early August.
•  The operator needs to upgrade the reactor to meet the latest anti-terrorism measures by Aug. 24

in order to continue operating. The company is confident it can meet this target.


Record low bids in latest solar FIT tender

(Smart Japan, March 8)
•  Bids in the 11th round of solar energy tenders under the FIT were announced.
•  Bids were accepted from solar facility operators with output of at least 250 kW.
•  A record low bid of ¥8.99/ kWh was noted; average of all bids was ¥9.99/ kWh.
•  While the government held tenders for a total of over 278 MW of capacity, bids received were less
than 269 MW, a drop of over 60 MW compared to the last round.
• TAKEAWAY: This is the first time when the average bids have dropped below ¥10/ kWh, which shows that at

least for now solar prices continue to decline. While this is a testament to how hard the solar industry has
fought to bring down costs, one concern will be what happens once the rising raw material prices start to filter

into the calculations. It’s notable that the number of bidders and total capacity sought by participants has
dropped, suggesting that further price declines will likely see a thinning of the number of industry players.


Wind Industry makes recommendations to government on future offshore wind auctions
(New Energy Business News, March 9)
•  CONTEXT: Japan held its first commercial offshore wind tenders last year. The three areas for

bottom-fixed turbines were all won by Mitsubishi Corporation and a unit of Chubu Electric group,
which stirred up discontent among other wind industry players.
•  The Japan Wind Power Association (JWPA), the industry’s biggest group, sent the
government recommendations for future offshore wind tenders. The JWPA called
for better information disclosure, saying many of its members are unsure as to how the
government carried out its evaluation of bids.
•  The JWPA also raised concerns that the government is allocating too much weight to the price

offered by bidders, saying it does not fully value efforts put into working with the local
communities. The industry lobby group said this could “hinder industrial development and supply
chain construction.”
•  The group wants its recommendations to be in place for the next offshore wind auction, for
the Happo Town and Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture, the bidding for which has already started.
• TAKEAWAY: Companies that put in years of work into building local relationships in the towns close to

offshore wind projects are trying to swing the balance to their favor. That’s not to say Mitsubishi and its allies
do not have cache in the regions. But, clearly some of their rivals clearly spent more resources on speaking
with the local population and businesses. Since the government has often emphasized the need to “sell”
renewables projects to the local communities, it can’t ignore such pleas from industry groups.



Ibaraki wind farm to be completed over a year early

(Nikkei, March 11)
•  Ibaraki-based Wind Power Energy said a 160 MW offshore wind farm planned for Kajima port,
Ibaraki, is now scheduled to begin feeding the grid in 2026/27.
•  Completion was originally scheduled for 2028.
•  The faster turnaround was made possible by a quicker environmental assessment.



Shipper Mitsui OSK to join Taiwan offshore wind project led by Orsted
(Kankyo Business, March 7)
•  Shipping firm Mitsui O.S.K. (MOL) will join the 128 MW Formosa I offshore wind power project in
Taiwan. The shipper will take over the shares in the project held by Australia’s Macquarie group.
•  Mitsui OSK will take a 37.5% stake in a JV with Toho Gas and Hokuriku Electric. That venture owns

25% of the operating firm for Formosa I.
•  The shipper also announced the establishment of a ¥10 billion fund together with Hokutaku, a
Hokkaido company specializing in wind power equipment maintenance, in order to invest in
offshore wind power generation projects in Japan.
•  Mitsui OSK seeks to become a leader in floating offshore wind, a field in which it can use its
experience with floating production and storage units, or floating storage and regassification units.

(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, March 11)
o  Osaka Gas President Fujiwara said there’s no energy company that won’t be affected if
all Russian natural gas is embargoed, adding that it will lead to even higher oil prices and
physical shortages.
o  Oil at above $100 per barrel will hurt Osaka Gas income by about ¥4 billion next year.
o  Osaka Gas procures only 4%, or 380,000 tons, of its LNG from Russia and could find

alternative suppliers, Fujiwara aid.

As Ukraine Conflict Spurs Energy Upheaval
Nuclear Policy Debate Reignites

Russia’s sudden and unexpected offensive against Ukraine is forcing a dramatic
change in energy policy across the globe. Governments are trying to increase crude
oil stockpiles and reviewing power supply chains, as well as trying to find ways to
mitigate the fallout from rising energy prices that are incensing electorates.

The upheaval threatens to spill into political changes as a number of major
industrialized nations, Japan included, face key elections this year. PM Kishida’s
administration is trying to forestall popular anger by addressing self-sufficiency in key
sectors — semiconductors, rare earths, food, and, of course, energy.

Toward that goal of energy self-sufficiency, the issue of nuclear power is once again
front and center. Recent METI meetings with external advisors have ended with calls
to increase nuclear power’s role in the energy mix. But METI will have to work hard to
mitigate negative public sentiment towards the industry that lingers 11 years on from
the Fukushima disaster.

In the midst of the highest inflation in decades, power utilities and METI are making
the case for more restarts by arguing that nuclear plants can help to reign in rising
electricity rates and avoid CO2 emissions that would be incurred were thermal plants
to take their place. The pro-nuclear lobby, however, remains deeply divided on
energy security definitions and dimensions.

While Japan hesitates over its next steps, it’s clear that more and more of the
industrialized world is ready to back the nuclear bandwagon. Neighbors in Asia are
starting to look more into nuclear technologies, which in itself presents tremendous
export opportunities for Japan since it produces components used in advanced
nuclear reactors.


Background: energy vulnerability
In 2019, Japan’s energy self-sufficiency was 12.1%, far below the 2010 figure of
20.2%. The decline’s main cause was the closure of nuclear power stations following
the 2011 accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi station. In its heyday, nuclear accounted
for a third of the nation’s power mix; by 2019 that figure was 4%.

Since 2011, coal and gas stepped in to fill the gap, but net-zero policies enacted over
the last two years and surging fossil fuel prices mean it has come time for a change.
Tokyo will have to make hard and possibly unpopular decisions that will determine
energy policy for decades to come. Failure to act would leave Japan vulnerable to
power outages.


Russia pivot was Plan B
For decades, reducing Middle East energy dependency has been a top priority. And
so, since the end of the Cold War, Russia has been seen as a source of energy supply
to fall back on in case Middle Eastern sources failed.

While Saudi Arabia and UAE still account for over 70% of Japan’s oil imports, Russia’s
oil import share is 4% and LNG 9%. While that might seem small and easily
replaceable, Japanese experts warn the government not to give up on Russian
supplies as the volatile Middle East region too could erupt in conflict. It has seen
several major wars over the past three decades.

Ironically, the effort to reduce exposure to Middle East oil has turned into a major
geopolitical risk. Russia is now that risk. Japan’s energy sector will have to digest the
shock from decades of building up alternative supply channels aimed at improving
national energy security.

“You could say that Russian gas has only a 9% share of Japanese imports and can be
replaced. No, the issue is not swapping the origins of gas supply. Japanese firms have
invested heavily into gas supply infrastructure [there] and that’s a big problem,”
Kikkawa Takeo, a veteran METI energy advisor, told the ministry’s power and gas
working group this month.

In addition to external challenges, METI is aware that there’s risk from within: chronic
power shortages. In recent years, Japan’s business industrial areas have had to
grapple with shortages in power capacity every winter and summer. A month ago, for
example, private companies were yet again asked to turn on their generators in order
to help supply the Tokyo area.

This situation cannot continue, and so the logical question arises: How to build new
energy capacity quickly? In Japan’s case, the fastest technical solution would be to
bring back online unused capacity. The nuclear sector offers the biggest untapped
reserves: there are 33 reactors deemed to be operable, yet only five are online today.
In total, 10 units have approval from both the regulator and the local authorities.

The problem is, Japan’s restart process is far from straightforward. Although the
Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) has already approved 17 reactors for restart and is
reviewing a further 8, some facilities have been subject to the checks for nine years
now. Meanwhile, the permit from the NRA is no guarantee of the social license from
the local authorities, without which traditionally no reactor can restart operations.
Which brings us back to public opinion.

Apart from them, there are three more units classified as “under construction,” but in
reality frozen in time by the Fukushima accident, the Japanese reactor fleet is aging.

By 2030, 26% of Japan’s nuclear capacity will be 60-years old, the current limit at

which a nuclear facility can be operated. Even that requires a 20-year extension permit
on top of the original 40-year licensing term. As reactors age, more upgrades and
parts replacements are often required.

Nuclear power’s potential
METI is touting other aspects of the nuclear industry’s growth potential. During a
nuclear panel meeting on Feb. 24, it highlighted the self-sufficiency of the industry.
While Japan imports uranium for nuclear fuel, that fuel could be recycled and reused
under certain conditions.

Also, over 89% of components at Japanese nuclear plants built after 1975 are sourced
locally. Despite all the post-Fukushima problems, Japan remains a leading nuclear
R&D center. Hence, METI’s other sales pitch is that Japan’s export opportunities for
advanced nuclear technologies are growing as countries, including those that don’t
yet have nuclear plants, consider building reactors.

As developing economies seek to replace coal power with nuclear, the global nuclear
plant market will quadruple to $400 billion by 2045, from the current $100 billion, says
the IAEA and U.S. Nuclear Energy Institute.

Among the most promising advanced nuclear technologies are small modular reactors
(SMR), high temperature gas reactors, and fast-neuron reactors. On Jan. 26, U.S.-
based TerraPower — founded by Bill Gates, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi FBR Systems — signed an MoU to jointly develop
sodium-cooled fast reactors. A formal agreement is expected in the coming weeks.

Also, last year, Japan’s JGC and IHI acquired shares of NuScale, a U.S. SMR project
operator. “U.S. needs Japan’s support since it lacks components supply,” METI said.

Taking all the above into account, there’s reason to believe that Japan’s energy
security is not as vulnerable as one might think. The main problem is more a lack of
decisiveness at the top to make a firm decision either way and carry it out. The amebic
process of restarting existing nuclear plants is a case in point.

While it’s true that Japan’s decentralized system of government limits how much PM
Kishida can enforce, setting a clear national course will build momentum and help
local authorities to rally around it.

The easiest thing is to do nothing. But if that persists, PM Kishida’s ruling party could
face a summer upper house election in which energy inflation eroding household
incomes – which he vowed to protect as he came into office in October 2021 – will
become his political undoing.

ANALYSIS

BY YURIY HUMBER

The Cost of Breaking Energy Ties with Russia

While the U.S. and Europe announced major pullbacks from trade and investment in
Russian energy, both on a national and corporate level, so far Japan resists this course
of action.

Beyond geopolitical consequences, an unequivocal stand on Russian energy trade will
incur major economic costs for Japan, which could possibly run into tens of billions of
dollars. It may also unintentionally disrupt European allies’ efforts to reduce their own
reliance on Russia for energy commodities.

PM Kishida’s administration seems unconvinced that a pullout from all energy projects
in Russia and the termination of purchases of that country’s commodities would have a
significant impact on President Putin – especially in terms of curtailing the war in
Ukraine. Meanwhile, pressure from the U.S., EU or the G7 for Tokyo to take a hard line
on Russian energy is not forthcoming due to issues closer to home.

Severe disruptions to the system of payments and global logistics could yet see Japan
notably reduce Russian commodity imports. Yet, the concern in Tokyo is not only
about the large cost to its own economy. Mid to long-term, this might strengthen
China’s economy and energy security, creating a possible trigger for future
disruptions.


Silver lining?
Last week, the U.S. announced a ban on imports of Russian oil and natural gas. The
reaction from Japan’s PM was diplomatic: “President Biden is proceeding with this
measure with the understanding that many of our allies are not in a position to
participate.”

As Kono Taro, Kishida’s rival in the ruling party leadership election last year,
summarized in a tweet: “Japan’s dependence of energy imports on Russia is oil 4%,
LNG 9%, coal 11%; whereas the U.S. — 2%, 0%, 0%, accordingly.” While Kishida
hinted Japan doesn’t feel obliged to follow the U.S., he stressed the importance of
securing stable energy supplies. This could significantly impact the LNG market.

Last week’s EU announcement of a strategy to reduce dependence on Russian energy
includes procuring additional imports of 50 bcm of natural gas a year via LNG imports.
Some of the EU’s desired volumes may come as part of long-term deals with
suppliers, but new global LNG capacity due online this year falls short of EU needs.

The Europeans will have to outbid Asian peers for the same limited number of cargos.
It will push up the global price of LNG without immediately delivering more volumes,
instigating a race to see which economy is the first to accept shortages and
curtailments of industry.

In addition, this will price developing Asian economies, such as India and Bangladesh,

out of the LNG market, leaving them to burn more coal and oil.


Cost of decoupling from Russian energy
By retaining investments in Russian oil and gas projects, Japan minimizes the need to
go into the LNG spot market to secure additional supplies. If companies like Mitsui &
Co., Mitsubishi Corp., JOGMEC and others pull out, then Japan would need to
replace the 6.57 million tons of Russian LNG from elsewhere.

Japan’s investments are essentially guarantees for long-term supply contracts, and it
would be inconceivable for Japanese firms to sell out of Russian oil and gas ventures
but retain the LNG supplies.

Last year, Japan paid about ¥56,678/ ton of Russian LNG, which translates into about
$9.74 per MMBtu. This is slightly less than the $9.86/ MMBtu that Japan paid for all of
the LNG it imported in 2021.

Were Japan to secure the Russian 2021 volumes in the global market today, it would
need to sign new long-term contracts or buy on the spot market. Either way, this
would at least double the cost compared to last year. Asia’s JKM benchmark for LNG
jumped to around $85 earlier this month, according to Bloomberg.

Assuming that Japan secured replacement for Russian volumes at $40 on average, it
would need to pay close to $10 billion on top of its spending on Russian LNG last
year.

The same calculation with coal – buying Russian volumes elsewhere at January 2022
prices, which are about 43% higher than the average that Japan paid for its imports in
2021 – means paying about $1.2 billion more.

Since LNG and coal make up about two-thirds of the country’s electricity mix, these
premiums would translate into power prices. Electricity costs for consumers in Japan
were 13.5% higher in January than a year earlier, while petroleum goods, including
gasoline, were up 20.3% in the same period, according to government data.

For March 1-10, spot electricity prices on the JEPX wholesale market averaged ¥26/
kWh. That’s 30% higher than the February average and double that of six months ago.

A METI assessment of 2020 power generation costs indicated that LNG fuel amounts
to about 60% of the electricity cost at a gas-fired power plant. In that year, the price
Japan paid for imports of LNG averaged just $7.61/ MMBtu. Without long-term
contracts to reign in the inflation in LNG costs, Japan’s power market would spike.
Russian LNG volumes accounted for 9% of Japan’s total imports last year, but rose to
11.5% for January 2022.

For PM Kishida, who heads into Upper House elections in June on a platform to
spread income equality, allowing a drastic price rise in gasoline, diesel, and electricity
would be political suicide. In January, Japan’s core inflation was just 0.5%. But the
more telling wholesale price index, which tracks the prices businesses pay each other,
saw a 9.3% jump in February, a 12th straight increase and the fastest rate since 1981.

Any move, corporate or geopolitical, that causes further inflation will be vetoed by the
national government, which has few options to dampen energy prices. The rollout of
new renewables capacity faces land constraints and grid bottlenecks. The national
government has little direct control over nuclear reactor restarts. And energy rationing
ahead of a major election, especially after a pandemic-hit two years, is seen as the
very last resort.

What’s the upside?
Just as fuel costs feed into electricity prices, so the latter feed into the cost of
products and services, and this is where Japan’s concerns become particularly strong.
The country already famously has among the world’s highest power costs. Should its
Russian LNG and coal volumes be lost, they will likely go to China, giving Chinese
manufacturers a more secure and low-cost energy base.
Answering questions in parliament, METI minister Hagiuda summarized the
government’s concerns in plain terms: “Our main concern is whether a third country
might immediately take over [Japanese] investments. If Russia doesn’t feel the pain
from sanctions, then it would be pointless.”

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Wind and solar power
The Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park secured approval from the Australian
Energy Market Operator and will soon begin production. Owned by Spanish
renewable energy firm Iberdrola, this 317 MW project is Australia’s largest hybrid wind
and solar farm.

Barbados/ Fossil fuels
Prime Minister Mia Mottley defended fossil fuel exploration off the island’s coast,
insisting that oil and gas revenue is needed to finance the clean energy transition.
Speaking at a Financial Times’ climate conference, she said zero emissions “doesn’t
mean zero fossil fuels.”

Canada/ Fossil fuels
The state will end financing for an expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline that
carries oil in western Canada. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial
Analysis says costs soared 70% in two years. Taxpayers paid $17 billion; and $8.8
billion is needed for completion. This $26 billion could have been used for
renewables, adding 15 GW to Canada’s power mix, says the IEEFA.
China/ Battery storage
The National Energy Administration said that in 2021 battery production output for
energy storage grew 146%. By 2025, China wants a non-hydro energy storage
capacity of 30 GW. This is part of efforts to boost renewable power consumption and
ensure grid stability.

EU/ Natural gas
Fossil fuel supplies from Russia will be slashed by two-thirds, or 100 bcm. Russia
currently accounts for about 45% of total EU gas imports. The “REPowerEU” plan also
calls for diversifying natural gas supply, and increasing renewable energy generation.

Germany/ Gas pipeline
The cancelled Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline will leave Germany’s Uniper with a €1
billion loss. This include €695 million in loans to Nord Stream 2, and €292 million in
accrued interest payments. Also, there’ll be an annual loss of €100 million as Uniper
forgoes future interest payments.

Ghana/ Solar power
Huawei Digital Power agreed with Meinergy to develop 1 GW of solar generation and
500 MWh of battery storage. Meinergy is a developer of projects in mining and solar
PV. The project will be Africa’s largest solar PV and energy storage system. Currently,
hydroelectric resources provide over 40% of Ghana’s electricity; the remainder is
thermal generation.

India/ Coal

By 2025, the world’s largest coal-producer, Coal India, wants operations to reach net
zero by switching to renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. However, this
goal won’t extend to GHGs from burning the coal the company produces. India has
about170 coal-fired power stations, accounting for about 75% of the country’s
electricity generation.

Italy/ Wind power
As part of plans to reduce Russian gas imports, the government approved
construction of six wind farms with a capacity of 418 MW. The parks will be located in
the central and southern regions. Wind power currently accounts for about 7% of
Italy’s energy mix.

Northeast Asia/ Gas prices
Spot benchmark Japan-Korea LNG prices hit a record high. April cargoes surged to
$84.762 MMBtu on March 7, said S&P Global Platts, up from $47.297 on March 4. The
record price is the equivalent of $492 a barrel of oil. Russia exported about 11.5
million tons of LNG to the Asia- Pacific last year, or 3% of total regional demand.

UK/ Nuclear power
The government asked the nuclear regulator to start the approval process for Rolls-
Royce's small-scale modular nuclear reactor (SMR) that can cut fossil fuels dependence
and GHGs. Britain last year earmarked $546 million to fund development of the
country's first SMR.

U.S./ Green hydrogen
Green Hydrogen International (GHI) plans to create a green hydrogen hub in Texas.
When completed it will be powered by 60 GW of solar and wind energy, making over
2.5 billion kilos of green hydrogen per year. Dubbed Hydrogen City, the project will
be built in different areas. The first will be operational in 2026, and have 2 GW of
production and two storage caverns.
