METI to increase Green Innovation Fund to meet unexpected R&D cost rises

(Government statement, April 4)
•  METI plans to increase the Green Innovation Fund allocation to meet unexpected R&D cost
increases for the projects it supports.
•  The ¥300 billion reserve, set aside for emergencies, will be reduced to ¥100 billion; while the
remaining ¥200 billion will be spent for project funding.
•  The fund is ¥2.76 trillion, and ¥2.27 trillion has already been allocated to projects. The balance will
be for future projects such as hydrogen co-firing in gas turbines.

•  From this fiscal year, companies applying must disclose 2025 and 2030 Scope 1 and 2 emission
reduction goals, and to show roadmaps to cut Scope 3 emissions.
•  CONTEXT: In 2020, METI set up the Green Innovation Fund with ¥2 trillion, assigning its
management to the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).
GIF provides 10 years of continuous support to business-led decarbonization initiatives, ranging
from R&D and demonstration to full implementation, with specific goals shared between the public
and private sectors.

• TAKEAWAY: As a key program in Japan’s efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050, bolstering the Green
Innovation Fund is crucial in the face of rising costs. Most of the technology needed to make the broader
energy transition succeed are still in R&D phase; hence, such funding from METI and other government
agencies will prove to be crucial.




ANRE wants answers from JWD on the results of its compliance review

(Government statement, April 2)
•  METI has asked Japan Wind Development to file a report on its initiatives to improve compliance.
This followed JWD submitting a report to ANRE on March 6 that assesses the causes of violations
by its former president Tsukawaki Masayuki.
•  METI also asked JWD to report whether an investigation committee looking into its case involving
bribery found whether there were any other cases of concern in terms of compliance with laws and
regulations.
•  CONTEXT: In October 2023, ANRE requested scandal-tainted JWD to provide neutral and

objective verification of its legal compliance measures and compliance system in the
implementation of power generation projects. In the same statement, METI reported that the
agency also asked the Japan Wind Power Association to involve a third-party to review decision-
making and activities of the association.
•  CONTEXT: To expand JWD’s wind business, Tsukawaki provided illegal financial contributions to
lawmaker Akimoto Masatoshi to change national wind auction rules. Akimoto has denied the
allegations.

• TAKEAWAY: Neither JWD, its new parent company Infroneer Holdings, nor METI have disclosed the
compliance review reports to date. In comparison, Kansai Electric (KEPCO) has fully disclosed on its website
various compliance reports related to the Takahama town bribery case, as well as the names of the external
parties conducting the probes. In late 2019, accusations came to light that a former deputy mayor of
Takahama town, which hosts one of KEPCO’s nuclear plants, had been bribing company executives for almost

three decades.




Japan to conduct field tests for hydrogen production using nuclear power
(Nikkei Asia, April 4)
•  In 2028, Japan plans field tests for hydrogen production fueled by nuclear power. This comes after
a successful safety test of the High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) last month.
•  The generated heat will produce so-called ‘pink hydrogen’. But the HTTR has limited output and
needs many units for scalability.

•  Japan plans funds for advanced nuclear reactor development. Yet, there’s skepticism over waste
disposal.
•  CONTEXT: After a period of little activity, HTTR technology is now advancing. Japan’s successful
test in late March was the second in the world, after those in China.
• TAKEAWAY: Hydrogen produced by nuclear power is referred to as ‘pink hydrogen’. Its main advantage is
potentially lower hydrogen production costs with a stable, non-CO2-emitting power source. But it’s still too
early to judge how this will compete with hydrogen produced using natural gas (‘blue hydrogen’) or renewable

energy (‘green hydrogen’).




Japan-U.S.-Philippines summit to address nickel and regional security issues
(Nikkei Asia, April 1)
•  In the first trilateral summit in Washington on April 11, President Biden, PM Kishida and President
Marcos Jr will discuss nickel supplies from the Philippines.
•  The Philippines seeks a free trade pact with the U.S. to make its nickel eligible for Inflation

Reduction Act subsidies.
•  CONTEXT: U.S. nickel imports from the Philippines are marginal, but strengthening economic ties
is a part of U.S. regional security plans. The IRA application on nickel from the Philippines will
benefit Japanese companies that run battery plants in the U.S. After China, Japan is the second
largest consumer of Philippine nickel.
• TAKEAWAY: The Philippines produces battery-grade nickel that’s been used for Toyota’s hybrid vehicles for
decades. The IRA would incentivize stakeholders to improve trade, but it would also depend on the type of

nickel products the U.S. will include in the IRA framework. Since the U.S. has no nickel processing plants, it
can’t utilize Philippine nickel ore directly.

o  Japan, the U.S. and the Philippines will cooperate in areas such as semiconductors,
digitalization, communication networks, clean energy and critical minerals, PM Kishida
told Nikkei ahead of a three-way summit in Washington next week.
o  "We need the U.S. to remain engaged in the Asia-Pacific region," Kishida said. "We also
face the reality that China is increasing its presence in the region."
o  CONTEXT: Japan has been closely aligned with the U.S. for decades but the Philippines

move closer to Washington, and away from China, is a more recent development. Kishida
will hold separate talks with Biden the day before.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

TOTE Services began feasibility studies of ammonia ship-to-ship bunkering at the Port of

Oakland, Benicia and other ports in the U.S. West Coast.
o  The studies include safety assessment of ammonia as a marine fuel.



Tokuyama begins production of magnesium for hydrogen storage

(Japan NRG, April 3)
•  Tokuyama launched production of magnesium hydride tablets that absorb and store hydrogen.
The output capacity is 30 tons / year.
•  The tablet, sized 72 x 72 x 18 mm, captures up to 75 kg/m3 of hydrogen. The tablet size inflates by
10% after absorbing the gas.
•  CONTEXT: Various metal hydrides, ranging from aluminum to nickel alloys, have been developed
to store hydrogen at room temperature. But, this requires capital investments: equipment to

capture hydrogen into the metal, a separate device to retrieve the gas, and a hydrogen refining
system capable of attaining over 99.99% purity, are required.
• TAKEAWAY: The hydrogen-contained magnesium tablets are light enough to be hand carried, but the other
equipment is not. Tokuyama says its product accommodates 90%-purity hydrogen, but the storage capacity
declines as a result.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
J-Power, Yamna ink MoU on green hydrogen, ammonia investments
(Company statement, April 2)
o  J-Power and UK-based hydrogen project developer YamnaCo inked a MoU to develop
green hydrogen and ammonia projects globally.

o  The projects will be from Yamna’s pipelines; additional ones to be jointly developed.

•  Panasonic Energy began talks with Indian Oil Corp to form a JV to produce cylindrical lithium-ion
batteries.
•  They’ll conduct a feasibility study on the use of battery tech, hoping to finalize details on
collaboration by summer.
•  CONTEXT: India anticipates a significant increase in demand for batteries for two- and three-wheel
vehicles and energy storage systems. IndianOil is the country’s largest state-owned oil production

firm and has set a net-zero goal by 2046.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Renewables capacity under FIP system rose 150% from Oct to Feb: METI

(Government statement, March 27)
•  Renewables generation capacity under the Feed-in-Premium (FIP) system increased by 150% from
October 2023 through late February, METI said.
•  Certified capacity under the FIP of both new FIP projects and existing ones that shifted from the
Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) totaled 1.507 GW.
•  Meanwhile, the number of newly certified renewables projects under the FIP rose 3.8 fold between
October and February.
•  In October, the total capacity stood at 986 MW, with 275 certified projects.

•  The highest number of both new and existing projects were for PV power, but the data also
showed an increasing trend in the use of hydro under new certifications, and biomass power in
projects shifting from FIT to FIP (details below).
•  CONTEXT: The Feed-in-Premium scheme was introduced in 2022 to offer financial support to
renewables producers as an evolution of the FIT scheme. Under FIP, generators sell electricity to
the market, as opposed to the fixed price guaranteed under the FIT.

• TAKEAWAY: The number of renewables projects (excluding PV for housing) still operating under FIT was
753,543, with a total capacity of 94.7 MW. The number of projects under the FIT reflect their smaller scale as
only those PV installations that are under 50 kW are still eligible for the FIT certification. Still, the increase in FIP
certifications reflects the market’s growing acceptance that it needs to adapt to the new system to continue
developments.

Closures and bankruptcies among new electric power firms up 7-fold
(Company statement, March 28)
•  Research by Teikoku Databank found that as of March 15 a total of 119 new electric power firms
left the market or went bankrupt; that’s 43.3% up from the previous year.
•  The number rose sevenfold from March 2022 and accounts for 20% of a total of 706 new electric
power firms registered in April 2021.

•  In March, as many as 69 new firms cancelled new contracts, down 38.4% YoY.
•  CONTEXT: New power companies (the shin denryoku) tend to offer customers lower rates than
major power utilities EPCOs. That worked as a strategy in the first few years after market
liberalisation but came unstuck as prices surged in recent years and grew more volatile. Today,
new entrants are in a situation where they need to raise prices or adjust their plans to market rates.




EPRX launches with improved transparency in coordinating power transactions
(Denki Shimbun, April 2)
•  The Electric Power Reserve Exchange (EPRX) acquired legal entity status, starting operation with its
revised structure on April 1.
•  The board of directors consists of general managers from nine transmission and distribution firms

(excluding Okinawa). The nine set up EPRX in March 2021 as the operating entity of the Balancing
Market.
•  Regarding the first two auction results disclosed in late March, EPRX’s Secretary General Fukumoto
Naoyuki called the failure to receive bids a big challenge in the supply-demand adjustment (i.e.
balancing) market. He pledged to increase the number of trading members and revitalize the
market.
•  CONTEXT: Setting up a new legal entity is expected to stabilize operations and ensure

transparency and neutrality.

•  Mercuria Energy Group is preparing to begin trading in Japan’s spot market amid the sector’s
rising volatility.
•  Ahead of the move, Mercuria reportedly hired Kato Masayuki, formerly one of Itochu’s top

electricity traders.
•  CONTEXT: The move follows other European energy companies, including BP, which joined the
market last fall, as well as Danske Commodities and Engie earlier this year. Goldman Sachs-backed
InCommodities is another firm in the process of getting a license for physical trading.
• TAKEAWAY: Following the govt’s recent reform of the market, spot power trading has seen a significant
volume increase in the physical electricity market compared to derivatives, drawing interest from overseas

firms interested particularly in decarbonization projects.




METI halts grants for nine solar power firms due to forest land troubles
(Nikkei, April 2)
•  METI suspended grants to nine solar power generation firms engaged in unauthorized
development on forest land. This is the first time the measures were applied since being
introduced this month.
•  The goal is to encourage operators to make effort to gain the understanding of local communities

in areas selected for renewables projects.
•  Under the revised Renewable Energy Special Measures Law that came into force April 1, METI can
suspend the government's FIT and other subsidies for wrongdoing.
•  All nine firms were found to have violated the Forest Act and their FIT grants were suspended. The
names of the firms have not been disclosed but the cases include those where solar panels were
installed without permission.
•  CONTEXT: In relation to the installation of solar panels, there have been a number of cases of

landslides and other disasters caused by operators who do not comply with the law and cut down
more forest than necessary. The govt’s response to developers who have caused problems with
local residents has been limited to issuing them with administrative guidance.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

NEWS:     OIL,  GAS   &  MINING





JBIC, SMB to provide $560 mln to Trafigura to help Japanese utility buy LNG
(Government statement, March 29)
•  The Japan Bank for International Cooperation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp will loan $560

mln to the Singapore arm of Trafigura.
•  JBIC will provide $390 mln, and SMBC $170 mln.
•  The loan is for LNG supply stability, to allow a Japanese utility to import the gas.
•  The statement doesn’t name the Japanese utility buying gas through Trafigura.
• TAKEAWAY: The JBIC decision is unusual as Trafigura is a trading house rather than an upstream developer,
but direct financing of production projects is a govt priority. Trafigura’s impact is not limited to the volume of

its LNG transactions; it also has influence on prices. Unlike Japanese trading houses, Trafigura bids in spot
trades and influences international price trends, which are often based on spot market moves.




Mitsui to produce its first lithium in Q4 when mine launches in Brazil
(Japan NRG, April 4)
•  In Q4, Mitsui & Co will begin its first lithium production, when the Minais Gerais mine launches in
Brazil.
•  The mine’s total output will be 300,000 tons / year of spodumene concentrate, a lithium raw

material; Mitsui will take 15,000 tons / year. The offtake volume will increase to 60,000 tons / year
as output expands.
•  Mitsui & Co has a 12% stake in Atlas Lithium, a U.S. mining company that operates Minais Gerais
and other battery metal projects in Brazil.
•  CONTEXT: Atlas is Mitsui’s first lithium investment. It also plans to produce nickel, graphite and
rare earths in Brazil. Mitsui did not elaborate on the chemical composition of its spodumene.
• TAKEAWAY: The mining operation at Minais Gerais has a low carbon footprint as it is fully powered by

renewables. But neither Mitsui nor Atlas own any facilities to process lithium carbonate or hydroxide for
delivery to battery makers. Control of emissions throughout the lithium value chain is important, which may
vary depending on the method to extract the lithium out of the spodumene.

Japan Ramps Up ‘Blue Carbon’, Betting on Sea Vegetation to Reduce CO2

Kelp and other types of seaweed are not merely staples in the Japanese diet. There
are growing expectations that they can play a role in mitigating climate change, with
the government promoting the usage of so-called ‘blue carbon’ that’s stored in
coastal and marine ecosystems.

Blue carbon is a sister of sorts to ‘green carbon,’ which refers to carbon stored in
terrestrial ecosystems (i.e., forests, peatlands, and grasslands). Blue carbon began to
gain attention following a 2009 report by the United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP) that defined it as a new option for carbon sink measures to remove CO2 from
the atmosphere.

The ocean is among the world’s largest carbon sinks, along with soil and forests.
Coastal habitats like seagrass lands, mangroves, and salt marshes cover less than 2%
of total ocean area, but they account for about half of all sequestered CO2 in ocean
sediments, according to the Blue Carbon Initiative (BCI), which brings together
governments, research institutions and NGOs.

Coastal blue carbon ecosystems, however, are also among the most endangered,
according to BCI, which estimates that 340,000 to 980,000 hectares are destroyed
every year. Up to 67%, and at least 35% and 29% of the global coverage of
mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, respectively, may have been lost
so far. Furthermore, when degraded or lost, these ecosystems can release significant
amounts of CO2 that’s been stored for centuries.


A new inter-ministerial initiative in Japan is starting to tackle the issue by addressing a
blue carbon area that’s received little attention to date.

Background
Seaweed species, however, have been largely excluded from the blue carbon
umbrella, according to Conservation International, a U.S. environmental organization
and one of the organizers of the Blue Carbon Initiative. In fact, the 2009 UNEP report
made no mention of seaweeds.

A 2023 study by Conservation International and the University of Western Australia
estimated that the protection, restoration and improved management of kelp and
seaweed forests globally could provide mitigation benefits in the range of 36 million
tons of CO2, equivalent to the CO2 capturing capacity of as much as 1.6 billion trees.

Quantifying just how much CO2 seaweed forests can absorb is important in reducing
total emissions toward net-zero targets. Every year, countries need to report to the
UN their inventories of man-made emissions by sources, as well as removals by natural
GHG sinks.

In 2013, a supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories was published, expanding the scope of wetlands covered to include

coastal areas. That clarified how to organize inventories on seagrass beds, mangroves,
and tidal marshes. However, seaweed species were not included in the supplement.

In November 2023, Japan, which has been working on a system to calculate how
much seaweed beds can sequester and absorb carbon, published its own guidelines
to measure carbon removals by seaweed beds. The MoE says that it’s ready to report
on carbon removal by both seagrass and seaweed - about 360,000 tons annually - and
the information will be included in an upcoming submission to the UN, due by April
15.

Figure 1 Japan’s GHG emissions and removals




















Source: MoE

Potential in Japan
Japan’s FY2021 carbon removals totaled 47.6 million tons and most is attributed to
forests – trees capturing CO2. For the reporting of FY2021 results in April 2023, for
the first time Japan also included contributions by mangroves, though that was very
small, at 2,300 tons of CO2.

Only four other countries - Australia, the U.S., the UK, and Malta – have included blue
carbon in their inventories. Australia is the only country that includes seagrass, in this
case reporting their loss, which contributes to more CO2 emissions. Because no
country has reported on seaweed, the MoE says the upcoming inventory will make
Japan the first country to officially list the aquatic vegetation’s carbon removal
abilities.

Any contribution from a new carbon sink would help Japan reduce its reported
emissions just as its ability to have carbon absorbed by forests rapidly declines as
human-bred trees grow older and absorb less CO2, says the MLIT.


One study shows that the share of blue carbon in total carbon removals will double
from 6% in 2019 to 12% in 2030. Japan’s annual blue carbon removal totals 1.32
million t-CO2 on average, with seaweed accounting for more than half.

et al, (2019)

Efforts public and private
Efforts in this space by Japan’s ministries include the development of carbon-free
ports by the MLIT where blue carbon can be utilized to offset/reduce emissions and
guidelines set by the Fishery Agency to protect seaweed beds.

To make sure there is greater inter-government collaboration on blue carbon, in
January 2023, an inter-ministerial taskforce was set up for this area, bringing to the
same table representatives from the MoE, MAFF (including the Fishery Agency), and
MLIT.

Activity isn’t limited to national government big-picture policy discussions.
Companies, local governments, and fishery co-ops are also part of the push for blue
carbon. A list by the MoE includes 45 projects conducted by entities such as Hokkaido
Electric, Nippon Steel, and several local governments promoting blue carbon.

Some of the noteworthy blue carbon projects in Japan are as follows:

1) Nippon Steel has been conducting research and pilot projects since 2004 to study
what causes the degradation of seaweed beds; it is working with fishery unions in
Hokkaido, Miyagi, and Mie prefectures. The steel company aims to improve the ocean
ecosystem by installing rocks and blocks for seaweeds to grow on, and by restoring
seaweed beds with fertilizer it developed from steel slag, a byproduct of metallurgy.

2) Urchinomics is working to improve seaweed beds in Yamaguchi and Oita
prefectures by removing sea urchins that prey on seaweeds. The sea urchins are then
grown and sold.

3) J-Power has developed an alternative material for concrete blocks, called J Blue
concrete, made mainly from coal ash and copper slag. They have been installed as
wave-dissipating blocks serving as seaweed beds.

4) ENEOS announced in December that it has begun a study on the large-scale
production of blue carbon with research institutes such as the National Institute of
Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the University of Tokyo.
ENEOS said it aims to produce more than 1 million tons of blue carbon, without
specifying a timeline.

The payoff
Some of these projects can yield credits called J Blue Credits. The Japan Blue
Economy Association is in charge of certifying and issuing the credits. In FY2023, 29
projects were approved to issue credits worth 2,170 t/CO2. Projects by Nippon Steel
and J-Power are among those that have received J Blue Credits.

Other countries are also counting on blue carbon. The International Partnership for
Blue Carbon (IPBC) was launched in 2015 at the UN climate talks (COP21) in Paris. It
was set up for the protection, management and restoration of global coastal blue
carbon ecosystems that can contribute to climate change mitigation, adaptation,
biodiversity, ocean economies and livelihoods of coastal communities.

Japan’s MoE joined the partnership in August 2023. Australia serves as the
coordinator, and NGOs, government agencies, and research institutes are among the
55 members.

While promoting blue carbon has just begun, protecting ocean ecosystems has many
benefits, with the removal of CO2 that can be commoditized into transferable credits
as one of them.

Further out, seaweed farming has the potential to provide a substitute or supplement
for food, animal feed and biofuels; which in turn can lessen agriculture’s overall GHG
emissions. The exploration of the sea’s carbon economy is just getting started.

ANALYSIS

Energy Jobs in Japan: Plug & Play, or Invest in Potential?
Client: “We want young, ambitious, bilingual talent with a mix of technical skills as
well as solid commercial acumen, who has worked for years with our direct
competitor; will match with our culture and is motivated to work for us.”


Agent: “Yep, I’m sure you do. The only issue is that so do all of your competitors.”

I’m slightly exaggerating, but there has been a shift in certain areas of the energy
talent ecosystem. Today, there’s a recently developed pool of talent that has led to an
attitude shift among hiring companies to consider poaching from competitors first,
rather than hire the high potential talent who doesn’t yet have the optimal resume.
Offshore wind, energy storage, corporate PPAs, carbon accounting, and various front
and mid office roles in power markets are those in which this trend is now prevalent.

Poaching is certainly possible, and successful cases are increasing. Competition
though is fierce, and demand outweighs supply, which can inflate prices and give
suboptimal offers to acceptance results. Let’s look at whether poaching is the ideal
approach – How to do it well, and investigate the alternative approach of hiring for
talent rather than direct experience.

The price of talent in Japan has increased
As has been well publicized in recent months, the age of deflation in Japan is finally at
its end. Real estate prices have been steadily increasing for the better part of a
decade now, peaking with a 30% increase across the Tokyo metropolitan area in
2023. Salaries have lagged behind, but are now moving, with a 3.8% average increase
across all TYSE listed firms in 2023, and similar predictions for 2024. Tax incentives are
in place for large firms offering 7% or greater wage hikes, and 4% or greater for SMEs,
both of which are occurring at rates not seen since the bubble era in 1980s to early
1990s.

These statistics are aligned with Titan’s internal data, where we track talent that we’ve
supported to change companies at 1, 2 and 3-year intervals and have seen an average
wage increase of 3% over the past 3 years (not including promotions).

The real cost is compounded by the strong performance and record profits from a
number of trading houses, energy majors and oil & gas firms, resulting in actual bonus
payouts exceeding the theoretical amount, with many cases in the range of 1.5 ~ 2x of
target.

Based upon a healthy annual wage increase, coupled with a 1.5x payout of a typical
variable bonus of 25% of base salary, the cost of the same talent increased >20% over
the past 3 years.


Paying the poaching premium
Talent working for a direct competitor has the strongest appeal for hiring firms. Their
knowledge of the market or technology, connections with clients / vendors and up to
21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

date regulatory knowledge are all desirable. Their ability to plug into the role with
minimal time loss and investment in training and development is also appealing, and
can lower both opportunity and T&D costs. Most hiring companies recognise this, and
build in a premium rate to attract such talent. Historically, this has hovered around
10%, with 5% variability either side.

Poaching passive talent from competitors comes with the added challenge for the
hiring company to offer professionals something they do not already have in their
current firm. In some cases, it can be the chance to work on a new technology, or a
project that has been recently won. Without this, the candidate is more than likely to
demand a step up: a shift to management, a promotion to Director level, etc.

With an increasingly diverse set of players in today’s energy market, illustrated by
continued new market entry of foreign players, more aggressive investment by
Japanese industry and a slowly growing start-up innovation ecosystem, competition
for talent has increased. This compounds the challenge of meeting the candidate’s
demands with the need to win a bidding war to secure the services.

As an illustration of this trend, the most recent four changes that Titan has facilitated
to direct competitors, with competition for the talent in question, have resulted in
total package increases of 18%, 33%, 50% and 21%.

Clear and hidden benefits of investing in potential
In 2011, domestic renewable energy was virtually non-existent. The earthquake and
then tsunami striking Fukushima Dai-ichi and the subsequent shutdown of all nuclear
plants changed this. With around 24% of generating capacity knocked out overnight,
Japan set about promoting renewable energy growth with one of the most lucrative
Feed-in-Tariff systems globally.


Both domestic and international investors and developers raced to get a piece of the
market, even though there was close to zero experienced talent to hire. Those early
years of the solar boom saw developers hiring from module makers, real estate
brokerages, ski resort developers, general contractors and even ramen and chocolate
entrepreneurs (true story…). Everyone learned the business from scratch, with varying
levels of success, of course. However, the moral of the story remains. If you have an
attractive business, people will invest their time to jump in, learn and can become
industry leaders.

As the primary motivation of this talent pool is to shift into your company and / or
industry sector rather than primarily financial, they typically have a mindset to invest in
themselves and demand a lower increase, or in some cases can be hired for the same
or less as their previous incomes. Depending on the demand for their transferable
skills in both your competing industry and the wider market, you may also avoid the
bidding war inflation effect as well.

On one hand, this talent will take a bigger front-end investment from the employer to
train and develop, however you have the benefit to mold them to fit your business
and avoid any undesirable habits. Breaking negative habits and ingrained methods of
working can often take longer than the training and formation of new skills.

Employee referrals reduce cost of hire and lower risk
What percentage of your hires annually come via employee referrals? We have seen
attractive energy tech start-ups adding upward of 50% of their workforce from internal
referrals, to global giants struggling to get into double figures.

When you consider the cost of an internal talent acquisition team, plus all overheads,
social insurances etc. or paying Japan level agency fees (typically 35 ~ 40% for expert
service), the savings from promoting an employee referral program are significant.

Other benefits include:
•  Hire a known quantity; your employees won’t bring in the ‘problem child’
from their prior organizations.
•  Cultural integration; the new hire already has a buddy in your firm.
•  Less competition; with a 15~18% market penetration across LinkedIn and
major Japanese job boards combined, your employee referral has a >80%
chance to not be interviewing all over town.
•  Financial gain is not the key motivator to move, reducing the premium.


Internal equity dilemma, bring your crew along
As an agency, we have cases at offer negotiation time where the current and
expected package cost of the candidate that our client wants to hire becomes an
internal equity issue. How can the company justify paying the new, unproven hire
more than the loyal employee who has been performing well for a number of years?

Fair question. Let’s revisit one of the first points in this column - Japan is not in
deflation anymore, and salaries are increasing. Did you increase across your team in
the last few years? Your competition most likely did. This not only will cause
headaches for both the business and HR departments at the offer stage around
internal equity, it also leaves you wide open for attack from competitors who realize
you are a great place to find a bargain….

Review your team and wider market trends regularly, benchmark against competitors
and ensure that you are in a position to be competitive to hire and protect yourself
from guys like us (sorry!).

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

Bangladesh / Coal power
Coal will overtake natural gas as the country’s primary electricity source. Local power
firms more than doubled coal-fired electricity generation in 2023 over 2022 levels to a
record 17 TWh. In the same period, natural gas-fired electricity output only increased
4.7% to 47.44 TWh.

China / EV charging
Oil company Sinopec is installing thousands of battery recharging sites across China.
EV sales in the world's largest auto market are expected to account for 40% of the 23
million sold this year. China's gasoline demand is expected to peak in 2025 and then
halve by 2045.

China / Natural gas
GCL Holdings is rebuilding a natural gas business after selling hundreds of solar
installations to set up gas import capacity. It will join the tier-two LNG players in China
such as city-gas companies ENN and Beijing Gas Group that seek to ramp up imports.

China / Solar power
Consolidation in China's crowded solar power sector is pushing smaller players out of
the market. Excess production capacity could keep global prices low for years. China
accounts for 80% of solar module production capacity.

Global oil refining
More than 20% of global oil refining capacity might shut, claims Wood Mackenzie.
Europe and China have the greatest number of high-risk sites – 11 in Europe, and 7 in
China. This is based on estimates of net cash margins, cost of carbon emissions,
strategic value, etc.

India / Hydropower
Main reservoirs hit their lowest March levels in five years, impacting hydropower
availability this summer. Affected are major economic centers such as Bengaluru. The
150 reservoirs that supply water for hydro-electricity were filled to just 40% of
capacity.

India / Renewable energy
Adani Green Energy exceeded 10 GW of operational renewable energy portfolio,
India’s first company to do so.The capacity breaks down as 7.39 GW solar, 1.4 GW
wind, and 2.14 GW wind-solar hybrid capacity.

Indonesia / Mining
The world’s top nickel producer will expand output despite a glut that’s forcing rivals
to shut mines. Indonesia’s production capacity for battery-grade nickel is expected to
quadruple to 1 million tons by 2030. This will keep prices low and protect long-term
demand for the metal crucial to EV batteries

LNG / Spot prices
Asian spot LNG prices were unchanged this week, as demand from buyers continued
shoring up prices. The average LNG price for May delivery into northeast Asia held at
$9.50/mmBtu, the same as the previous week, which was its highest level since
February 9.

Russia / LNG
The Chinese ship Hunter Star delivered the final liquefaction module for Novatek’s
Arctic LNG 2 facility. Novatek, the Arctic LNG 2 project itself, and the Belokamenka
construction yard near Murmansk have all been sanctioned by the U.S. The transfer of
technology used for liquefaction of natural gas has also been banned by the EU.
