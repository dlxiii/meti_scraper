METI asks Kyushu and Chubu power companies to report on unauthorized data access
(Government statement, Feb. 14)
•  METI asked Kyushu Electric, Kyushu Electric Transmission and Distribution, Chubu Electric Power
Miraiz and Chubu Electric Power Grid to file reports on unauthorized access to customer data of
renewable operators.
•  The data possibly included names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.
•  METI said up to 1.57 million accounts may have been affected but has not clarified the number of

individuals impacted.
•  CONTEXT: The scope of data breaches in the industry has widened rapidly in recent weeks. At
least five or six major utilities are now suspected of allowing staff from the generation side of the
group business to access data of related transmissions companies and even METI databases. This
damages the credibility of the industry liberalization that was orchestrated by METI.
• TAKEAWAY: METI’s announcement on the possible personal data breach brings the case to another level. In

the context of the Electricity Business Act, the renewables operators are victims, but under the Personal
Information Protection Act, the renewables operators could be held liable for failing to set firewalls to protect
customer data. The Personal Information Protection Act requires companies to file incident reports to the
Personal Information Protection Commission (PPC) if data of over 1,000 persons has been exposed.

• METI did not say credit card and bank account data were exposed, meaning the risk of financial damages is
nearly zero. However, the situation puts renewable operators under strain as the privacy act requires them to
inform customers that their data was breached.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Editorial: Power companies flout reforms
(Shukan Economist, Feb. 21)
o  CONTEXT: This is an opinion article written by the editorial team.
o  Fallout continues from revelations that six electricity companies improperly accessed

subscriber information.
o  The separation of generation and transmission functions was the centerpiece of a state
deregulation plan introduced in 1999.
o  However, despite concerns about the need to stop confidential information being
exchanged between generators and TSOs (transmission system operators), pushback
from the industry resulted in an arrangement that merely ensured “legal separation”.

o  While the industry made repeated assurances that it would follow the rules, the latest
scandal shows that the big power companies have ignored the spirit of industry reforms.


LDP to promote NPP replacement with new sites to build new NPPs
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 17)
•  The Federation of LDP Diet Members for Promoting Replacement of Nuclear Reactors met on Feb

16 in the House of Representatives.
•  Chairwoman Ms. Tomomi Inada said: “While it’s appreciated that replacement of old NPPs was
included in the GX program, it’s on the premise that new NPPs are built on the site of
decommissioned reactors. However,… to usher in much safer NPPs, the building of “replacement”
NPPs on new sites must also be allowed.”
•  About 40 LDP members (including proxy) attended the meeting.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has not started commercial operations at an entirely new nuclear power generation site for

almost 30 years. All reactors built in-between were additional units at existing station. Thus, establishing a new
site for a nuclear power plant is seen as a major hurdle. These lawmakers hope to extend the “replacement”
idea to include reactors at new sites. For example, if a utility says it doesn’t have space to build a new next-gen
reactor at the NPP site where it is decommissioning a unit, it would be able to claim the right to locate the new
unit at a different location.



PM Kishida calls for more discussions on NPP reaction reactor extensions
(Reuters, Feb. 17)
•  METI Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said PM Kishida has requested more in-depth discussions on

extending the operational years of NPPs, and to be well prepared for Diet deliberations, before it
faces approval in the Cabinet meeting.
•  Mr. Nishimura will especially work on safety regulations. He said: “We hope to win Cabinet
approval as soon as possible, but a certain amount of time will be needed to proceed in a careful
manner.”
• TAKEAWAY: PM Kishida’s request is a countermeasure to some within the nuclear industry regulator, the NRA,
that oppose the government’s decision to dismiss the years a reactor spent idle post-Fukushima from their

operating license term. Normally, NRA commissioners vote unanimously but when it came to this matter there
was disagreement at the Feb 13 vote. To avoid the opposition lawmakers using NRA’s stance to criticize the
government, Kishida is turning to METI for additional assurances on safety aspects.

METI to push demand-response capabilities for home appliances
(Japan NRG, Feb. 15)
•  METI plans to push the introduction of electricity demand-response (DR) capabilities on air
conditioners, water heaters, televisions and other home appliances to improve energy efficiency

and encourage consumer shift to non-fossil power.
•  The ministry is studying the system in Australia, which has mandated selected home appliances to
be equipped with smart DR capabilities.
•  The Air Conditioner and Water Heater Standards Working Group of Energy Conservation Sub-
Panel will write the specific standards and requirements.
• TAKEAWAY: Prof. Matsumura Toshihiro of Tokyo University who serves the Energy Conservation Sub-Panel

told METI that sophisticated power market mechanisms are essential to make DR work. Consuming power
when there’s abundant solar power helps cut back on fossil fuel use, but the present system doesn’t allow
consumers to be rewarded financially.



METI seeks public input on TEPCO Energy Partner, Hokkaido Electric’s rate hike plans
(Government statement, Feb. 14)
•  TEPCO Energy Partner plans a hike averaging 29.31%, and Hokkaido Electric 34.87%, both
effective June 1. Public submission of opinion closes on April 20.




Government relaxes fire safety rules on lithium-ion batteries
(Government statement, Feb. 15)
●  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will relax fire safety rules on lithium-ion
batteries for power storage and EVs, to be consistent with international rules and to increase
investments.

●  In-house storage systems must not be over 6 meters high, and floor space is limited to 1,000
square meters. Systems with built-in water sprinklers can exceed this limit.
●  Battery systems won’t be required to keep distance from schools and residential areas.
●  Safety measurements of EV batteries will change.
●  Field tests on the newly proposed standards were held in 2022. The new standards will be
effective after revising the relevant ministry ordinances.




LDP Diet members create federation to promote domestic renewable energy equipment
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 16)
•  Nearly 80 LDP diet members established a Federation to Promote Developing Domestic
Technologies of Renewable Energy Equipment. PM Kishida is among the initiators.
•  The federation will prioritize the domestic development and production of PV solar cells and

floating type offshore wind plants. Currently, a large part of the components of renewable energy
infrastructure built in Japan is imported from other countries.
•  The global market for offshore wind power plant equipment is dominated by EU and Chinese
manufacturers. The federation wants to build a supply chain focused on domestic manufacturers.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: This new LDP initiative is in line with the national energy transition roadmap – the GX program.
The roadmap calls for development of domestic supply chains in next-gen solar technologies including
Perovskite PV cells and for floating offshore wind power plants. The LDP’s goal is to support the government’s
target of raising renewable energy’s share in the power mix to 36-38% by 2030. The government believes the
target cannot be met if Japan relies solely on imports of renewable energy equipment.

• For further details on how lawmaker groups can have an impact on national energy policy, see this week’s
Analysis section.



Vice-Minister suspected of perjury over donation from wind developer
(Bunshun, Feb. 8)
•  Sources allege that Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Akimoto Masatoshi got a ¥1.8

million donation from an advisor to renewables solutions provider Renova.
•  Facing questions in the Diet, Akimoto denied getting such a donation.
•  During his time as Parliamentary Secretary for Land, Infrastructure and Transport (2017-2018),
Akimoto was heavily involved in the promotion of offshore wind farms.
•  Optimism about the prospects for the industry saw Renova’s share price increase from less than
¥600 in 2017 to over ¥6,000 in 2021.




Osaka Gas, MHI and IBM to develop platform to trade value of e-methane supply chain
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 16)
•  Osaka Gas, MHI and Japan IBM will develop an experimental platform to trade the environmental
value for the total supply chain of e-methane. The system makes the value tangible by visualizing
the amount of CO2 that’s reduced through the use of the cleaner fuel.
•  Developing such a system is a world first. The three companies started the Proof of Concept in

October 2022, and will start marketing it in late FY2024.
•  CONTEXT: It is expected that e-methane will be transported in Japan through existing natural gas
pipelines. Since this means that the “clean” gas is mixed in with natural gas, a new system is
needed to measure and monitor the environmental impact. The gains (i.e., the reductions in CO2
achieved by applying e-methane) could then be coined as carbon credits.
• TAKEAWAY: E-methane, which is synthesized methane made from hydrogen and recycled CO2, is listed as

one of three carbon recycling technologies in the GX. By synthesizing methane, METI hoped to replace 1% of
natural gas by 2030, and 90% of natural gas by 2050. These plans, however, are now being reviewed and may
be downgraded.

investing $7.6 million in local production and installation systems.

•  The redox flow technology offers some 20 years of battery life and is highly regarded for its use in
applications such as grid-side supply and demand adjustment, microgrid operation in
emergencies, and energy trading in the ancillary services market.
•  CONTEXT: Sumitomo Electric hopes that its North American manufacturing base will be able to
meet the increasing global demand for large-scale storage batteries. The company began
developing redox flow batteries in 1985 and commercialized them in 2001.




TEPCO to lower number of radionuclides monitored in Fukushima treated water
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 15)
•  TEPCO will change the number of radionuclides it monitors in treated water at the Fukushima
nuclear site. At present, the number is 64 (including tritium) and the new number will be 30.
•  TEPCO held discussions with IAEA and the industry regulator NRA and plans to amend its

monitoring accordingly.
•  The utility will continue to monitor the other radionuclides on a voluntary basis.
•  CONTEXT: Water at the Fukushima site is processed through a system known as ALPS to remove
harmful levels of radionuclides. A large volume of water has already passed through the ALPS
system and the utility says it is running out of storage space for all the water. TEPCO plans to start
releasing treated water into the ocean later this year and has promised to ensure the release meets
international safety standards.

TEPCO clips the wings of its power retailing unit as TCS gives up independent trading
(Diamond, Feb. 14)
•  TEPCO Customer Service Service (TCS), a unit of TEPCO Energy Partners that was retailing
electricity outside of the company’s traditional Tokyo area, will be folded more closely into the

parent company.
•  TCS sought to expand TEPCO’s business to sales of extra high voltage and high voltage electricity
for corporate clients in the Kansai area. However, due to a sharp hike in fuel price, the unit’s
revenues are down.
•  TCS will now be tasked with helping to retail the electricity produced by TEPCO Energy Partners
and will no longer be in a position to purchase and sell electricity on its own. TCS quietly withdrew

its JEPX membership in October 2022.
•  CONTEXT: TCS was once a major retailer in the Kansai region.
• TAKEAWAY: TCS became infamous for its role in the sudden surge of power prices in January 2021. The
TEPCO unit has struggled to recover since then and faltered to create a business from pure retail of electricity
(i.e., without also owning generation capacity). In the broader sense, this probably marks the end of TEPCO’s
ambitions to break into the Kansai region in any meaningful way.

KEPCO to use drones for offshore wind turbines inspections
(Nikkei, Feb. 15)
•  Kansai Electric (KEPCO) will start inspections of offshore wind power generation facilities using
drones in 2024. 5G antennas are installed at offshore wind farms and optical cables are laid

between them and power generation facilities. Images taken by drones are sent to a monitoring
center onshore for analysis.
•  The conventional method for inspecting wind power generation equipment is for workers to climb
up to the wind turbines using ropes and visually check for damage. This requires two days to check
one turbine. With a drone, eight turbines can be inspected in the same time.

Japan and China Seek to Forge Hydrogen Ties that Defy Geopolitics
Hydrogen-fueled power generation is an integral part of both Japan’s and China’s
strategy for the clean energy transition through 2050. Japan is betting on hydrogen as
a reliable and cost-effective replacement of fossil energy that’s less exposed to
geopolitical risks. China needs decarbonization solutions that can rapidly be built and
scaled up to meet the voracious energy needs of a country with 1.4 billion people.

Despite rising geopolitical tensions, China and Japan are also trying to manage and
coordinate their efforts for the development of hydrogen energy. The latest efforts in
this regard took place at the 16th Japan-China Energy Conservation and Environment
Forum, held earlier this month.

The annual forum had its hiccups. It was delayed by two months and finally organized
on a Japan national holiday. Keynote speeches by senior government and business
leaders contained remarks expressing discontent on certain policy issues, such as
semiconductors. In contrast, the mood in the hydrogen session was positive.

The hydrogen sector in the two countries seems keen to collaborate and resolve
technical and cost challenges. As Japan NRG joined the forum, we couldn’t help but
feel that these resolutions could in turn beget fresh policy conflicts.


Similar goals, different paths
Japan’s greenhouse gas emissions were 1.08 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in 2021.
Emissions from power plants and oil refineries accounted for 40%. The country’s 2030
goal is to cut the total emissions down to 0.76 billion tons by 2030, and achieve
carbon neutrality by 2050.

China’s greenhouse gas emissions were 12.5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in 2021,
or 32.9% of the world total. By 2030 Beijing plans to cut emissions per unit of GDP by
more than 65% from 2005 levels, and reach carbon neutrality by 2060.

Both China and Japan are supporting breakthrough hydrogen energy solutions that
will power their currently dirty steel, chemical and other manufacturing industries.
Modernizing energy supply to these power-intensive sectors is both crucial and
challenging.

During the Feb 11 forum, Tokyo and Beijing signed an agreement to deepen
cooperation on carbon neutrality initiatives, notably hydrogen, between Japan’s
NEDO and AIST, and China’s National Development Reform Commission. These
agreements came just three months after Prime Minister Kishida and China’s
President Xi Jinping agreed to collaborate on carbon neutrality efforts, which was
reconfirmed when the foreign ministers of the two countries met on Feb 2.

The two Asia Pacific neighbors share similar goals but stride different paths. Japan
was the original pioneer in hydrogen power. In 2017, Tokyo announced the world’s
first national hydrogen strategy, and by 2021 its Basic Energy Plan officially stated that
hydrogen will account for up to 1% of Japan’s energy mix by 2030.

While China at first lagged behind, it’s now racing forward at full speed. With its vast
existing renewable capacity, as well as ample land, China can more readily build large
hydrogen production facilities. In March 2022, China published the Medium and
Long-Term Hydrogen Energy Industry Development Plan, which calls for hydrogen
demand to reach 35 million tons by 2030.

Later this year, Sinopec Group, the world's largest oil refining, gas and petrochemical
conglomerate, will launch a 20,000 tons/ year solar-powered hydrogen electrolysis
plant, and the company is building a wind-powered 30,000 tons/ year hydrogen plant.
Sinopec also plans offshore floating hydrogen production facilities; ocean water and
wind power will help generate hydrogen.

Given its vast size, China is also keen to develop on-site hydrogen consumption. Li
Shuai, an NDRC official, said the number of hydrogen projects has climbed to 190 and
the use of fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) is spreading fast at mines and ports.

It’s a very different situation in Japan. Since the cost of domestically-produced
renewables is very high, Japan will have to import hydrogen. Therefore, Tokyo plans
to focus on the storage, shipping and usage of hydrogen. Toward that goal, a pilot
project for transporting liquefied hydrogen from Australia was undertaken last year.

Building on that experience, later this year there’ll be a pilot for shipping hydrogen
converted into methylcyclohexane (MCH) from Australia. Panasonic, Denso and other
companies have developed systems that integrate hydrogen with renewable power
systems, to produce energy for their own corporate consumption.

Japan is also speeding up efforts to codify hydrogen safety rules and standards. The
Hydrogen Center, a new unit of The High-Pressure Gas Safety Institute of Japan
(KHK), was established last month. China endorsed these safety standards because
any accident at hydrogen supply outlets could slow its spread elsewhere.

Hino Yukari, ANRE’s new energy systems director, recounted Japan’s plans for clusters
of hydrogen consumers in the vicinity of major ports. Hydrogen bases will be set up at
three large and five middle-sized ports, which will receive hydrogen imports, and then
supply the molecules to nearby manufacturing plants.

Ms Hino believes that the two neighbors can complement each other in the
development of hydrogen power. China has the largest fuel-cell vehicle market and
the largest hydrogen production capacity. Meanwhile, Japan has the largest number
of patents and diverse applications, ranging from hydrogen usage not limited to big
power plants and mobility, but also at smaller plants for various industries.

What can Japan gain from China? Tokyo has expectations regarding China’s ability to
combat costs. China deals with large supply and demand on a day-to-day basis, and
has always excelled in cost reductions. Its success in building up a large EV market in
several years, as well as beating battery raw material and cost challenges, are raising
hopes that they may achieve revolutionary cost cuts with hydrogen.

Price gaps between hydrogen and fossil fuels need to narrow, which is a challenge
that all governments recognize. Closer Japan-China hydrogen ties have the potential
to spur cost reduction breakthroughs. If this can be achieved, then it will cement their

Political tensions remain an obstacle
Energy security is paramount for energy-starved Japan. But any possible dependency
on China for hydrogen might defeat this goal. Japan recently enacted the Economic
Security Act to rebuild supply chains of security-sensitive products such as LNG,
storage batteries, rare earths among others.

While the two governments are boosting investments in the hydrogen sector, the
vexing reality is that energy cannot stay isolated from geopolitical issues. And as
events of the past year have made clear, geopolitics and energy go hand-in-hand.

During the forum, a senior Chinese NDRC official, He Lifeng, criticized Japan’s
semiconductor trade policy for lack of transparency. Japan’s METI minister responded
by saying that China needs to set strong rules on intellectual property protection and
market competition. “Japan’s NEDO and China’s NDRC signed an agreement to
promote hydrogen…but China needs to further improve IP and competition
frameworks,” said METI minister Nishimura.

The fragile political situation between the countries is unfortunately straining
hydrogen collaboration. Despite China’s geographical proximity to Japan and its
potential as a major hydrogen supply base, Japan’s mainstream hydrogen supply
chains are currently focused on Australia and the Middle East. This is in line with the
Biden administration’s policy of ‘friendshoring’ – establishing supply chains with like-
minded allies, and avoiding such ties with countries deemed ‘unfriendly’.

Japan has hydrogen alliances with the U.S., the EU, Australia, India and other
countries, including development of technologies and making sure that regulatory
rules in the different countries harmonize with the others.

One Japanese company official who signed carbon neutrality projects with several
Chinese partners said political uncertainties are putting the brakes on important
projects, and inhibit the growth of business with China.

While 17 bilateral projects were signed at the forum, private sector participation was
weak; just seven were with Japanese companies, such as MUFG Bank, Hitachi,
Mitsubishi Electric, Ooparts, and Ituba Kyoso.

As geopolitical instability grows in the world, it remains to be seen whether the two
countries will move closer or drift apart on energy issues. In that context, the recent
NEDO/AIST-NDRC collaboration framework will be an interesting litmus test that will
gauge the chances of successful Japanese-Chinese cooperation on energy.

Forging consensus:
The influence of Parliamentary Groups on Energy Policies

In Japan, energy-related parliamentary groups often consist solely of ruling LDP
members, and although they don’t directly and immediately impact the government’s
plans, their influence and advocacy often have major implications for the long-term
direction of policy.

Similar to caucuses in the U.S. Congress, specialized groups in the Diet serve as
channels to connect with each industry or seek to realize new policies. The members
don't receive any status or benefit by joining one. But the Atomic Energy Basic Law
enacted in 1955, (which paved the way for the use of nuclear power in Japan), is a
prime example of how parliamentary groups can bring about new legislation.

Such groups in the Diet participate in the preparatory stage each time the
government must update its Basic Energy Plan, which is reviewed every three years.
Major groups in the Diet jockeyed to make the wording of that document more
favorable to the interests of their constituents, though it has to accord with the Prime
Minister’s overall energy policy direction.

For instance, during the Suga administration, parliamentary groups active in
renewable energy became more vocal than previously. Meanwhile, under Prime
Minister Kishida those groups which focus on nuclear power are more confident in
making bolder demands. This is in large part due to the urgency of the energy crisis
since the drastic spike in energy prices following the start of full-fledged war in
Ukraine in February 2022.

More recently, heavyweight politicians have helped launch parliamentary groups that
promote new energy technologies such as biofuels and batteries. Japan NRG takes a
closer look at the main groups in the Diet that are major players behind the scenes in
the formulation of state energy policy.


Nuclear energy
The Parliamentary Group for Power Stability, which is led by Speaker of the House of
Representatives Hosoda Hiroyuki, has made a series of proposals to the government
for the expansion of nuclear power, and, to a lesser degree, that of renewable energy
sources. As a moderate supporter of nuclear power, the group has nevertheless
stressed its importance, and called for the acceleration of NPP restarts in the
aftermath of the Fukushima disaster.

In the past several years, instead of the conventional thinking of “reducing as much as
possible”, the group further endorsed the Basic Energy Plan’s pledge to “utilize
Hosoda Hiroyuki nuclear energy to the maximum degree”. This group helped to convince the
Photo: The Asahi Shimbun government to “start a discussion” to build new NPPs or replace existing plants. Their
program became more pertinent when energy prices soared following the start of the
Ukraine war.

As a more progressive supporter of nuclear energy, the Non-Partisan Parliamentary
Group for Underground Nuclear Power Plants surfaced right after the Fukushima crisis
to showcase alternative technology in the nuclear sector. The group’s current advisor
is Takaichi Sanae, who rivaled PM Kishida in the presidential election for the LDP in
2021.

Next, there’s the Parliamentary Group for Replacement, which also advocates for
nuclear power. The group was founded in 2021 ahead of the Sixth Energy Strategic
Plan by initiative of the late ex-PM Abe, former METI Minister Amari, and Hosoda,
with Inada Tomomi as a top leader.

summer, their voice was heard by PM Kishida when he officially welcomed the idea to
develop and build next-generation innovative reactors that incorporate new safety
measures.
Currently, this group is pressing the government for a Cabinet decision on
replacement, overriding the current Basic Energy Plan. They believe that replacement
is best achieved as a combination of decommissioning and new construction by each
utility.

One example of the Replacement Group’s work is the proposed construction of a
next-generation reactor by Chugoku Electric in Yamaguchi Prefecture. Planning for
this Kaminoseki NPP project began decades ago but was put on hold after the
Fukushima accident. The utility is keen to restart the project, but since it would be an
entirely new site for an NPP, it has found a clever workaround. Chugoku Electric is due
to decommission Unit 1 at its Shimane NPP site, 250 kilometers further north. It wants
the construction at Kaminoseki to count as a “replacement” for losing a reactor at the
Shimane NPP location.

Renewable energy
Shibayama Masahiko leads the Parliamentary Group for Renewable Energy. Prior to
the latest revision (the Sixth) of the Basic Energy Plan, he insisted that renewable
energy should be mentioned as a “top priority”, while raising to 45% or above the
ratio of renewable energy to total energy output.

Recently, the group has been focusing on offshore wind power, requesting that the
project planning process be accelerated and that the selection process be more
transparent.

The Parliamentary Group for Hydrogen Society Promotion is headed by former METI
Minister Obuchi Yuko. The group sees hydrogen as essential to a zero-carbon future.
The hydrogen association also calls on the government to expand budgetary
measures in order to promote the use of FCVs, FC buses, and FC forklifts and
hydrogenize traditional transport facilities such as airplanes, ships, and trains.

Obuchi recently urged METI to work on the enactment of a hydrogen society
promotion law. “Japan was the most advanced country in the world (in hydrogen), but
competitors are catching up”, she says.

Storage batteries
Other than these more established energy groups, there are two new groups that
have received wide attention. Launched by Abe and Amari in 2021, the Parliamentary
Group for Storage Battery not surprisingly calls for promoting battery innovations. The
group regards storage batteries as an “extremely important strategic field that will
determine the fate of the country” and is studying measures to improve international
competitiveness.

Specifically, the group requests the government to take action such as promoting
virtual power plants (VPP) that utilize EVs and stationary storage batteries, as well as
establishing large-scale production. It also proposes the creation of a ¥3 trillion fund
for securing important mineral resources that are crucial in battery production.

In October 2022, the launch of the Parliamentary Group for Biofuel Promotion came
under the media spotlight. This group, initiated by Amari, included both PM Kishida
and his predecessor Suga, the former’s political rival, as members.
They discuss the use of domestically produced biofuels and synthetic fuels in the
aviation and automobile sectors. The group also calls on the government to support
building production facilities to promote the use of SAF, and to exempt SAF-related
raw materials from import tariffs.

All in all, parliamentary groups play a key role in conveying the voice of the respective
industry to the national government. Not surprisingly, they seek opportunities to
shape the direction of policy in their favor, typically when the Basic Energy Plan comes
under review.

Their agendas and goals deserve even closer attention when the government is faced
with a significant energy crisis that might lead to a drastic change in course, such as
Suga Yoshihide the Fukushima disaster or the Ukraine war. Moreover, the entangled web of

and well behind the scenes.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Oil and gas
Woodside Energy will face a nearly $4.4 billion expense this year after reviewing its
methodology to calculate depreciation of oil and gas properties; for example, it took
into account the scale of its portfolio since acquiring BHP Group's petroleum assets.

Belgium/ Energy efficiency
Ineos secured €3.5 billion in financing for a new energy-efficient petrochemical facility
in Belgium. The company, controlled by the UK’s richest man Jim Ratcliffe, plans to
develop its “Project ONE” cracker in Antwerp.

China/ LNG
China National Petroleum Corp will soon ink a deal to buy LNG from QatarEnergy
over nearly 30 years. This will be the second such deal between Qatar and China, the
world's No. 2 LNG buyer.

Coal/ Record profits
Commodity trader Glencore’s profits hit a record $34 billion, in large part driven by
soaring coal demand. Also, hedge funds such as Third Point, Makuria Investment
Management and Odey Asset Management reaped record profits from coal’s
renaissance. The price of thermal coal has more than tripled in less than two years.

EU/ Cars
The European Parliament approved a law that in essence will ban the sale of new
petrol and diesel cars from 2035, aiming to speed up the switch to EVs. By 2035,
carmakers must achieve a 100% cut in CO2 emissions from new cars sold in the EU.

France/ Nuclear power
In 2022, nuclear power giant EDF had a record net loss of €17.9 billion, as the
company faced an unprecedented number of outages at its reactors that led output to
fall to a 34-year low. In the end, EDF had to buy electricity on the market to supply
customers.

Germany/ Hydrogen
Germany and Belgium held their first energy summit, and agreed to develop
hydrogen infrastructure, with the goal of connecting theirs by 2028. The two will also
increase the flow of LNG from Belgium to Germany, and to cooperate more on
energy in the North Sea.

Indonesia/ Palm oil
Indonesia and Malaysia, the world's biggest palm oil producers, will send envoys to
the EU to discuss its new deforestation law that requires companies to show when and
where their palm oil was produced. Also, it must show it wasn’t grown on land
deforested after 2020.

Israel/ Oil
The country’s first-ever stream of oil exports has launched from Energean’s Karish
development in the eastern Mediterranean. Energean, which is listed in London, has
grown rapidly since founded by Greek banker Mathios Rigas in 2007.

Oil and gas/ Record profits
In 2022, the global oil and gas industry's total annual profits soared to about $4
trillion, almost triple the usual average of $1.5 trillion, said the International Energy
Agency (IEA).

U.S./ Batteries
