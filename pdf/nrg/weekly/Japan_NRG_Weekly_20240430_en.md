NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





METI panel publishes 2040 industrial strategy paper, with focus on growth opportunities
(Government statement, April 24)
•  A METI panel on long-term industrial policy published an interim report on strategies through
2040, with a focus on using social issues (health, economic security, green and digital

transformations) as growth opportunities.
•  Since it’s socially and politically more stable than other countries, Japan can play a vital role in
global supply chains. Upstream efforts are important for securing base metals such as copper, as
well as critical raw materials.
•  Regarding the GX, the report said that efforts on the 2026 launch of the emission trade (GX-ETS)
should continue; incentives and regulatory measures can combine to generate a market that might
have linkages with allies.

•  Japan will build supply chains with allies by coordinating transition investment policies and to
advance specific programs for the Asia Zero Emission Community.
•  CONTEXT: Every June, the govt releases the Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management
and Reform, also known as the ‘Big-Boned Policy’. Business lobby groups ask to include a longer
term policy scenario in the upcoming policy. This METI paper is likely to be referenced for writing
the next Big-Boned Policy.
• TAKEAWAY: The paper hints at the potential for Japan’s carbon credit markets to be linked to similar

exchanges or programs in other countries. At this point, this is just a mention in a broader strategy paper that
has far-off targets and little substance. However, it points to the direction that some in govt and business
believe Japan should take – creating an international carbon credits marketplace, which would see CO2
reductions in one place credited / traded in another.




Aomori Pref will start drafting a tax ordinance on renewables

(Japan NRG, April 25)
•  Aomori Pref will draft a new ordinance titled “Towards co-habitation of nature and renewables”; it
includes a new tax on operators, establishing zones prohibiting renewables, and calls for dialogue
with local stakeholders.
•  The Aomori governor appointed seven external experts, mostly academics, to the Study
Committee. Its first meeting will be on May 2, and several more will be scheduled before the draft
is completed.
•  Possible tax targets are onshore wind and solar operators that are perceived to have had an

environmental impact, both new and those in operation.
•  The ordinance is expected to pass by late FY2024, pending local assembly approval.

•  CONTEXT: Aomori has 407 onshore wind turbines with a total combined capacity of 910 MW; this
is the largest number of onshore wind turbines of any area in Japan. Another 684 more turbines
(total capacity 2.53 GW) are in the works. The governor plans a system to allow communities to
receive fair economical returns.




Japan, EU to set common rules on net-zero programs, public procurement
(Nikkei, April 25)
•  In May, Japan and the EU will agree to set common rules on state programs to support net-zero
initiatives in the private sector and public procurement.
•  Japan has a similar framework with the U.S., aiming to reduce reliance on China for products used

in EV and offshore wind installations.
•  Main points are:
o  Build supply chains based on principles focused on sustainability, etc;
o  Develop principles on critical materials, but pricing is to be excluded;
o  Cooperate with the U.S. and other countries sharing the concept;
o  The principles will be applied to public procurement, subsidies, etc.
•  The agreement aims to reduce reliance on Chinese supplies for EVs, offshore wind equipment etc.,

which may be subsidized by the government in Beijing to realize low prices.
• TAKEAWAY: It may be possible to exclude some generic or commoditized made-in-China products from the
market. But it will be challenging to block Chinese products that are highly innovative and not found in Japan,
EU or the U.S. In some sectors, Chinese companies’ R&D spending exceeds that of Japanese businesses even
without government subsidies. Even in the more commoditized areas, non-Chinese producers will need to
show they have a competitive offering.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan, EU to share EV battery data for recycling
(Nikkei, April 22)
o  Japan’s Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) and its EU counterpart inked a

MoU to share a database of minerals used in EV batteries.
o  It will trace the origins and parties involved in deals associated with battery metals,
namely lithium, in a bid to facilitate recycling in the Japanese and EU markets.
Competition-sensitive data is excluded.
o  Japan’s database, “Ouranos”, has input from 50 companies and organizations; the EU
database “Catena-X”, from 170 companies and organizations.

o  CONTEXT: The data sharing plan came from the need for Japan’s automotive companies
to stay competitive by complying with EU regulations. The agreement includes a mutual
authentication of entries in battery metal databases.
• TAKEAWAY: In a typical mutual authentication agreement with the EU, the parties review each other’s systems
periodically. Extending this framework to hybrid vehicles, as well as drawing a line between “recyclable
minerals” and “chemicals with marginal mineral elements that can’t be recycled”, etc. may be possible

discussion points.

PM Kishida to visit Brazil, sign decarbonization partnership
(Asia Nikkei, April 25)
•  PM Kishida and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva are expected to sign the Green
Partnership Initiative when they meet in Brazil in early May.
•  A delegation of about 40 Japanese companies will accompany Kishida. Biofuel tech development

and deforestation will be major areas of focus.
•  CONTEXT: Brazil is this year's G20 chair, and seeks to be a leader in fighting climate change; in
2025 the country will host COP30.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan Biofuels Supply, a JV of five local oil refineries, currently dominates biofuel import trades.
Market entries triggered by bilateral initiatives will not only change the trade landscape but will also create a
need to explore ways to price biofuel imports. There is no commodity index for the Japanese biofuel market.





Panel reviews Green Innovation Fund power chip, data center projects
(Government statement, April 24)
•  The Green Innovation Fund did an annual review of nine projects to develop next-gen power
chips, SiC wafers and data storage and energy saving systems for data centers.
•  The data center project was told to be more focused on AI-derived issues and that a clear business
scenario for replacing current DRAM and storage memory devices with nanotube RAM (NRAM)
needs to be developed.

•  Power semiconductor chip designs and development of manufacturing lines begin this year, with
work on next-gen central processing unit prototypes in FY2025.
•  CONTEXT: The goals for 2030 are to achieve 50% power efficiency improvements for electronic
devices, and reduce production costs of power chips; and for data centers to realize 40% power
savings by deploying opto-electronics based technologies.




TEPCO Power Grid, Ocean Power Grid to build clean energy supply network
(Government/Company statement, April 24)
•  The Yokohama municipal govt, TEPCO Power Grid and Ocean Power Grid, a subsidiary of PowerX,
signed an MoU on building a power network and a new clean energy supply base in the port of

Yokohama, Kanagawa Pref.
•  The project will examine the possibility of supplying green power derived from offshore wind
power to Yokohama’s port and the construction of power supply facilities to cope with increasing
demand in the waterfront area.
•  The project seeks to make the Yokohama port carbon neutral and to be Japan’s first base to
supply onshore power to large cruise ships.
•  Ocean Power Grid plans to transmit energy derived from offshore wind power using an automated

power transfer vessel, which would be the first such attempt in the world.
•  CONTEXT: Ocean Power Grid is a new, wholly-owned subsidiary of Japanese battery startup
PowerX, set up to take over marine and wind power projects and development of specialized tech.
It will focus on promoting maritime power transmission utilizing battery tankers. It will own, sell,

MoE launches building-integrated solar subsidies
(Association statement, April 23)
•  The MoE launched the first subsidy program to promote building-integrated solar systems to
improve energy resilience.
•  Run by the Environmental Technology Association, the systems need to have over 5 kW output

and to be built into the wall or window parts.
•  Financing will cover up to 60% of window-integrated system and installation costs, or up to ¥50
mln; 50% of wall-integrated costs, or up to ¥30 mln.



MOL installs CO2 capture system, a first for Japan

(Company statement, April 22)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) installed an onboard CO2 capture system with a SOx scrubber on one of
its tankers.
•  This is the first time a Japanese operator has commercially installed such a system, which is made
by Dutch-based Value Maritime.
•  It removes 99% of sulfur SOx and particulate matter (PM) from exhaust gasses. Additionally, it

separates and recovers up to 10% of CO2 emissions.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
MOL is Japan’s first shipper to raise funds through transition linked loan
(Company statement, April 25)
o  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) became the first Japanese shipping company to raise funds
through a syndicated transition linked loan.
o  The loan is from Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Development Bank of Japan, and SBI

Shinsei Bank, and will support MOL's environmental investments.
o  The loan structure adjusts interest rates based on MOL's progress in meeting
predetermined GHG reduction targets.

Okinawa’s caustic soda plant to commercialize hydrogen supply
(Japan NRG, April 22)
•  In 2026, Okinawa-based Showa Chemical Industries will commercialize hydrogen generated at its
caustic soda plant in the city of Uruma.
•  The plant annually emits 31 tons of hydrogen, and 70% goes unused. The gas will be compressed

and stored in a tank to be built by Ryuseki Corp, a gasoline retailer.
•  The hydrogen is certified as “grade 4” (99.9% purity) under the Japan Industrial Standard.
Potential users include Okinawa Electric for co-firing at its thermal power plant. For FCV, the gas
needs to be reformed to achieve the required 99.97% purity.
•  CONTEXT: Presently, Okinawa Electric is conducting field tests of hydrogen-LNG co-firing at its 35
MW Yoshinoura power station. In March, it succeeded in co-firing with 30% hydrogen. The studies

will continue until FY2025.
• TAKEAWAY: The national govt will fund ¥156 mln for building the hydrogen transport and storage facilities,
which equates to ¥354/kg of hydrogen, assuming that the facilities will be used for 20 years. This is just about
at the 2030 target cost of ¥30 /Nm3 set by the govt.




Number of EV charging outlets surpasses 40k, up 25% from a year ago
(Government statement, April 22)
•  In March, the number of EV charging outlets hit 40,323, up from 32,251 a year ago, which is about

a 25% increase. ENEOS led with 6,609 outlets.
•  High-speed charging equipment with 90 kW output or more accounted for about 20%.
•  This year, subsidies for new charging stations will be doubled to ¥36 billion. The 2030 installation
goal is 300,000 outlets.
• TAKEAWAY: EV charging outlet growth has outpaced that of EV sales, which were 40,327 units in FY2023, up
from 35,559 in the previous period. Sparse charging infrastructure was blamed for slow EV sales, which

accounted for only 1.6% of total passenger car sales.




Asahi Kasei to build a lithium-ion battery separator plant in Canada
(Company statement, April 25)
•  Asahi Kasei will build an integrated plant in Ontario, Canada for the base film manufacturing and
coating of wet-process, lithium-ion battery separators.
•  Asahi Kasei plans to manufacture its Hipore™ microporous membrane that provides a barrier
between the positive and negative electrodes in LIBs.

•  It will be in partnership with Honda Motor. Commercial operation is set for 2027.
•  Production capacity will be about 700 million m2 per year, as coated film. The project will receive
funding from the Development Bank of Japan and support from the Canadian govt and the
province of Ontario.

Toyo Engineering, Chubu Electric, Nippon Seisen ink ammonia cracker MoU
(Company statement, April 24)
•  Toyo Engineering, Chubu Electric, Chubu Electric Power Miraiz and Nippon Seisen inked a MoU to
develop small-scale crackers to convert ammonia into hydrogen.
•  Demand for hydrogen as boiler and engine fuel has potential; ammonia could be the best

hydrogen carrier as it can be transported and stored with current technology.
•  Toyo and Nippon Seisen will develop the cracker, and Chubu Electric will study market strategies.
•  CONTEXT: Hydrogen might be better as fuel than ammonia since it’s more flammable; but
ammonia can carry more hydrogen molecules than liquefied or compressed hydrogen, or
methylcyclohexane (MCH).




Ammonia supply chain studies start in Hokkaido
(Company statement, April 25)
•  Hokkaido Electric, IHI, Marubeni, Mitsui & Co, Mitsui Chemicals, and Tomakomai Futo will study
building an ammonia supply chain in Tomakomai, Hokkaido.

•  The focus is on facilities required to import, store and deliver ammonia, and its demand in north
Japan.
•  The group will hold consultations with Kushiro Power Station, Nippon Beet Sugar Manufacturing,
and Oenon Holdings, which are potential ammonia consumers.

BESS wins big in Japan’s first long-term decarbonized power auction

(Japan NRG, April 26)
•  Chugoku Electric became arguably the biggest winner of Japan’s first ever long term decarbonized
power auction after it secured funding for 1.31 GW via a single project – Unit 3 at its Shimane
Nuclear Power Plant. The 1,373 MWe advanced BWR reactor is currently under construction.
Delivery of the capacity is scheduled for FY2027.
•  A total of 42 decarbonized power projects were chosen: 30 of these were BESS, two biomass, one
nuclear, three pumped hydro storage, as well as five projects for thermal turbines modified for co-
firing with ammonia and one for co-firing with hydrogen.
•  The govt also awarded capacity funding to 10 LNG-firing projects with capacities ranging from 463

MW to 615 MW (5.75 GW in total). Operators of those units are: Hokkaido Electric, Tohoku Electric,
KEPCO (3 projects), Chugoku Electric, Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and JERA (2 projects).
•  The tender had several sub-categories, which saw allocations for 1.66 GW of capacity in battery
and pumped hydro storage; and another 826 MW in co-firing projects (coal or natural gas with
ammonia or hydrogen).
•  In terms of capacity, KEPCO won with two large pumped storage projects for its Okutataragi

hydropower station (units 3 and 4), each with an output of 254 MW.
•  In the BESS category, Tokyo-based Hexa Renewables was granted as many as 11 projects across
Japan, with a total capacity of 342 MW including in the cities of Iga (Mie Pref) and Fukuchiyama
(Kyoto Pref).
•  Other firms awarded multiple projects included: BESS developer CHC Japan with four projects
(103 MW in total); and Renova with three projects (165.5 MW).
•  CONTEXT: The auction was held in January 2024 and delivery of the capacity is planned for

FY2027.
•  CONTEXT: Although this is billed as a ‘decarbonization’ tender, LNG projects are eligible to take
part in the auction for another two years, with a cap of 6 GW over the three-year eligible period. A
total of 4 GW was allocated for other sources for FY2023. The govt has said that this was a way to
help procure more baseload capacity for a transition period to lessen the reliance on coal.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite renewables industry concerns that nuclear power would benefit the most from this new

auction, the greatest capacity allocation (outside LNG) actually went to BESS and pumped hydro. The latter
are both geared towards energy storage, rather than generation per se, which highlights the govt’s interest in
securing more energy storage to balance the grid amid a wider rollout of variable renewable energy sources.

The results also indicate a willingness to grant allocations for smaller-scale BESS projects, which should support
the sector as it starts to develop from its low base in Japan. BESS and other energy storage options will likely

have even greater allocations from FY2026 when the govt is due to stop accepting bids for LNG-fired capacity.
With a 20-year guarantee for fixed revenues, the auction is expected to prove a popular option for BESS

operators. While only 24% of BESS bids were successful this time, the fact that 4.56 GW of BESS capacity was
tendered bodes well for the sector’s development over the course of this decade.

MLIT designates Aomori Port and Sakata Port as base ports
(Government statement, April 26)
•  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism designated Aomori Port and Sakata
Port as ‘base ports’ for offshore renewable energy power sites.
•  So far, Japan has selected operators for offshore wind power projects in a total of eight maritime

areas. They are able to use ports that are specifically designated as ‘base ports’ that can handle
the transportation of equipment for renewables facilities, such as offshore wind power stations.
There were five ports (Akita, Noshiro, Kashima, Niigata, and Kitakyushu) with this classification
before the latest decision.
•  CONTEXT: For the installation and maintenance of offshore wind power facilities, piers must have
load-bearing capacity and the space to handle heavy equipment.

• TAKEAWAY: Slowly, the govt is expanding the number of logistical facilities that the offshore wind sector can
utilize, which helps to expand the number of projects that can be developed at any one time in the country.

(Denki Shimbun, April 26)
o  TOCOM has seen trading in futures contracts for this summer jump more than 8 times
the volume of last month thanks to the introduction of a market-maker system. There
were 2,126 contracts traded in the first 24 days of April.
o  The exchange is trialing the system through June, hoping to encourage more hedging

transactions during the summer’s peak electricity demand period.
o  CONTEXT: Market makers step into the market as a counterparty to ensure those
providing bid and ask prices have a trading partner in case there are none available. As
of April, six companies are participating in TOCOM's electricity futures market.




JEPX spot prices halved in 2023 as demand headed downward
(Denki Shimbun, April 23)
•  The JEPX spot market saw contracted volume for FY2023 fall by 17.9% YoY, to 261.49 TWh.
•  This was due to the impact of the end of gross bidding from Oct 2023. The ratio of contracted
volume to electricity demand also fell below 30%.
•  The yearly average price fell by ¥9.67 to ¥10.74. The highest monthly average system price was

¥14.20 in November. While demand increased due to lower temperatures, many power supply
facilities were undergoing inspections and repairs during the off-season.
•  There was also a noticeable drop in electricity demand, YoY, which was 5.1% lower in December,
4.3% lower in January, and 0.1% lower in February.
•  Prices showed a clear trend of being higher in the east and lower in the west. Prices in east Japan
ranged from ¥11.33 to ¥12.20, and in west Japan from ¥9.14 to ¥11.14.

•  Prices in the nine areas peaked on Sept 20-23 at ¥50 due to a decrease in solar power from stormy
weather; also, summer heat was severe and demand did not fall even in the evening.

Trading and power firms join Soros fund to invest in Enechain
(Company statement, April 26)
•  A consortium comprising trading, power and gas firms plans to invest ¥5 billion in startup
Enechain, which runs an online electricity exchange.
•  The goal is to lower wholesale prices and create an environment suitable for small power retailers.

The companies plan more trading on the exchange, as well as to have affiliated power retailers buy
electricity using it.
•  The consortium comprises: JERA, Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, KEPCO and Chubu Electric groups,
Sumitomo and Mitsubishi Corp. It also includes Soros Capital Management, Minerva Growth
Partners and Ireland’s Energia Group.
•  The group will take a 14% stake through a private share placement.

•  CONTEXT: Over the next three years Enechain seeks a tenfold increase in the amount of electricity
traded on its platform to 500 TWh / year, about 60% of Japan's power demand. The exchange
employs mainly forward contracts and provides service to more than 250 firms.



Genkai Town mulls putting hand up to host nuclear waste final disposal site

(Japan NRG, April 26)
•  Genkai Town (Saga Pref) is reviewing a petition to put its hand up as a candidate to host the
country’s future final nuclear waste disposal facility. Genkai hosts a NPP owned by Kyushu Electric
and it would be the first municipality with a nuclear station to also be reviewed as a site for waste
storage.
•  The town’s special committee and then its assembly both voted to move forward with the initiative,

which now has to be approved by the mayor before it is submitted to the national authorities.
Mayor Wakiyama Shintaro has told local media he will decide on this in early May.
•  Saga Pref Governor holds a negative stance on the matter.
•  CONTEXT: Submitting the town as a potential candidate for the site begins a lengthy review
process. The first stage of that is documents-based research. It’s conducted by the Nuclear Waste
Management Organization of Japan (NUMO). During this phase, NUMO considers previously

documented data on the area’s geological features.
• TAKEAWAY: Since NUMO started the search for a final disposal site more than 20 years ago, only two
localities (Suttsu and Kamoenai, both in Hokkaido) have started the process. The Hokkaido municipalities are
now in the second stage of the review process.

Accepting the survey brings state funding to the municipality, which helps revitalize the local economy. Yet,
according to a state map indicating potential waste storage site locations, Genkai is not suitable. Even if the

town’s authorities overcome any opposition from residents and the prefectural governor, and the survey goes
ahead, there’s no guarantee it will ever be completed. The entire three phases could easily take more than 10
years, leaving space for cancellation.

Chugoku Electric begins surveys for spent nuclear fuel interim storage facility
(Company statement, April 23)
•  Chugoku Electric began geological excavation surveys to explore building a spent nuclear fuel
interim storage facility in Kaminoseki, Yamaguchi Pref.
•  CONTEXT: Since August 2023, the company has been conducting preliminary literature research.

This first step studies records of earthquakes, tsunami, and factors like humidity and climate. In
December, the company submitted a forest clearing notification to Kaminoseki and began cutting
the forest.
• TAKEAWAY: The Kaminoseki interim storage facility is crucial for both Chugoku Electric and KEPCO. If the
surveys continue and the facility is built, Chugoku Electric could use it for its Shimane NPP. Also, it can help
KEPCO fulfill promises to ship spent nuclear fuel out of the prefecture – promises that underpin its current NPP

operations.




Survey indicates significant advantages in restarting Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP
(Nikkei, April 24)
•  Nomura Research Institute assessed the economic impact of restarting Units 6 and 7 at
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP. It analyzed three scenarios: restart, decommissioning, and complete
shutdown.
•  Restarting the plant could bring ¥440 billion in economic gains over 10 years; compared to ¥298

billion if there's a shutdown; and ¥126 billion if decommissioned. Over 10 years, revenue from
taxes and subsidies totalled ¥322 billion in the first scenario.
•  Niigata Pref’s governor said these surveys are important for discussions, but economic profits are
not the only thing to consider.




KEPCO’s Mihama NPP Unit 3 meets standards for long-term operations
(Company statement, April 25)
•  KEPCO said most of Mihama NPP Unit 3 meets long-term operations standards.
•  The International Atomic Energy Agency also agreed, with a review conducted by its long-term
operation team SALTO. Yet, it had recommendations for more inspections and some improvement

works.
•  While compliance with SALTO safety standards is not a condition for operation, KEPCO had
requested it.
•  CONTEXT: KEPCO has resumed operation of Unit 3, which in 2021 was Japan’s first NPP to
exceed 40 years of service.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
KEPCO to resume operations at Takahama NPP Unit 4

(Company statement, April 22)
o  On May 21, KEPCO will resume operations of Unit 4 at the Takahama NPP (Fukui Pref),

Mitsui & Co. might join $7 billion LNG project in UAE
(Nikkei, April 23)
•  Mitsui & Co. is exploring whether to join a $7 billion LNG project in Ruwais, UAE. This would be in

collaboration with ADNOC and other international partners.
•  The project will begin operations by 2030, producing about 10 million tons of LNG per year. It
could cover 15% of Japan's yearly demand.
•  Mitsui's investment could be 10%, with ADNOC owning 60%. Other partners include Shell, BP, and
TotalEnergies. They’ll sell the LNG to customers in Europe and Asia.
•  CONTEXT: Recently, ADNOC inked a deal with Germany’s SEFE for 1 Mtpa of LNG over 15 years.

This follows a similar deal with China’s ENN Natural Gas.
• TAKEAWAY: After Nikkei reported the discussions of this deal, Mitsui issued a statement saying a final decision
has not been made. One is likely to be made in May. If so, it would mark a slight resurgence in Japanese LNG
investment over the past six months or so. In early April, Mitsui’s biggest domestic rival, Mitsubishi Corp,
agreed to invest in MidOcean Energy, an LNG firm owned by U.S investor EIG and with stakes in a number of
Australian LNG projects. In February, JERA committed $1.4 billion to the Scarborough gas project in northwest
Australia that’s being developed by Woodside Energy, following a $880 million investment in the same project

by LNG Japan, the JV between trading houses Sumitomo Corp and Sojitz. Mitsui itself extended its
involvement in an Oman LNG project just in October 2023.

Such a concerted effort to invest in new and existing projects, which has included several in the U.S., suggests
that Japanese buyers see a slightly different demand picture to the one painted in the country’s Basic Energy
Plan. The current version of the Plan says LNG use in power generation will drop by half by the end of this
decade in Japan. The Plan is due to be revised this year.





METI forecasts double-digit drop in industrial fuel oil demand in FY2028
(Government statement, April 26)
•  METI’s long-term refined oil products demand forecast over FY2024-2028 showed that steep
declines of 16.3-19.1% are expected from sulfur fuel oil, also called heavy oil; with a decline of only
1.4% for jet fuel and naphtha.
•  The energy transition, as well as declining population, will propel the shift away from fossil oil. IMO

rules on ship fuel, changes in freight industry practices, and the shift away from plastics, will also
have an impact.
•  In FY2028, the total oil products demand is seen at 132 million kiloliters (829 million barrels), down
7.6% from 143 million kl in FY2023. The figures do not include liquefied petroleum gas.

LNG stocks are up 26% from last week, but down 16% YoY

(Government data, April 24)
•  As of April 21, LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 2.05 mln tons, up 26.5% WoW (1.62 mln tons).
But this is 16% down from the end of April (2.44 mln tons) in 2023, and 1.49% down on the past
five-year average of 2.02 mln tons.
•  Golden Week began and many companies will close their offices from April 27 to May 6. During
May to July, the temperatures are expected to be higher than average, especially in southern
Japan and Okinawa, with sunny and dry days. The rainy season is forecast to begin in June, except

in the Tohoku and Hokkaido areas.

ANALYSIS

BY JOHN VAROLI
Blue vs Green Hydrogen and its Impact on JERA

The debate over the economic feasibility of ‘blue hydrogen’ versus ‘green hydrogen’
appears to be approaching a decisive moment in the global conversation about clean
forms of energy. And developments in the U.S., specifically the State of Texas, are at
the center of this issue.

Those espousing green hydrogen say that the best solution is to focus on total
emission reductions from the very start. Meanwhile proponents of blue hydrogen say
that it’s more important to allow low-carbon facilities and infrastructure to be built and
scaled quickly.

In the past few months, private opinions have made their way into the public realm,
with directors of major legacy energy companies criticizing green hydrogen as
economically infeasible because of high production costs.

Instead, they’re pushing for blue hydrogen as a low-carbon solution to meet current
market demands. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas, while green hydrogen,
which has more backing from G7 governments, relies on electrolyzing water with solar
or wind power. Hydrogen and ammonia do not emit CO2 when burned.


How this issue pans out will impact Japan’s power sector in general and Japan’s
largest utility, JERA, in particular, as it envisions upgrading coal-powered thermal
plants to run on ammonia. JERA needs the ammonia to have as little carbon footprint
as possible to claim that its strategy is “clean”. But it also needs the new fuel to be
affordable and available at scale. As such, the outcome of the debate in Texas will
have a bearing on both the economics and the optics of Japan’s power sector
decarbonization.

Ammonia co-firing with coal
JERA, which is a 50/50 joint venture between TEPCO and Chubu Electric, produces
nearly 30% of all electricity in Japan. The company has 26 coal-fired power plants,
mostly in and near the cities of Tokyo, Kawasaki, Yokohama, and Nagoya.

At the start of this month, JERA started what it claims is a world-first demonstration of
the co-firing of ammonia and coal at a large-scale, commercial thermal power plant.
Should it go well, by 2027 JERA aims to implement ammonia co-firing on a regular,
commercial basis at its Hekinan power station.

In 2028, the ratio of ammonia in the fuel mix at one of the units of the Hekinan power
station would be raised to 50%. JERA wants to gradually increase the ammonia ratio,
eventually reaching 100% in all its coal power plants at home, and possibly export the
technology to countries in Southeast Asia. The timeline on these plans extends into
the 2030s.

While JERA is also actively expanding into renewable energy, and launched its brand
new global renewables subsidiary JERA Nex earlier this month, the company’s

22

decarbonization strategy largely rests on shifting existing thermal plants from fossil
fuels to clean-burning ammonia or hydrogen. To do that, JERA needs to create a
global ammonia supply chain since the vast majority of the ammonia produced today
is used to make fertilizer and there’s little spare capacity at existing facilities.

Toward that goal, JERA has inked a number of deals with major ammonia producers.
Of these, just one is for green ammonia – the agreement with India’s ReNew E-Fuels.
The scale, however, is relatively small: just 100,000 tons of ammonia / year.

All the other projects that JERA has explored to date are based on the ‘blue’
approach, which involves steam reforming of natural gas, and capturing the CO2
that’s created in the process.

In the blue ammonia space, JERA has many more options in terms of suppliers and
volumes. JERA is in talks with the world's top ammonia producer, CF Industries in the
U.S., and Yara Clean Ammonia, a unit of Norwegian chemicals giant Yara
International. Both are planning new ammonia production lines situated along the U.S.
Gulf coast, each possibly producing more than one million tons annually.

JERA might take a stake in the Gulf coast projects, as well as sign an offtake contract
for as much as half a million tons of ammonia a year. JERA Chairman Kani said that
he’d like to see "at least double-digits" stakes when investing in U.S. ammonia
projects.


The project that has perhaps become the focal point in the blue versus green
ammonia / hydrogen discussion, however, is ExxonMobil’s Baytown Complex in
Texas, where JERA is also exploring participation. That project hopes to produce
900,000 tons of hydrogen per year, which would be used to produce about one
million tons of ammonia.

ExxonMobil claims that the Baytown Complex will be the world’s largest facility of its
kind, and hopes to begin production as soon as 2028. But the multi-billion-dollar
investment decision on the project depends in large part on how much the operator
can secure in U.S. subsidies. According to ExxonMobil, it needs the subsidies for its
blue project to be closer to what the government offers for green projects.

If Exxon wins, this could help decide the outcome of the blue versus green ammonia
debate, at least for the near-term. If they lose, companies like JERA might slow their
shift from coal to ammonia, fearing a lack of adequate (and affordable) supply.

Color hydrogens do battle
When JERA announced plans to start commercial-scale co-firing at one of the units of
its Hekinan coal power plant, it put out a contract offer in 2022 for 500,000 tons of
ammonia supply per year. This was possibly the largest ever ammonia contract
outside of the fertilizer sector. And yet, this volume would only cover one year of
operations at one unit of one thermal power plant at the co-firing ratio of 20%
ammonia - 80% coal. Effectively, ammonia would fuel 200 MW of capacity.

For the power company to ramp up to 50% ammonia firing, and to spread the
technology to other thermal power plants, it will need to lock in a serious amount of

fuel supply. Projects like the Baytown Complex offer this kind of scale, but according
to Exxon it needs tax credits for it to work commercially.

The U.S. government’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed to address this exact
issue – of bridging the cost gap with existing fuel sources. However, the IRA strongly
favors green hydrogen. Under the IRA, the amount of tax credit declines as CO2
emissions increase during production. Exxon wants the IRA to treat blue and green
hydrogen as equals.

Move now or wait for Green H2?
Over the past several months the heads of major companies such as Exxon, Saudi
Aramco and trading company Gunvor have gone public with their thoughts that the
high cost of green hydrogen production will prevent it from displacing oil and natural
gas any time soon. And waiting for green H2 to arrive would delay the energy
transition.

Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser says that the cost of green hydrogen is equivalent to
$400 for a barrel of oil, which is roughly four times the current price. To make green
H2 work, it needs sizable state incentives and offtake agreements of at least 15 years.

Meanwhile, Exxon CEO Darren Woods told the CERAWeek energy conference that
clients were not yet prepared to pay for the costs associated with emissions
reductions. As such, Woods said he could only see Exxon producing hydrogen if the
IRA guidelines were amended to allow tax credits for methane-derived hydrogen.


International fertilizers and chemicals giant OCI Global said resolutely that it will move
forward with hydrogen, but in its ‘blue’ format. The company is building one of the
world’s largest blue hydrogen-derived ammonia plants in Texas, to cost nearly $1
billion.

“We’re not going to pause our business just to wait for this technology [green
hydrogen] to scale, which we think will take five or ten years,” said Bashir Lebada,
head of OCI’s methanol and fuels business.

Conclusion
As a buyer, rather than producer, JERA and other Japanese companies that are keen
to use ammonia are largely agnostic on the colors of hydrogen and the production
methods. At the same time, Japanese buyers can only invest in and sign offtake deals
with projects that are deemed feasible and that deliver at scale.

Whether blue ammonia or hydrogen emerges victorious in the U.S. thanks to the
lobbying efforts of Exxon is not something that Japanese buyers will affect. Still, the
desire of JERA and others to move to ammonia firing sooner, rather than later, could
play a role in the debate.

The irony of ever greater pressure on companies to decarbonize quickly may be that it
brings more ‘blue’ options to the fore as realistic pathways, while pushing ‘green’
options into a supporting role.

BOX: The math of subsidies
The Department of Energy has said it will award up to $8 billion in grant funding to
develop several hydrogen hubs across the U.S. In December of last year, the IRA set
up a Clean Hydrogen Production Credit program that has four technology-neutral
credit tiers based on the emissions rate of various hydrogen production processes.

To qualify, hydrogen must be produced with less than four kilos of CO2-equivalent
per kilo of hydrogen. The guidelines on production, however, only refers to green
hydrogen.

The credits are offered only to projects that can begin construction by 2033, and are
valid for 10 years starting when a hydrogen production facility enters service. The
credit ranges from $0.60 to $3 per kilo of hydrogen produced, depending on the
lifecycle emissions of the hydrogen production.



















The U.S. energy strategy calls for hydrogen to be produced for $1 per kilo by 2031.
Today, the levelized cost of green hydrogen is over $4 per kilogram, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance, but it could meet the national target should the
project qualify for the maximum credit amount.


In the case of blue hydrogen, however, most projects would only be able to qualify for
a tax credit of up to $1 per kilo, bringing the cost range of blue H2 to $1.0-$1.5 per
kilo. As such, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that most blue hydrogen will
exceed the $1 target by 2031. The DOE also casts doubt on whether most blue
projects will meet the criteria for ‘clean hydrogen’ and thus qualify for credits.

The saving grace for blue hydrogen, however, may be an additional tax credit known
as 45Q, which provides up to $85 per ton of CO2 that’s captured and permanently
stored. Making the subsidies math work will be Exxon’s priority in the coming year or
so.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
How Japanese Steel is Turning Green

Part II : Reducing the Problem to its Core
If Japan’s fully behind a hydrogen economy, then it’s even more fully behind a net-
zero shift in steelmaking. For all the headlines around the ‘hydrogen economy’, the
steel sector is due to get almost 50% more government green R&D funding (¥427
billion) over the course of the next ten years.

Of course, hydrogen will play a vital role in the transformation of steelmaking from the
centuries-old process based on coking coal. But it’s not the only component in what is
widely touted as the age of ‘green steel’. A number of innovations are in the works in
Japan’s steel factories, both in heat control, emissions absorption, and power sources.

Nearly all the new technologies proposed and tested are still in the pilot and
demonstration stage, but the development is further advanced than most realize. One
of the biggest factors that will influence the next steps in ‘green steelmaking’ is the
persistent conundrum of price. After all, technological breakthroughs will mean
nothing if they can’t find willing clients and supportive governments.


In this second part of the “Green Steel in Japan” series, we look at how the steel
sector and the government are wrestling with obvious disparities between what they
‘need’ the price of clean steel technologies to look like and what they are in practice.
The next few years require radical mind shifts, either on the side of producers or
buyers, or both.

Another way to make steel
In the first part of this series, we looked at the way the majority of steel is produced in
Japan – via iron ore use in blast furnaces. There is another steelmaking process that
involves hydrogen that’s known as direct iron reduction (DRI). This approach uses shaft
furnaces, which operate at a lesser temperature than the blast furnaces, but still
require 900-1,000 C.

The DRI method relies much more on hydrogen as the sole agent for iron reduction.
In this approach, the natural gases in the furnace comprise 60-80% hydrogen.
Presently, around 10% of the world’s steel is made using natural gas as a reducing
agent. It’s especially popular in the Middle East and the U.S. where natural gas is
abundant.

In Japan, JFE Steel tested natural gas-triggered reduction two decades ago but
stopped due to economic reasons. However, Japanese steelmakers have access to
this technology overseas. Kobe Steel’s U.S. affiliate Midrex Technologies is the world’s
largest shaft furnace builder. Kobe acquired Midrex in 1983.

Last year, the Japanese steel sector became more active in examining how DRI could
be more widely used. Kobe Steel tested how the technology can be applied to its
Japanese blast furnace-dominated facilities. The company used DRI at its Kakogawa
furnace, deploying the method to pre-treat iron instead of iron ore. As a result, Kobe

26

Steel reported a 25% CO2 reduction compared to the usual process of treating iron
ore from scratch.

Meanwhile, JFE Steel has started construction of a small 15 kg of iron ore per hour
shaft furnace at its Chiba Works, and plans to begin test runs in FY2024. In 2025,
Nippon Steel will set up a 1 ton per hour shaft furnace at the Hasaki R&D Center.

Quality issues
Ore quality is a major challenge for Japanese steel firms keen to employ DRI. Ore with
a high iron content of 62-65% fits DRI better. Such ores are found in the Nordic
regions and South America. Japanese firms, however, tend to import Australian and
Brazilian ores of grades that are in the region of 58-65% iron content, and these are
less suitable for DRI.

The above is one region where European competitors such as Thyssenkrupp and
SAAB have raced ahead in green steelmaking. With better access to DRI-ready ores,
Thyssenkrupp and SAAB say they can commercialize green steel that uses hydrogen
as early as 2026-27.

Barring a complete switch of iron ore supplies, which would be a multi-year and vastly
expensive process, Japanese steelmakers need to make the DRI process work with the
raw materials that they can already access. As such, JFE Steel has embarked on
experimentation of DRI with ores of lower iron content (i.e., 58-62%). It has been the
most adventurous of Japan’s steel firms in this regard, trialing tactics such as directly
feeding low-grade chromite and molybdenum concentrates into the furnaces to
compensate for weaker iron concentration.


Unfortunately for JFE, this approach has not yet yielded fruit. It has resulted in massive
releases of sulfuric gas, and so the steelmaker has to find other options.

Other technological steps also need revising. The process after removing oxygen from
iron ore also needs a re-think. After heating, the metallic iron in blast furnaces melts
and becomes more malleable. The hot near-liquid metal can be easily moved to the
next process of refining, rolling and shaping. Meanwhile, iron created with hydrogen
treatment is not as easily manageable.

Last year, a new project was added to the Green Innovation Fund program, which is
to develop a new furnace called a “melter” for treating the iron after DRI. Over the
past winter, the government solicited proposals from companies keen to develop such
a new furnace, and in April awarded the project to Nippon Steel and The Japan
Research and Development Center for Metals.

FY2028 is the deadline to complete development of an 880,000 ton per year DRI
production process and equipment. GIF will provide ¥23 billion. By 2030, the Super
Course50 method should be operational at Nippon Steel’s Kimitsu Works and
Course50 elsewhere.

Calculating H2 demand
Whichever approach Japanese steelmakers use – DRI, Course50, or similar – the
common component underpinning the plans is hydrogen.

27



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The Japan Iron and Steel Federation (JISF) believes that steelmakers will need 1,000
Nm3 (90 kg) of hydrogen for one ton of steel in blast furnaces, while DRI would
require an additional “several hundred Nm3”.

These numbers are higher than the estimates for hydrogen-based green steelmaking
in Europe, with the EU studies quoting figures as low as 50 kg. However, each
company’s furnaces are set up differently, and the quality of iron ore, as well as other
processes, can impact hydrogen requirements.

- Assuming that Nippon Steel fully switches its 5.7-million-ton a year Kimitsu Works
to the Super Course50 method, it would require about 500,000 tons of hydrogen
a year.
- Based on JISF guidance, Japan NRG assumes that the DRI process in Japan
would require 1,300 Nm3 (117 kg) for one ton of steel. That would mean that a
one-million ton per year shaft furnace needs 100,000 tons per year of hydrogen.

These numbers are, of course, a maximum projection. Actual demand would be much
lower since blast furnaces with current Japanese technologies would not run on 100%
hydrogen.


Cost
JISF also says that the steel sector needs hydrogen prices at ¥8/ Nm3, which is less
than half of the already low ¥20/ Nm3 government target for 2050. The numbers are
completely divorced from the current prices offered by hydrogen producers, which
see even the government’s target as already unrealistic under today’s costs.

One way that the market and steel companies may bridge this gap, however, is by
changing the criteria for what kind of hydrogen is needed for steelmaking.

Blast furnaces are inhibited by various gases. As such, unlike fuel cells, furnaces do not
require hydrogen of 99.97-99.99% purity. They may tolerate 80% hydrogen so long as
it is sulfur-free. This opens opportunities for producers to make cheaper, low-purity
gas that would create a new tier in the hydrogen market.

If this tier gains momentum, through being accessible in price for Japanese
steelmakers, this could become the hydrogen product that is more likely to drive near-
term demand, and thus act as a benchmark for both low and high-purity hydrogen
contracts in Asia.

It’s likely that the European and North American markets will evolve differently, due to
their widespread plans for DRI based on higher iron ore grades. Still, even those steel
producers will have to adapt. The world’s iron ore deposits tend to average 56-57%.

Similarly, there is a lack of clarity over the type of hydrogen required for DRI that JFE
Steel plans to explore in its studies around low-grade iron ores.

Japanese steelmakers building DRI-enabled shaft furnaces may use natural gas as the
reduction agent in the interim until hydrogen prices reach realistic levels. This could

lead the steel sector to pursue a similar kind of dual-fuel strategy to that currently
tested by the power generation sector.

High hydrogen costs could also push steelmakers to increase their reliance on carbon
capture. According to the 2021 Japan Science and Technology Agency policy
proposal, the estimated cost of carbon capture and separation is ¥15/ kg, provided
that carbon released at blast furnaces is captured fully.

The cost of pig iron production, without carbon capture, was ¥40-50/ kg. Reducing
the capture cost will definitely help make Japanese steel greener.

Conclusion
With so many variables, it’s too early to call what ‘green steelmaking’ will eventually
look like, with many regional and company variations. The multitude of approaches
shows that there are at least a few pathways to reducing the CO2 footprint of the
steel sector and that these may be more local than global.

Japan’s steelmakers are likely to continue signaling their intent to move towards a
hydrogen-based future for their industry. But they know that they have (and must
pursue) other options. The technological battle is still wide open.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

ASEAN / Energy transition
Regional collaboration through power interconnectors, hydrogen networks and
energy storage could reduce the cost of decarbonisation among ASEAN member
states by $800 billion, says a report by DNV.

Australia / Renewable energy
The govt launched a 6 GW renewable energy tender for the National Electricity
Market under the Capacity Investment Scheme, the country’s largest renewables
tender. About 2.2 GW of capacity, which could power over one million households, is
planned for New South Wales.

China / Carbon market
Fitch Ratings said that China’s government could reduce the free emission allowance
for key emitters and place a cap on the quote that can be carried over to 2025. The
expected tightening of China’s national carbon market could drive demand for
renewable energy.

China / Coal power
China’s coal-fired power sector is set for another year of profit as coal prices drop,
reports S&P Global Ratings. Spot coal prices domestically and internationally were
down by about 11% due to abundant supply. In Q1 of 2023, the average spot price
was 4% to 5% lower than 2023’s annual average.

EVs
In 2024, EV sales in China are projected to reach 10 million, about 45% of total car
sales. In the U.S., about 11% of cars sold are expected to be EV. In Europe, despite
the phase-out of subsidies, EVs might account for about 25% of cars sold.

Indonesia / Energy transition
The country’s sovereign wealth fund, the Indonesia Investment Authority, will invest
up to $1 billion in 2024. Green energy will be a priority, such as investment in the EV
ecosystem and geothermal energy, and financing early retirement of coal-fired power
plants.

Malaysia / Oil & Gas
Malaysia's Sapura Energy will sell its entire 50% stake in oil and gas upstream
company SapuraOMV to TotalEnergies for $705 million. The deal, which includes a
cash payment of $530 million, will leave TotalEnergies as the sole owner of
SapuraOMV

Offshore wind
The global offshore wind sector added an additional 9.8 GW capacity in 2023, across
25 new offshore wind farms, according to World Forum Offshore Wind. In 2022, that
figure was 9.4 GW. Now the total global offshore wind capacity is 67.4 GW.

South Korea / Oil & Gas
The Korea Energy Terminal, a JV between Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) and utility
SK Gas, launched a new oil and gas import facility. Located in the Ulsan Free
Economic Zone, the facility will also become a center for hydrogen technology
development.

Taiwan / Offshore wind
Ørsted launched the Greater Changhua 1 and 2a offshore wind farm, with a total
installed capacity of 900 MW, making it East Asia's largest offshore wind project.
