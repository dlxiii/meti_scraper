NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


Japan to pioneer deep-sea rare-earth extraction

(Nikkei Asia, July 1)
•  Japan will launch a pilot in January 2026 to extract rare earth minerals from seabed mud near
Minami-Torishima Island, 1,950 km southeast of Tokyo.
•  At about 5,500 meters below the ocean surface, nearly 35 tons of mud will be collected, marking the
world's first extraction from such depths.
•  The area is estimated to hold around 16 Mt of rare earths, including key minerals like dysprosium
used in EV motors and gadolinium used in nuclear reactors.
•  A second, larger extraction trial is planned for FY2027, including a local refinery to simplify
transport and processing.
• TAKEAWAY: Rare earths are crucial for magnets and many auto and electronics devices that Japanese firms
produce. Though only small volumes are needed, the lack of these elements can result in production stoppages –
as automakers like Suzuki recently experienced. Japan’s program to secure rare earths separately from China,
which dominates the supply chain for these raw materials, has been in the works for well over a decade but so
far it has focused on finding sources in allied nations. This is the first significant effort to secure rare earths
within Japan’s territory. Building domestic production – including processing facilities – will take many years,
but there’s been progress in this area in the last year or so.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Machinery firm develops prototypes for subsea rare earth extraction
(Nikkei Asia, July 3)
o  Furukawa is developing prototype equipment to mine rare-earth elements and rare metals
from the ocean floor, leveraging its terrestrial mining expertise.
o  Furukawa holds about 20 maritime-mining patents, comprising 30% of Japan's total.
o  A dedicated team of about 10 specialists was set up in 2023, marking the firm’s decision to
accelerate commercialization in this sector.
o  CONTEXT: Japan’s seabed was found to hold nickel and cobalt ores, as well as rare-earth
elements. JOGMEC is the main state entity involved in searching and mining such elements.
Furukawa developed technology, such as hydraulic crawler drills, for seabed mining partly with
JOGMEC’s support.



TEPCO to include electricity supply to data centers in growth strategy

(Nikkei, July 4)
•  Supplying power to data centers will be key for TEPCO’s medium- to long-term growth. This plan
was presented to TEPCO’s largest shareholder – the Nuclear Damage Compensation and
Decommissioning Facilitation Corp (NDF).
•  TEPCO will strengthen its power transmission network for data centers and semiconductor plants to
meet rising electricity demand nationwide.
•  The operating committee of NDF meets on a regular basis to evaluate TEPCO’s financial
performance. TEPCO’s revised Comprehensive Special Business Plan is still being prepared. The
document was expected in FY2024, but faces delays due to many uncertainties, especially about
TEPCO’s nuclear facilities.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JERA: new thermal plants needed amid rising demand
(Denki Shimbun, June 30)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  JERA’s President Okuda said the digital transformation is driving electricity demand, and
surpasses what energy efficiency measures can offset. Thus, new thermal power plants must
be built.
o  He emphasized the need for flexible capacity to balance renewable variability, and
commented on offshore wind auctions, urging fair competition amid policy shifts.



NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS



Electricity futures trading area to expand to Chubu Region
(Nikkei, July 4)
•  Japan’s electricity futures trading area will soon expand to the Chubu region.
•  Despite significant electricity demand from industries like automotive and households, those seeking
to hedge risks in the electricity market have so far been limited to trading contracts for the Tokyo
and Kansai regions, resulting in substantial price disparities with Chubu’s physical electricity prices.
•  Anticipating demand from businesses for hedging and traders leveraging regional price differences,
exchanges are moving to list new futures products.
•  CONTEXT: Electricity futures are derivative transactions that allow trading electricity at a fixed price
for a future date, such as a year ahead. They settle the price difference with spot electricity traded on
platforms like the JEPX. By trading futures in advance, sellers can lock in sale prices, while buyers can
avoid unexpected procurement cost increases.
•  TOCOM is considering listing electricity futures for the Chubu region, in addition to the existing
East (Tokyo) and West (Kansai) area contracts. These will include “monthly” and “annual”
contracts.
•  The EEX might also expand its coverage to the Chubu region.
•  JEPX’s June spot prices averaged ¥12.9/ kWh in Tokyo, ¥11 in Chubu, and ¥10.6 in Kansai, making
Chubu area pricing in between that of Tokyo and Kansai..
• TAKEAWAY: Price differences arise due to regional variations in power sources and constraints in inter-regional
transmission capacity that limit the amount of electricity transferable between areas. Capturing these nuances
makes for a more effective hedging tool for power producers and retailers.



June spot market volume rises with surging demand

(Denki Shimbun, July 4)
•  In June, the JEPX spot market average daily transaction volume rose 10.4% MoM to 743.1 GWh,
surpassing a prior month’s performance for the first time in four months.
•  Unusually warm weather led to rising temperatures and a sharp spike in electricity demand. Tight
supply-demand conditions persisted until late June, as power sources under maintenance or repair
had not fully resumed operation.
•  The total monthly transaction volume rose 6.8% MoM to 22.23 TWh, accounting for 32.9% of all
national electricity demand, down 2 percentage points.
•  The average daily electricity demand across nine areas nationwide surged 17% MoM and 5% YoY.
•  The 24-hour average rose ¥1.95 to ¥10.87; the daytime average climbed ¥3.14 to ¥11.64; and the
peak average increased ¥3.75 to ¥10.67.
•  The highest actual price recorded in June was ¥34.71 – in Chubu, Hokuriku, and Kansai areas on
June 23 from 10:30 AM to noon, and June 24 from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM.

OCCTO prepares draft for LTDA and main capacity market auctions
(Agency statement, June 26)
•  OCCTO prepared draft application guidelines for the FY2025 capacity market main auction and the
long-term decarbonized power sources auction (LTDA).
•  Key points for the auction are: allowing participation by “zero-premium projects” that bid ¥3/ kWh
in the national offshore wind power tender and also giving dispatchable power sources priority
contracts based on performance in efficiency tests.
•  On the demand curve, target procurement volume for bids is 190 GW; the reference price
(NetCONE) necessary to encourage new development is set at ¥10,075/ kW. However, these figures
will be finalized after consultation with the national advisory committee and are scheduled to be

published between late July and early August.
•  Participant registration for the main auction is planned for August–September, with the bidding
period scheduled for October.
•  For the LTDA, participant registration is expected to begin around October 2025, with bidding
scheduled for January 2026.
•  CONTEXT: Regarding capacity market auctions, including the LTDA, the final version of the application
guidelines will be prepared by taking into account public opinions during the draft stage, before the
actual call for participants begins.



OCCTO announces weekly reserve margin for summer
(Agency statement, June 27)
•  As part of its electricity supply-demand monitoring for the summer, OCCTO began publishing the
reserve margin for the following week every Friday.
•  For the period from June 30 to July 4, the lowest projected reserve margin is 9.1% in the Tohoku,
Tokyo, and Chubu areas on July 1.
•  Although demand is expected to rise due to the end of the rainy season announced in western
Japan, supply capacity has also increased compared to the previous and the week before last,
resulting in an interregional reserve margin exceeding 8%.
•  Taking into account the capacity of additional power sources that can be activated, the reserve
margin is expected to exceed 14% in all areas.
•  CONTEXT: OCCTO provides information on interregional reserve margins via its online “Cross-regional
Reserve Margin Web Publication System.” This system visualizes weekly reserve margins for both
nationwide and regional power supply-demand conditions, helping to foresee supply-demand tightness.
This is important from the perspective of maintaining a stable electricity supply.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kansai Electric secures power for supply-demand balance
(Company statement, July 1)
o  Based on OCCTO instructions, Kansai TSO received electricity from Chubu TSO to improve
its power supply-demand balance – up to 1.49 GW was received between 14:30 and 17:00,
and 330 MW between 17:00 and 18:30.
o  Due to increased electricity demand caused by high temperatures and a reduction in

capacity due to some power plant problems, without an intervention the Kansai regional
reserve margin was seen falling below 3%.
o  CONTEXT: OCCTO directs TSOs to provide cross-regional power interchange when power
supply-demand becomes tight in a particular supply area.

EGC decides to discontinue gross bidding system
(Government statement, June 27)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) officially decided to discontinue the
gross bidding system, which had been suspended.
•  CONTEXT: Gross bidding began in April 2017 in which the EPCOs would release a certain volume of
electricity – originally traded within their own corporate groups – into the wholesale electricity market.
Three key benefits were expected: (1) improving market liquidity, (2) suppressing price volatility, and
(3) enhancing transparency. But over the years, the system was not utilized as much as expected and
critics said it had many issues.
• TAKEAWAY: The rationale for the gross bidding system has likely passed. At the time of the liberalization of the
electricity market, major EPCOs commanded an overwhelming share of power generation, and their retail

divisions also retained a significant market share. EPCOs conducted almost all transactions related to the power
they generated with their own group firms or related entities. That left only a relatively small surplus for the
wholesale electricity market. As such, there was a shortage of tradable volumes for many new market entrants /
retailers, which were at a significant disadvantage. The gross bidding system was introduced to counter this
issue and was effective at the time. However, over recent years it was found to be less and less effective.



Fuel cost adjustments cut August power rates for major utilities
(Denki Shimbun, June 30)
•  Nine of the 10 major utilities (EPCOs) will lower their August electricity fuel cost adjustments,
driven by declining prices of coal (-7.2%), LNG (-3.0%), crude oil (-4.2%), and a stronger yen to the
dollar.
•  Kansai Electric remains unchanged due to sustained fuel cost adjustment caps.
•  CONTEXT: Government electricity bill subsidies have resumed, lowering average electricity bills across
all utilities. In July, subsidies cut the average household monthly bill by between ¥520 (Kansai) and
¥691 (Okinawa).
•  City gas providers will also mark their third consecutive monthly decrease in August due to fuel cost
adjustments, similarly supported by renewed government subsidies.



JERA Cross launches solar P2P power trading trial

(Company statement, July 1)
•  JERA Cross, a decarbonization consultancy subsidiary of JERA, began a peer-to-peer (P2P)
electricity trading trial in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, supplying surplus residential solar power in the
community using technology from TRENDE.
•  The trial involves about 300 participants (200 sellers generating power, and 100 buyer households)
and will continue through March 2027.
•  Coordinated with Setagaya Ward and agricultural cooperative groups Zen-Noh and Zen-Noh
Energy, the trial incorporates demand response measures and rewards participants with digital local
currency.
•  The initiative aims to demonstrate local energy self-sufficiency, addressing challenges such as grid
balance fluctuations and rising electricity prices.
•  CONTEXT: Peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading allows consumers and small-scale producers (e.g.,
homes with rooftop solar) to trade electricity directly among themselves without going through
traditional utilities or intermediaries.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: P2P promoters point to several reasons why this niche can benefit Japan. For one, it is usually
applied to local projects and renewable energy sources, bolstering the nation’s efforts in green power and
regional resilience. P2P can also be used to help balance the grid in times of oversupply, which again fits with
the theme of supporting the growth of renewables. How much these technologies can facilitate demand-
response and lower prices is something that trials like the one in Tokyo seek to demonstrate. If successful, the
trials will likely be expanded to other communities and especially micro grid systems.

METI gives outlook on strategy for oil and LPG reserves

(Government statement, June 30)
•  METI’s subcommittee on oil and LPG noted that LPG supply sources have shifted from the Middle
East to North America, while demand rises across Asia.
•  METI also noted that Japan has a growing need for energy during natural disasters, thus it made its
first release of strategic oil reserves.
•  The 7th Strategic Energy Plan recognizes declining domestic oil demand, but reserves remain
important in light of geopolitical risks and growing demand across APAC.
•  The govt plans to improve flexibility of reserve release options, and the sites of reserves will be
decentralized. During emergencies, priority will be given to more flexible storage sites.
•  LPG is a low-emission fossil fuel, used by about 40% of Japanese households. Over 90% of LPG
imports come from the U.S., Canada, and Australia.
•  To ensure readiness, the govt aims to maintain current reserve levels, both state and private
stockpiles.
•  Japan also seeks more cooperation with oil-producing and Asian consumer countries.

NEWS:    CARBON      CAPTURE      & SYNTHETIC       FUELS



METI begins detailed design of carbon market
(Denki Shimbun, July 3)
•  METI began designing Japan’s emissions trading system (GX-ETS), and launched working groups on
allocation rules. Key topics include setting a 10% cap on carbon credit usage, and establishing
verification bodies.
•  Benchmarks for power generation and manufacturing sectors will be developed. There will be a
phased implementation starting 2026.



Petronas advances CCS projects with JGC, JAPEX, Mitsui
(Nikkei, July 1)
•  Petronas is accelerating CCS efforts with Japanese and global firms such as JGC Holdings, JAPEX,
Mitsui & Co, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil.
•  By 2030, it plans three CCS hubs in Malaysia to accept and store CO2 from both local and overseas,
creating a new revenue stream while reducing reliance on oil and gas.

•  The first domestic CCS project will start later this year, using offshore depleted gas fields. The three
hubs – in Borneo, north and south Peninsular Malaysia – will have a combined storage capacity of
15 Mt of CO2 per year.
•  The Borneo project, which launches in FY2029 with JGC and JAPEX, will receive about half its CO2
from Japan. Malaysia is also negotiating agreements with Singapore and Japan for cross-border CO2
transport.
•  Petronas plans 20% of its total capital spending over the next five years to go to low-carbon
initiatives, including CCS. Yet, profitability remains uncertain due to high storage costs (estimated
at $60–120 per ton) compared to CO2 prices around $70 in Europe. Govt support will be essential
in the early stages.



MHI begins demo capturing CO2 from Himeji Power Station
(Nikkei, July 2)
•  MHI launched a demo plant that captures CO2 from gas turbine power generation.
•  Located at KEPCO’s Himeji No. 2 Power Station, the demo can capture 5 tons of CO2 per day with
over 95% separation efficiency and 99.9% purity.
•  Yet, a single gas turbine emits about 3,800 tons of CO2 daily. Thus, the demo is for testing
separation and capture, not for full-scale CO2 removal. The captured CO2 is mixed back into the
exhaust and returned to the power plant.
•  This plant is MHI’s fifth demo facility for CC, but only the second targeting natural gas, and the first
using a gas turbine. The company aims to reduce degradation caused by NOx and SOx in exhaust.
•  CONTEXT: One main challenge is that CO2 capture requires steam, reducing output of the steam

turbines used in gas turbine combined-cycle (GTCC) systems. CO2 capture can lead to a power reduction
of about 20–30%.

Hokkaido’s Tomari Unit 3 Strides Toward a Restart Despite Obstacles
After more than a decade of regulatory limbo, Hokkaido Electric is poised to tap back
into its nuclear power capacity. On April 30, the Nuclear Regulation Authority issued a
draft safety approval for Tomari NPP Unit 3, in effect greenlighting restart by 2027 – as
long as local consent can be secured. Meanwhile, safety reviews for Units 1 and 2 are
still pending.

In late spring, Tomari’s Unit 3 was one of three nuclear reactors selected under OCCTO’s
LTDA for decarbonization subsidies, which is another indication that a restart is close.
The other two were Tokai No. 2, which still faces safety reviews, and TEPCO’s
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 6 (see Japan NRG’s June 23 issue).
Of those three, Tomari Unit 3 has the best chances to get back online. Still, the path to
operation is anything but certain. The utility is grappling with financial difficulties,
regulatory obligations and, of course, political approval.

Just how soon could Tomari Unit 3 possibly turn back on? Japan NRG takes a look.

Need for nuclear
When it launched in late 2009, Tomari Unit 3 was Japan’s newest reactor. But it barely
functioned 1.5 years before it was shut down along with the country’s entire nuclear
power fleet in the wake of the March 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Over 11 years ago, Hokkaido Electric applied for restart, but its application has stalled
due to debates over whether a nearby underground fault line is active. Another issue is
the location of key facilities on land reclaimed from the sea. Local groups opposing a
restart say that a major quake could wreak havoc since these key facilities aren’t situated
on solid bedrock.
Hokkaido Electric insisted that the fault is not active, and eventually the NRA agreed,
giving the NPP a top mark for safety. Still, local opponents continue to argue against a
restart.

In the meantime, as the NPP remains idle, the utility has relied on LNG and coal
imports, leaving Hokkaido residents with some of Japan’s highest monthly bills.

| Kyushu Electric |  |  | 7,594 |  |  |

That cost disparity is a serious liability for Hokkaido’s ambitions to court energy-hungry,
high-tech industries such as the $36 billion Rapidus semiconductor plant. SoftBank also
plans to build a 1 GW data center in the region. Together, these projects could push
Hokkaido’s peak electricity demand up 50% by 2035.
The region, however, is rich in renewables and energy storage projects – in 2024, two of
Renova’s storage battery projects, for 90 MW and 50 MW, won OCCTO capacity
subsidies. But industry insiders argue that to keep the lights on at the mega projects
such as the Rapidus chip foundry and SoftBank’s data center, a consistent, dispatchable
power source is needed. When it comes to carbon-free baseload, that pretty much leaves
nuclear power.

Costs
Hokkaido Electric estimates that restarting Tomari Unit 3 could lower fuel costs, which
hit ¥174 billion in FY2024 alone. Should the NPP be brought back online, the utility
forecasts that nuclear power could account for as much as 40% of its electricity mix by
2030.
Yet, those ambitions require significant capital outlays. Safety upgrades for Tomari
include a new port, a seawall, and anti-terrorism infrastructure. Total bill: ¥515 billion.
Such work is part of the utility’s ¥1.29 trillion capital expenditure plan through FY2030.
As much as 70–80% of the planned spending will be related to nuclear infrastructure.

The costs, safety and other concerns, had some of Hokkaido Electric’s shareholders
calling for the company to wind up its nuclear facilities altogether. At the June 26
shareholders meeting, however, the utility confirmed that it will continue operating
NPPs.
What worries shareholders is the uncertainty of the financial return on all that
investment. Even with lower fuel bills, some investors question if the project will deliver
significant profit given the huge upfront costs, not to mention the nuclear sector’s
regulatory uncertainties. The risks are reflected in Hokkaido Electric’s balance sheet. In
FY2025, due to increased nuclear-related and labor expenditures, the utility expects
profits to fall 60% to ¥26 billion.

The port
Hokkaido Electric’s new port is a crucial part of its strategy. In early June, the utility
explained its plans for the facility to the prefectural governor. Located roughly 1.8
kilometers north of the NPP, the new port will be outside the Tomari site, thus
mitigating tsunami risk, especially from potentially drifting vessels. A secure road –
including tunnels and bridges – will connect the port and the plant. This will help ensure
safe transport of spent nuclear fuel.

Since it lies outside the NPP’s perimeters, port construction is not subject to NRA
approval. This should help avoid regulatory bottlenecks. Also, its construction will begin
only after the reactor restarts and take about four years.
Hokkaido Electric reassured regulators and authorities that the NPP can operate for
several years without new fuel shipments. In case of a delay to construction and a
subsequent halt of nuclear operations, existing power sources will suffice, thanks to
Ishikariwan Shinko Power Station Unit 2. The latter, powered by LNG, is scheduled to
start operations in FY2030.

Despite such efforts, the restart still hinges on local approval, which has become a sort
of ‘holy grail’ in Japan’s energy politics. Hokkaido Governor Suzuki called on the federal
government to clarify how local consent should be ascertained. Currently, it is
customary for nuclear projects to obtain the approval of their host community; however,
such a process is neither regulated nor standardized. The actual procedure of testing
citizens’ sentiment is open to interpretation. This leaves the issue as politically sensitive
and ambiguous.
In early June, Hokkaido Electric’s Tomari site director met with the mayor of Tomari
Village to present details of the port and road construction plan. Public consultations
and a final regulatory review, including input from METI, will be imperative before a
final go-ahead from local politicians.

Conclusion
A proactive stance by Hokkaido Electric to build new infrastructure for Tomari NPP, as
well as winning over the NRA, are good omens for a restart. But the ambiguity of local
consent procedures leaves the endeavor open to attack and delay, even if the opposition
is small. Local officials will fear public backlash without a clear guideline to follow and
point to in case of criticism.
This is where the disparity between a pro-nuclear national policy and the hands-off
approach to restarts by the national government become painfully evident. Local
authorities fear they have too much to lose and not enough to gain from blessing reactor
restarts.

Operating utilities are stuck in the middle, absorbing most of the financial damage
created by this indecisiveness and passing on a portion of the fallout to consumers via
electricity bills.

For now, the tech sectors that need the clean electricity that NPPs can provide are
supporting the nuclear revival – especially in countries like the U.S. But unless this
support extends to local stakeholder management, Big Tech is likely to grow frustrated
with the timelines and the fickle political and regulatory conditions of the nuclear
sector.
Japan’s pro-nuclear stakeholders – in government and industry – have a few years to
show that restarts can go ahead and become a predictable process. If they can’t, energy-
intensive users will simply switch to other options.

Energy Jobs in Japan: Fight to Retain Talent
With a common focus on identifying and attracting top talent, the importance of
retaining people is often overlooked. In the Japanese energy market competition for
talent is increasing, the types of hiring companies are diversifying and the opportunity
for high potential talent to significantly increase their market value with strategic moves
is higher than ever before.

Hiring companies need to consider and implement a clear retention strategy from the
start. This includes working style and benefits packages, longer term incentives designed
to increase retention, visibility for career growth and most critically, a healthy workplace
culture where employees feel valued and respected.
The market here is small, and people talk. In the past few months, we’ve seen multiple
cases of one or two key people leaving a toxic organization, and within a very short
period of time a mass exodus follows. When it comes to retention, prevention is better
than a cure.

The pull factor, temptation from the outside
Why do people pay north of a million JPY for a Rolex or Louis Vuitton bag? Is the
quality ten times better than a product that costs a hundred thousand JPY? Of course
not, however scarcity drives up prices. Various job functions within the energy industry
are either relatively new, or have an outsized impact on the success of an organization.
These are the main areas where we see talent scarcity driving up hiring prices:
• Offtake. Talent with a strong network of bankable offtakers beyond the obvious
GAFA players, and a track record of getting PPAs signed are in huge demand.
• Project origination. Japan is land-scarce for large scale projects. Talent who have
built a personal network of landowners and brokers have gained significant market
value.
• Interconnection. Both LTDA rounds were 10x oversubscribed for BESS applications.
That is a lot of grid connection applications being made. Talent who can do this
swiftly and efficiently commands a premium on the labor market.
• Trading. With futures volumes up 4x from last year and asset backed trading on the
rise, this talent is the new profit center for operators.
If you add in other skills, such as bilingual ability or engineering + commercial
negotiations, then scarcity increases. The bilingual electrical engineer who can also do
development and lead commercial negotiations has become a Patek Philippe.

As an employer, you can bet that your talent in such categories will be approached by
competitors. Even if they don’t have a LinkedIn profile and online presence, the market
is small enough that they will be approached by ex-colleagues, friends, or business
partners. Some of the approaches will include big money offers, significant promotion
opportunities or other major ‘pull factors’ that can tempt your otherwise happy talent
away.

Benefits, what do people want?
Covid-19 shook up the work place, and shifted priorities for many. Work-life balance
and flexibility have become a major factor for many employees, especially those with
young families. The increase in European companies entering Japan with generous leave
16

policies also creates a disparity that can sway decisions. Below are key benefits that
today’s talent cares about, which can keep people satisfied or see them walking out the
door:
• Hybrid workstyle. 3 days in the office, 2 days at home is the most desired setup for
employees in Japan now. 5 days in the office is increasingly rare, even for blue-chip
Japanese firms.
• Remote workstyle. Related to hybrids, many people moved back to their home
regions post Covid. A system that allows them to work from their hometown, and
payment for travel and/or accommodation close to HQ is highly desirable.
• Leave. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) mandates a minimum
of 10 days annual leave. Some companies still only offer this, where others are
offering 20 or 25 days, with additional leave for sick days, childcare leave etc.
• Housing support. Companies can adopt a couple of methods to offer full or partial
rental support; the benefit to the employee is that a portion of the cost is paid pre-
tax.
There are other benefits offered by some firms, such as wellness and education support,
additional health insurances, pension/ retirement systems; however, the above four
have the highest impact on talent attraction and retention.

Build a golden cage
The term ‘golden handcuffs’ typically refers to post-exit performance terms for top
management; however, a similar approach can be taken to keep employees engaged and
employed until the company reaches critical success milestones.

The simple approach of paying a higher base salary can work in some cases. After all,
Japanese talent tends to lean toward certainty and security, so they’ll favour higher base
salary (minimize downside risk) over high variable performance bonuses.
That being said, with scarcity pushing the value of ‘lightly experienced’ talent up, hiring
companies are often reluctant to pay top dollar for as yet unproven talent. Building up a
performance based ‘golden cage’ can be an ideal approach to minimize initial budget
outlay, but give strong incentive to high performers and increase retention. Here are
some long-term incentive methods that are particularly effective:

• RSU (Restricted Stock Units) or SO (Stock Options): RSU only applies to publicly
listed companies, and SO can be given for private firms. Typically, having a one year
cliff and three or four year period will give the company strong retention ability as
the employee has significant value tied up in staying. SO can be weaker as typically
illiquid, and RSU has the risk that a company trying to tempt your talent away may
opt to buy your RSU out in the form of a stock for stock sign-on bonus.
• Exit-linked profit share: Often seen in development platforms or investment
vehicles, a one-off bonus payout linked to events such as fund exit, asset selldown,
etc, can be a strong retention strategy. The key is visibility. When the timeline, or
the calculation for a split is vague, it often feels less real to employees and they’ll
walk away from this.
• Performance based profit share: Typically appearing in consulting/ advisory or
trading firms, giving a percentage of profit on an annual basis is an effective way to
reward your early joiners as the business grows. Risk is directly related to the
performance of your business; if it does well then they’re making too much money
to walk. But if the business suffers, so do the employees as vulnerabilities in the
scheme are exposed.
Not every scheme will apply to every type of business, however the feeling of reward
and recognition for contributions made is one of the strongest factors in talent retention.

Career growth - is it worth staying?
With competitors sniffing around your top talent, offering Director titles to your
Managers, giving wider responsibilities and attractive packages, how do you keep your
people from being tempted? Showing a clear future is critical. If someone is presented
with a certain step up externally, and the internal vision lacks clarity, or worse, if
internal promotion relies on simply taking more trips around the sun, you are sitting on
a ticking time bomb.
Companies that do this the best are open with their team with organization planning.
Employees can apply internally to open positions, and even if those openings have both
internal and external candidates being considered, the visibility and the chance to apply
are major retention factors.

For a loyal employee, working hard for years, suddenly having an external hire come in
above them can often be a trigger to start talking with people like us!
Not every company is large or complex enough to offer various career development
routes. Even if you are a small firm, what you can do is set clear KPIs and performance
targets that link to promotions in terms of title and income, even though the role and
responsibilities may remain largely unchanged. Avoiding a feeling of stagnation, and
fostering a sense of forward progress is critical for employee engagement.

Culture can make or break everything
Countless times, we’ve witnessed people leaving a lucrative golden cage, leaving a solid
benefits package on the table and stepping away from imminent promotions because the
culture simply sucked. Yelling bosses, no inter-team communication, shifting goalposts,
top-down management, expectation to put in the hours over generating results etc are
all signs of a bad culture.
Anytime someone leaves, or looks to leave, take the time to conduct an exit interview.
Not only with the employee, but also with their direct manager and upper
management.

Look for patterns if you have multiple exits. The old saying ‘people don’t leave jobs, they
leave managers’ is often very true.
