NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Kishida pledges unprecedented measures to ease power rate hikes
(Japan NRG, Oct. 3)
•  In a speech to the Diet, PM Kishida pledged “unprecedented” measures to ease the impact of
power rate hikes on households and businesses.
•  He wants to secure energy supply, accelerating renewables and energy conservation. Taking
advantage of a weak yen, he’ll encourage domestic semiconductor and storage battery output.
•  The measures include ways to curb inflation, one of the three key goals. The other two are wage

hikes, and investment and reforms for growth.
•  The prime minister also promised to tackle the nuclear issue head-on to strengthen energy
security, and also called for accelerating initiatives such as carbon pricing and the Asia Zero
Emission Fellowship before the end of this year.



Time needed before effects of economic package are felt: Nikkei
(Nikkei, Oct. 1)
•  PM Kishida announced a plan to offset rises in power bills.
•  Even if in place by year’s end, time is needed for impact.
•  METI plans measures to smooth spikes in electricity prices by spring.
•  METI says the cost of electricity might increase an additional 20-30% next year.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

LDP pledges to reverse rise in power costs
(Tokyo Shimbun, Oct. 2)
o  LDP policy chief Haguida Koichi says households now pay 20% more for electricity than
last year.
o  The govt must at least go halfway in reversing this trend, said Haguida.
o  If achieved, this would mean a ¥1,000 reduction in the average TEPCO subscriber’s

monthly power bill.


COP27 to focus on global goal to help developing economies
(Japan NRG, Oct. 4)
•  The main agenda for COP27 in Egypt next month includes hammering out specifics of the global
goal on adaptation (GGA), said Kanagawa-based Institute of Global Environmental Strategies

(IGES) that’s affiliated with the MoE.
•  Developing nations and Japan, the EU, U.S., Canada and Australia have conflicting views on GGA.
•  COP27’s host, Egypt, is expected to support developing nations hit by climate change, and to
help them secure food and water.
•  Japan promised an adaptation fund of $14.5 billion through 2025, from the govt and private
sectors.

METI to set up a decommissioning regulator
(Japan NRG, Oct. 5)
•  METI plans to set up a regulator dedicated to nuclear decommissioning that will manage
scrappage steps taken by power operators, to identify and resolve common issues, and oversee

decommissioning spending.
•  Among the possible candidates for this function are the Nuclear Reprocessing Organization of
Japan (NuRO), Nuclear Damage Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation Organization
(NDF), and Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO).
•  METI will narrow the roles of the new body, its governance, disclosure and other rules, and clarify
the roles of the govt and power operators.
• TAKEAWAY: Under present rules, power companies each accumulate their own funds for decommissioning,

which is estimated to cost ¥50 billion to ¥80 billion (from $350 million to $550 million) per reactor. The high
number of reactors set for decommissioning since the Fukushima accident, however, makes the task a
challenge for any single operator. A new regulator would act as a central body to collect funds and manage
the process. The government hopes that taking a national approach would help to smooth out the financial
and technical issues related to such a mass-scale decommissioning of facilities.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI seeks new law on max nuclear reactor lifespan
(Jiji, Oct. 6)
o  METI wants to extend the maximum service period for nuclear reactors beyond 60 years.

The present rule states that the basic lifespan is 40 years, but this can be extended to 60
years. However, as Japan faces a power crunch, METI aims to have more capacity
available by retaining the older reactors in service.
o  Among the 27 reactors that are still within their 40-year limit, only 10 have restarted.
o  CONTEXT: After the Fukushima disaster, Japan introduced stricter safety standards
limiting nuclear reactor operations to 40 years. But an additional 20 years is possible if
safety upgrades are made and a reactor passes screening by regulators.

• TAKEAWAY: A decision on reactor operating permit is likely by the year end, judging by comments from METI
minister Nishimura and earlier statements by Kishida.




METI launches study group on circular economy and resource recycling
(Japan NRG, Oct. 5)
•  METI launched the Study Group to Design Growth Oriented Circular and Self-Sufficient Economy,
which will meet seven times by March 2023.
•  The group comprises 12 members, from Seven & i, Panasonic, Asahi Kasei, Kao, PNB Paribas, IBM
Japan and other companies.
•  It will address increasing global demand for critical raw materials and how Japan could cope with

unexpected supply disruptions.
•  53% of industrial waste is recycled, and 17% non-industrial; so, there’s room for improvement.
• TAKEAWAY: With oversight for energy and natural resources, METI can trigger more dynamic action
compared to other ministries whose circular economy initiatives are limited to municipal levels and research.
The newly formed group represents sectoral leaders but doesn’t include the industrial waste recycling sector
that comprises small private businesses.

MoE to fund innovative carbon neutral projects
(Japan NRG, Oct. 6)
•  The MoE will fund research for aluminum dross waste recycling, zero emission greenhouses,
temperature difference power generation, use of chicken manure as energy, and more, as a part of

its Regional and Multi-Sectoral Carbon Neutrality Research and Development Program.
•  A panel will decide the amount of funding for each project.



Hydrogen energy: agreement to supply 90 million tons by 2030

(Japan NRG, Oct. 7)
•  The Hydrogen Energy Ministerial Meeting agreed on action to reach an annual production of 90
million tons of green and low-carbon footprint hydrogen in 2030.
•  The meeting on Sept 26 was attended by senior officials from 30 countries and organizations,
including 15 ministers.



Toyota logs 29 FCV sales in Sept

(Japan Automobile Dealers Association data, Oct. 6)
•  Toyota sold 29 fuel cell vehicles in September, an increase from 10 last month, according to the
Japan Automobile Dealers Association
•  JADA also reported sales of two imported FCV during the month, which could be Hyundai’s NEXO
model.
•  CONTEXT: Competing against Toyota’s Mirai was F-Cell by Mercedes, but this model was
available only on lease. NEXO could be Mirai’s first serious rival. Hyundai has a unique marketing

strategy, to sell NEXO online only.
• TAKEAWAY: Industry observers blame the lack of hydrogen service stations and the cost of hydrogen for the
limited appeal of FCVs. Some drivers also point to Mirai’s “untrendy” interior design, compared to the luxury
NEXO.



Mitsui & Co mulls Singapore methane venture
(Japan Maritime Daily, Oct. 6)
•  Mitsui & Co agreed with Denmark’s Maersk to perform a feasibility study to supply Singapore with
maritime methanol.
•  Supported by the Singapore Maritime Port Authority, the study will focus on the port’s logistical

and legal requirements for fueling and fuel storage.
•  Maritime methanol is seen as a green alternative to usual fuels.

•  The study runs until April 2024, and will look at logistics of establishing a CCS supply chain to
enable CO2 recovered in Japan and other countries to be shipped to Malaysia for injection into

underground reservoirs.



Mitsubishi Electric to start marketing of GHG-free vacuum circuit breaker
(Japan NRG, Oct. 5)
•  Mitsubishi Electric will start selling 72.5 kilovolt vacuum circuit breakers which do not use Sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6 gas), in North America. Instead of SF6 gas, the SF6 gas-free vacuum switchgear

uses vacuum valve for arc extinguishing.
•  California is now strengthening regulation for environment-unfriendly SF6 gas, and other states will
follow. Mitsubishi Electric will make SF6-free circuit breakers at their U.S. subsidiary in Pittsburgh.
• TAKEAWAY: SF6 is the most potent GHG. Because of its unique dielectric properties, utilities rely heavily on
SF6 in electric power systems for voltage electrical insulation and current interruption. Over a 100-year period,
SF6 has been 22,800 times more effective at trapping infrared radiation than CO2. Thus, a small amount of
SF6 can have a significant impact on climate change.




Toshiba to make highly efficient electrolysis electrodes for hydrogen production

(Company statement, Oct. 7)
•  Toshiba said it developed large-scale production technology for electrodes with high efficiency in
Power to Gas (P2G), while reducing iridium use to just 1/10th.
•  P2G uses electrolysis to convert renewable energy into hydrogen, for storage and transportation.
Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolysis is seen as a highly promising method, since it
reacts quickly to power fluctuations and is highly durable. However, PEM uses iridium, one of the
rarest of all metals, as the catalyst in electrodes.
•  Toshiba is aiming for commercialization in FY2023.

NEWS:     POWER       MARKETS






More power retailers go bankrupt or exit the business
(Denki Shimbun, Oct. 6)
•  On Sept 21, FPS said it will exit the low voltage power retail business. FPS, a part of the GLP
Group, took over the service from bankrupt F-Power in April and continued to supply electricity.
Now, it will only provide power retail for high voltage and extra high voltage businesses.
•  On Sept 4, Shizen Energy reported exiting the power retail business. At that time, Ishikawa Electric

also began bankruptcy proceedings.
•  To date, six PPSs have declared bankruptcy (Hope Energy, Infini, Gujo Energy, IS Energy, FT
Energy and Ishikawa Electric), and many others, such as Lpio or West Electric Power, got out of the
electricity retail business.
• TAKEAWAY: More than 10% of all PPS (power producer and supplier) had either stopped working in the
electricity retail market as of June this year, either due to exiting the business or bankruptcy, according to the

latest Teikoku Databank survey.
• In the past, without any warning some PPSs announced stopping power supply, leaving customers in the lurch.
While the majority of PPS have conducted business in a proper manner, such incidents have dented the
reputation of independent power suppliers in the market. Also, METI has been critical of companies that

exited the sector in a disorderly manner and may look to tighten the rules around retail licenses going forward.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI to study ways to disclose power retailers’ dependency on spot supply

(Japan NRG, Oct. 4)
o  METI will study ways to disclose power retailer dependency on spot supply sources, to
improve visibility of near-term fuel requirements of power operators.
o  Reducing uncertainties allows adequate fuel procurement.
o  Data will be processed to conceal sensitive details.
o  METI will also study how fragmented power markets – spot, futures, and forward delivery
– can complement the other and the bi-party term contracts.




METI plans to revise offshore wind tenders still hotly debated despite public survey
(New Energy Business News, Oct. 3)
•  METI carried out a survey of market participants to ask for feedback on the current system for
offshore wind power capacity auctions. The results are in, and based on the more than 1,000

responses from 151 parties, the ministry plans to revise its plans for the auctions.
•  The survey showed that most respondents were concerned about the scoring system and points
allocation, while the second most pressing issue was the speed at which public bids are evaluated.
•  The ministry’s expert panel is deciding between at least three proposals to speed up the rollout of
offshore wind capacity. These include offering a decreasing number of points in the evaluation for

bidders who offer later start of operations and setting a base date according to which the different
bids would be graded.
•  There are also strong debates among experts on whether to limit or not the number of auctions
that a bidder can participate in.
•  Another area under examination is whether the use of base ports overlap between different

projects and sea areas. Most experts also want the number of base ports to increase.
•  Further, there is no agreement among experts on whether to set a base price.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The construction of Shimane NPP Unit 3 was almost finished in 2011, but then the Fukushima
disaster hit and the facility was idled.
•  The NRA began a review of Shimane Unit 3 on Sept 29 for the first time in 4.5 years. Chugoku
Electric is confident that a restart is possible soon.
• TAKEAWAY: Shimane Unit 3 is a large reactor with 1,373 MW of capacity. It’s been more than 10 years since it

generated electricity. Unit 1 (460 MW) shut for decommissioning in April 2015, so only Unit 2 (820 MW) is
available. The cost of maintaining equipment for many years without any revenue is such that a restart decision
is likely sooner rather than later.




Tohoku Electric considers building new nuclear reactors
(Tohoku Broadcasting, Oct. 1)
•  Higuchi Kojiro, president of Tohoku Electric, wants his company to be involved in the development
of a new nuclear reactor.
•  First, the restart of existing reactors is needed and then construction of new units could come from

the 2030s, he said.
•  He said that nuclear technology is needed to maintain the stable supply of electricity, and to
achieve carbon neutrality.
• TAKEAWAY: Tohoku Electric operates three nuclear reactors at Onagawa NPP (Miyagi Prefecture) and one at
Higashi-dori NPP, but none have restarted. At the Higashi-dori site, installation of four units was planned (two
for Tohoku Electric, and two more for TEPCO) but only Tohoku’s unit 1 began operation.

• All Tohoku Electric’s stations deploy BWR, the same family of reactor technologies as at the Fukushima NPP.



Chubu Electric affiliate starts operation of first geothermal power plant
(Nikkei, Oct. 6)
•  In December, Chubu Electric will begin operating its first geothermal power plant in the Okuhida
hot spring village in Takayama, Gifu Prefecture. It is rare for the locals to agree to the construction
of a geothermal facility due to fears of impact on hot springs. Chubu Electric has ensured the

project will be beneficial to both parties, and will supply hot spring water free of charge to the
local inns.
•  This may be Japan’s first case for “coexistence” in a hot spring area.
•  The plant will be operated by a new company, Nakao Geothermal Power. Chubu Electric will own
45% and Toshiba Energy Systems 55%.
•  The plant will start operation on Dec 1. With an output of approximately 2 MW, it can supply
power to approximately 4,000 households.

Japan’s Fusion Future – Significant Progress but Many Years Away
As nuclear power returns to the good graces of corporate and political leaders in
Japan and the U.S., nuclear fusion is gaining more attention as a potential carbon-free
energy source.

The fusion energy projects appearing in recent years remain experimental, but there’s
hope within the industry that a major breakthrough could happen within the decade.
While nuclear power requires splitting atoms, nuclear fusion requires their
combination, the same process by which the sun produces energy when hydrogen
atoms fuse to become helium.

Thanks to advances in AI and electronics, nuclear fusion is no longer a physics
problem but more of an engineering one. Thus, large sums of money are being
invested. North America is leading the charge to develop fusion power, but Japan’s
engineering companies are determined to be a part of this revolution.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Kishida mentioned nuclear fusion as part of his clean
energy strategy, which allows startups in the field to claim state financial support.
Then, on Sept. 13, Sanae Takaichi, the Minister of Economic Security, said the
government will soon formulate a detailed strategy to develop nuclear fusion power.


Technical challenges
Soviet scientists pioneered nuclear fusion 70 years ago, creating the tokamak,
considered by many as the leading device for a fusion reactor. To quote from a U.S.
Department of Energy text: “A tokamak is a machine that confines a plasma using
magnetic fields in a donut shape that scientists call a torus.”

Fusion energy centers on a reaction fueled by hydrogen isotopes — deuterium and
tritium — that produce about 4x times the energy per unit mass of a standard uranium
nuclear fission reaction. In December 2021, a tokamak in the U.K. set a record for
fusion power. The Joint European Torus (JET) produced 59 megajoules of energy,
double the record it set in 1997.

Private companies, however, are researching new technologies to build smaller,
cheaper and often simpler fusion devices.

"Some key challenges are tritium breeding and handling, and materials,” said Dr.
Melanie Windridge, CEO of Fusion Energy Insights. “Tritium is one of the fuels for
most approaches, but not all. It doesn’t exist naturally so needs to be made in the
fusion device. The challenge is that fusion machine environments are very hostile and
damaging to materials; commercial devices will need to run for a long time, so better
and stronger materials are required, particularly to shield components against
neutrons that are produced.”

To achieve fusion the fuel must be heated to tens of millions of degrees Celsius and
then confined in a state of plasma, which is the hard part. Poor confinement means
heat leaks out. In the end, you want to get more energy out than was put in, which is

18

where everyone has failed so far. And, which is what scientists are still striving to
achieve.


North America races ahead
According to the Fusion Industry Association in Washington D.C., about 30
companies are working on nuclear fusion, and some hope to have a commercially-
viable and functional fusion reactor in the 2030s.

Toward that goal, in 2021 about $3.4 billion was invested into nuclear fusion R&D.
One of the leaders is Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which raised $1.8 billion and is
backed by Bill Gates and Google. CFS hopes to have a fusion energy prototype in
2025 and thinks it can produce electricity for the grid by the end of the 2030s.

“The plasma needs to make more energy than it took to create it; the system needs to
generate more electricity than it takes to operate it; and a power plant based on the
technology needs to be able to operate at a profit,” said Ryan Umstattd, vice-
president at Zap Energy, summing up the challenge.

Vancouver-based General Fusion received $130 million from billionaire Jeff Bezos and
hedge fund Segra Capital Management. Seattle-based Helion Energy raised $500
million from tech investor Sam Altman and others. Zap Energy, which includes Shell as
an investor, aims to build a nuclear fusion plant in the 2030s -- each power module a
few square meters and designed at 50 MW of capacity.

In California, TAE Technologies has raised $1.2 billion since 1998 and $250 million in
a round this summer led by Google, Sumitomo Corp of Americas, and Chevron’s VC
division. TAE aims to build commercial scale fusion reactors in the Asia-Pacific region
in the 2030s. TAE also partners with Japan’s National Institute for Fusion Science.


Japanese startups join the fray
For 37 years Japan’s nuclear fusion program has centered around JT60 and its
successor, the JT60SA, (short for Japan Torus-60). This magnetic fusion program is run
by the Naka Fusion Institute of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA).

The NFI is a partner in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in
France that includes nearly 30 countries. Slated for a 2025 completion, ITER will cost
about $22 billion and be the world's largest magnetic confinement plasma experiment
and tokamak fusion reactor.

In the past few years, however, Japan’s private sector has been more active. One of
its most exciting innovations is the “helical magnetic confinement” to stably confine
high-temperature plasmas developed by Tokyo-based startup Helical Fusion. The firm
was founded in October 2021 with backing from Sony, as well as Naruke Makoto, ex-
president of Microsoft Japan. Among its top officials are scientists from the National
Institute of Fusion Science.

Helical Fusion co-founder and CEO Takaya Taguchi says the helical method’s
advantage is long-term operation. The tokamak has a plasma duration of 1,000
seconds, while the Large Helical Device has demonstrated over 3,000 seconds and
achieved 100 mln ºC, so the plasma quality is very high. Helical Fusion plans to realize

19

a commercially-viable fusion reactor by 2040 for electricity supply to factories or small
islands, but not for the grid.

Another local leader is Kyoto Fusioneering, founded in 2019. To date, KF has raised
¥1.7 billion from investors including DBJ Capital, Kyoto University Innovation Capital,
and JIC Venture Growth Investments.

KF partners with the UK’s Atomic Energy Authority, recently joining its STEP Program
to design and build a commercial scale prototype fusion plant by 2040. KF is
responsible for the conceptual design of in-vessel components.

At the end of March, Japan's first laser nuclear fusion company, EX-Fusion raised ¥130
million in a pre-seed round led by ANRI, a Tokyo-based VC firm, along with Osaka
University Venture Capital, to develop fusion reactor components. EX-Fusion seeks to
commercialize laser-powered nuclear fusion reactors.

With this process, energy is obtained by using a high-power laser to compress a
mixture of deuterium and tritium to high density and heat it to high temperature,
causing nuclear fusion. EX-Fusion founder Kazuki Matsuo is the world record holder
for fast ignition type of reaction.

In addition to startups, major corporations are also getting involved. In July,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries delivered equipment to the Rokkasho Fusion Institute to
demonstrate the safety of the ‘blanket’ that’s a component in the reactor’s inner wall
and extracts the heat generated. It will be used as Japan’s Test Blanket Module for
ITER.

While it’s hard for both scientists and outside observers to discern which fusion energy
technology will eventually succeed – if any – the nuclear fusion landscape is a wide
open field with many exciting innovations appearing every year. Many surprises are in
store, possibly from researchers unknown as of today and working outside of the main
scientific and startup ecosystem.

“The Tom Edison and Nikola Tesla types are the wild cards,” said fusion inventor John
T. Sullivan, CEO and founder of Marjo Engineering in the U.S.

As some scientists quip — nuclear fusion reactors are still many years away, but it’s
important that we keep an ion them. More power to them.

Great Miscalculations:
The Impact of ANRE’s Error in Available Thermal Capacity


On Sept 15, the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy reported that its data on
available thermal power capacity this decade was way-off. The agency had
underestimated the total capacity scheduled to shut down by 2030, and overcounted
the new capacity planned to come online.

The errors amount to 16.52 GW of thermal capacity that won’t be available by 2030,
which is equivalent to 16 nuclear reactors. What’s more, the admission was made a
week before state auctions for power capacity in 2026.

The extent of the error, and its timing, raised questions. Was this announcement
intended to influence markets and policies, or purely a human error?

Industry observers say the miscalculation won’t have an immediate impact on markets,
but will push METI and ANRE to take bold action to rectify the massive capacity gap.
This could be done by slowing the decommissioning of aging thermal capacity, a
process made easier by a recent regulatory change.

Another option is that METI could speed up the rollout of its co-firing agenda,
pushing more coal and gas-fired plants to also burn hydrogen or ammonia.

Both options, however, have drawbacks.


ANRE’s mistake
On March 25, 2021, ANRE reported to a sub-panel on basic power and gas policies
that in 2016-2020 Japan lost 1.02 GW of thermal power derived from facilities that
burn oil, LNG and coal, and was projected to lose another 4.41 GW over 2021-2025
and 8.81 GW over 2026-2030.

During 2016-2020, 15.53 GW of new capacity came online, while 16.55 GW was idled
permanently, resulting in a 1.02 GW net loss. On Sept 15, however, ANRE corrected
those figures: Japan lost 1.74 GW in 2016-2020, as was now expected to lose 17.8
GW in 2021-2025, and another 11.22 GW in 2026-2030.

The data errors occurred when the grids were changing their plant shutdown
schedules. Generation capacity that was initially taken offline for a short period, but
later categorized as requiring permanent closure, was not counted. Errors were made
when determining the time of decommissioning of old capacities, ANRE explained.

One power market analyst believes the debacle is purely the result of a human error
that came about simply because a second pair of eyes were not ordered to check the
figures.

2026-2030       11.22 (8.81)
13.60 (8.81)
No impact on capacity auction
There is a similar brush off of the mistake by operators taking part in capacity auctions
- one of the subsets of the Japanese power market.

Power capacity auctions for 2026 started on Sept 20 and closed on Oct 4, only one
business day after the error was announced. Sept 19 was a public holiday. During the
auction, the participants were required to file their available capacities for April 2026 -
March 2027.

Power operators and observers said the ANRE figures would have a negligible impact
as auction participants don’t use that data to build market scenarios.

While ANRE’s figures are nationwide totals, capacity auctions are broken down into
nine geographical areas. ANRE collects and makes forecasts for installed capacities of
major regional grids, while the auctions are for basic capacities in operation.

Power operators report their business plans, including anticipated capacities in
operation, to the Organization for Cross-Coordination of Transmission Operators
(OCCTO). So, auction participants use OCCTO’s data.

As an example: ANRE undercounted the country’s installed thermal capacity by 2.41
GW for 2026-2030, but this didn’t trigger changes in the figures the operators had
reported to OCCTO.

One auction participant said her company was not at all affected by changes in the
ANRE figures. Changes in current market conditions are too significant, making the
error issue negligible, she said.


Where to expect impact
Several sources said the main concern was how METI policies will now change in order
to make up for the miscounting. They anticipate difficulties in decommissioning
thermal power plants, especially if the decisions were for economic and not
technological reasons.

METI has some leeway in this since a recent regulatory change gives the ministry
power to screen all power facilities’ decommissioning plans.

|  |  |  | 13.60 (8.81) |  |

Bureaucrats could also ask utilities to accelerate plans to install new capacities.

The most likely scenario, however, is that METI will seek to speed up the rollout of co-
firing of hydrogen/ ammonia at thermal plants. Co-firing could become a way to
legitimize thermal expansion, some experts remarked. Co-firing technologies are still
in their infancy, however.


Speed up co-firing
Japanese utilities have plans to introduce hydrogen/ ammonia co-firing as the
government has mandated it to represent 1% of total national power generation by
2030. The various projects, however, are progressing at different speeds.

Chugoku Electric was the first to conduct a trial run of ammonia/ coal co-firing at its
Mizushima plant in 2017. The company is now exploring other venues after making
the decision to scrap the plant in 2023.

JERA plans trial runs of ammonia-coal co-firing at the Hekinan No. 4 station in 2023.
Kansai Electric plans to launch a hydrogen-LNG co-firing trial at its Himeji plant in
2025 and commercialize operations in 2030.

Others have stated their co-firing ambitions as a part of a long-term strategy to be
carbon neutral but haven’t elaborated.

Grid           Co-firing type  Plant           Schedule
Hokkaido Electric Ammonia/ coal Tomato Atsuma  NA

JERA           Ammonia/ coal   Hikinan No. 4   Trial from 2023
Tohoku Electric NA             NA              Trial from 2024

Kansai Electric LNG/ hydrogen  Himeji No. 1, No. 2 Trial from 2025
Mizushima No. 2 (to be
Chugoku Electric Ammonia/ coal                 NA
scrapped in 2023)

As the government becomes more involved in speeding up co-firing initiatives, state
planners need to set up day to day policy making for the sector, Kansai Electric told a
METI hydrogen panel recently. In order to reduce the cost of hydrogen power
generation to the current level of gas-fired capacity, it’s necessary to reduce the
former’s running costs, as well as the expenses from gas conversion, storage, and land
and marine transportation.

To achieve the above, KEPCO urged closer coordination among the three relevant
policymaking departments in METI: the one responsible for decarbonized capacity
auction systems; one dealing with hydrogen imports and storage bases; and another
charged with establishing global supply chains.

A KEPCO spokeswoman clarified to Japan NRG that if the three divisions do not
synchronize well, then power operators will suffer financially as the overall cost of
hydrogen/LNG co-firing will not decrease.

New data mechanism needed
As part of efforts to prevent these errors from happening again, ANRE plans to
establish a new mechanism so that the data will run through multiple layers of checks
before publication and will be managed digitally as much as possible.

Following recent amendments to the Electricity Business Act, power operators will
also be required to consult with the government regarding any thermal capacity
decommissioning plans, and this system should allow more accurate future capacity
forecasting.

The data error incident will have a ripple effect beyond ANRE’s internal working. The
agency claims that the error has not caused any changes in its decisions or altered the
outlook that Japan will lose thermal capacities over the coming years and needs to
secure replacements. The incident only endorses its long-standing view that the loss
of thermal capacities will have a critical impact on the nation’s energy supply.

In the end, other METI or ANRE departments may get involved in the search for
additional power capacity that could be available this decade. This likely opens the
door to greater attention on renewables and nuclear.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Coal and renewable energy
Queensland, One of Australia's top coal-producing states, plans to source 70% of its
energy from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035; its previous target was 50% by
2030. Also, coal-fired power plants will be converted to renewable hubs by 2035 as part
of a A$62 billion ($40 billion) clean energy plan.

Brazil/ Wind power
Vestas will equip South America’s largest wind farm – Engie’s 846 MW Serra de Assuruá
project in Bahia. It will use 120 Vestas V150-4.5MWs. Engie has an option to buy another
68 by year’s end. The wind farm will come online in late 2024.

China/ Battery storage
China switched on the world's largest flow battery, a 100-MW, 400-MWh vanadium
flow battery installed in Dailan that offers low-cost energy storage without using
lithium. China plans that compressed air energy storage (CAES) will handle nearly a
quarter of all its energy storage by 2030.

Europe/ Energy crisis
Two EU commissioners said Germany’s energy relief package “raised questions” and
it’s necessary to avoid a race for subsidies. Germany is under fire since it announced a
“protective shield” for businesses and consumers struggling with soaring energy costs.

Europe/ Wind power
Siemens Gamesa will cut 3,000 jobs, mostly in Europe; and almost half in Denmark and
Germany. Soon, more cuts will be made elsewhere in global operations. Siemens
Gamesa employs 27,000 worldwide

France/ Hydrogen energy
Electrolyser makers McPhy, Genvia, Elogen and John Cockerill will build gigafactories
as part of a €2.1 billion state program to make France a world leader in hydrogen energy.
Recipients will also invest a total of €3.2 billion of private money.

OPEC/ Oil production cut
Russia and OPEC approved production cuts of 2 mln barrels/ day, infuriating the White
House before important midterm elections in November. Oil prices are now around $90
a barrel, down from $120 in early June.

Poland/ Natural gas
The 900-km Baltic Pipe project began sending gas to Poland from Norway via Denmark.
A JV of Denmark’s Energinet and Poland's GAZ-SYSTEM, the pipeline has capacity to
transport 10 bcm of gas a year to Poland.

U.S./ LNG exports
The White House won’t curb natural gas exports as part of plans to alleviate the EU’s
energy gas shortages. A total of 87 LNG cargoes departed from U.S. ports last month,
carrying 6.3 m/t of LNG, slightly more than the 6.25 m/t in August.

U.S./ Renewable energy
Brookfield Renewable will acquire Scout Clean Energy for $1 billion and possibly invest
$350 million. Scout owns over 1,200 MW of operating wind assets, and a pipeline of
over 22,000 MW of wind, solar and storage projects across 24 states.

U.S./ Wind power
Dominion Energy may exit an offshore wind project if the state’s performance guarantee
remains. The planned $9.8 billion wind farm off the coast of Virginia would be the state’s
largest energy project and the largest wind project in the U.S.
