NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Japan looks set to shelve plans for a carbon tax
(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 8)
•  Govt hoped to include a carbon emissions tax into FY2023 tax reform, but has put the move on
hold due to the difficult economic climate.
This puts the onus to raise funds for decarbonization on instruments like a surcharge in the
electricity bill and the issue of green bonds. PM Kishida’s govt wants to launch its own version of a

green debt program called Green Transformation (GX) bonds.
•  Details of the GX bond issuance will be hammered out by the end of this year, Finance Ministry
Suzuki said. The govt needs to submit a bill related to GX bonds to parliament in January.



Japan, U.S. and other rich nations to offer Indonesia $20 bn to move away from coal

(Bloomberg, Nov. 11)
•  Details to be published at the G20 meeting in Bali this week after Biden-Widodo talks. An
Indonesian minister confirmed that the deal will be worth at least $15 bn.
•  The money will via the Just Energy Transition Partnership, the program created last year to deliver
similar aid to South Africa. The idea is to help finance Indonesia’s actions to close excess fossil fuel
generation capacity and limit future coal-fired projects. This is seen as important to support the
development of renewable energy in the country.
•  CONTEXT: Indonesian officials have previously mentioned the figure of $600 bn as necessary to

phase out all coal generation and transition to renewables capacity.



ANRE proposes rule changes to resolve community conflicts with renewables operators
(Japan NRG, Nov. 10)
•  ANRE proposed changes in regulations to the working group on community conflicts. It includes

requirements related to the approval to obtain property, communication with the community, and
the liability of project owners.
•  Since obtaining all property and development approvals before applying for a power business
license is not realistic, ANRE suggested narrowing the necessary approvals to those in the forestry,
housing and disaster prevention fields.
•  Meetings with residents will be required for plants of over 50 kW in capacity, and the govt won’t
allow the resale of renewable projects that don’t comply with the rules.
•  The liability of project owners and the outsourcing of tasks to third-party contractors will be clearly

written in regulations.
•  CONTEXT: The proposal followed the working group’s interviews with solar, wind, geothermal,
hydro and biomass power operators on Oct 25.

• TAKEAWAY: ANRE and panel members stressed the need to be strict in granting operational permits in the
absence of certain regulatory approvals, because damages to the environment after the start of construction
are difficult to recover. Currently, operators must file a statement that says they plan to obtain relevant
approvals. The most effective sanction is possibly a refusal by grid companies to connect those project
operators that have a conflict with the local community.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Opposition to solar farms grows over safety fears
(Kobe Shimbun, Nov. 7)
o  A new solar development on a steep hill overlooking a residential area in Himeji is
drawing the ire of locals. They’re worried the panels, some of which are only 10 meters

from houses, could slide in the event of heavy rains.
o  In 2020, plans to build a 9.2 ha solar farm in nearby Takarazuka were shelved after 4,000
residents signed a petition in opposition.
o  According to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Tokyo, over 160 cases of
local opposition to solar developments were recorded by end 2021.




METI ponders three options for nuclear reactor lifetime extension
(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 9)
•  The Nuclear Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy hosted a
meeting to discuss life extension of nuclear reactors.
•  METI reviewed three options:
•  1) maintain the status quo (40 years, with one extension for a max of 20 years based on NRA

approval).
•  2) a 30-year operational life followed by 10-year extensions, based on site and equipment
inspections every decade. There’s no limit to reactor lifespan.
•  3) use option 1, but discount the years spent idle due to the Fukushima disaster. For example, a
facility such as Kyushu Electric’s Sendai NPP, which was only offline for about four years after the
Fukushima accident, would see its operating life capped at 64 years.
•  METI will decide the issue by the end of 2022.
• TAKEAWAY: Readers may recall that a Sankei newspaper item about a week ago had announced that Option

2 of the above was already decided on by the NRA, the industry regulator. Technically, the regulator is
independent of METI and reports directly to the Cabinet Office. But it does need to work in tandem with
METI, and the ministry is after all the final decision maker in terms of policy.
For now, METI is laying out the various options and waiting for feedback. The ministry used the meeting to
reference other countries’ experience in the field, pitching the UK’s model (no final limit, but a review every 10
years) against the U.S. example (a finite life span split between an initial license and extensions).

The ministry could go with Option 2, but may decide that strategically Option 3 is better. The latter allows
METI to avoid being accused of diluting rules for an industry that still splits the public mood. It also makes it
more likely that new reactors will be built – if only to replace aged units. That’s important from the govt’s point
of view since construction of new nuclear facilities can stimulate a broader industry revival. Both METI and PM

Kishida’s office will be monitoring public opinions very carefully on this issue before announcing the final
decision.

METI to support component suppliers instead of reactor suppliers
(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 11)
•  Instead of helping BWR / PWR reactor suppliers, METI’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy
(ANRE) will support component manufacturers for innovative reactors such as SMRs or HTTRs.
•  Groups will be set up with companies and research institutes according to reactor type, and an

international marketing campaign will support Japanese-made components.
•  This is a major shift from METI’s policy to date which centered on supporting the top nuclear plant
suppliers such as Toshiba, Hitachi, and MHI. Component makers that stand to benefit include IHI
and JGC.
• TAKEAWAY: For the first time since the Fukushima disaster, Japan has updated its nuclear policy to include
building new NPPs and developing innovative reactors. But it will take a long time to start construction of new

NPPs. In the meantime, this policy is one way to keep up with international competitors of innovative reactors.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JGC and Cosmo set up a new firm to produce Japan’s first domestic SAF line
(Company Statement, Nov. 8)
o  JGC Holdings, Cosmo Oil, and Revo International established a new company, Saffaire

Sky Energy, to oversee the first domestic large-scale production of SAF (sustainable
aviation fuel). The venture aims to supply approximately 30,000 kiloliters of SAF annually
from 100% waste cooking oil in Japan.
o  Construction of the SAF production facility is due to begin in the summer of 2023 at
Cosmo Oil's Sakai Refinery (Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture), with completion seen by the
end of 2024. Commercial operations will begin in the second half of 2024 or early 2025.

Japan looks to Thailand for bioethanol that doesn't fuel food insecurity
(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 4)
•  Sumitomo Corp. trading house will back an ethanol project in Thailand that claims it will be the first
in Asia not to impact food stocks.

Sumitomo is working with Global Green Chemicals, a subsidiary of Thai petrochemical group PTT
Global Chemical. The two wish to engage in commercial production of bioethanol made from
bagasse, which is left over after sugarcane is crushed for its juice.
•  CONTEXT: Bioethanol is seen as a potential additive or even alternative to petroleum products for
automobile fuel and aviation fuels. It can also be used as a raw material to manufacture plastic.
Critics, however, say land used to grow crops for fuel eats into farmland available for food
production.
•  Sumitomo's Thai plant is expected to be built by 2025. Production volumes are not yet decided.

Govt to promote heat-insulating glass windows
(Japan NRG, Nov. 8)
•  The MoE, METI and MILT will promote use of heat-insulating window glass in homes to achieve
70% residential carbon reductions by 2030.

•  70% of Japanese homes do not have heat insulating windows.
•  The govt plans to subsidize up to half of the costs needed to replace windows.
• TAKEAWAY: Low carbon houses need to find a balance with other housing requirements such as measures to
protect against earthquakes, floods, typhoons and moisture endurance. Heat-insulating windows are heavy
and if installed on the second floor could might cause issues for the bottom floor, such as making it difficult to
open doors.

Law amendments delaying plant shutdowns take effect
(Japan NRG, Nov. 7)
•  Power operators will have to consult METI before making decisions on the decommissioning of
power capacities; this is effective Nov 14, and follows amendments to the Electricity Business Act
earlier this year.
•  Operators will inform METI at least nine months before a planned decommissioning.

•  Also effective Nov. 14, the scope of JOGMEC will expand to cover CCS, hydrogen, ammonia,
geophysical surveys for offshore wind projects, and it will make investments into domestic rare
metal projects, as well as those overseas.
•  CONTEXT: Previously, power operators did not need METI authorization to close old plants. The
new system aims to slow the dismantling of thermal power plants. Around 30 GW of such capacity
will be taken offline, while 12 GW of new capacities will be brought online from 2021 to 2025,

resulting in a net loss of 18 GW of thermal capacity.
• TAKEAWAY: ANRE pointed out the need to help operators retain thermal plant staff and fuel procurement
channels, in addition to the revised regulatory framework to slow decommissioning.




METI tightens regulations on FIT for renewables with output over 50 kW
(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 10)
•  The working group for sustainable energy use and coexistence with communities, which is under
the auspices of METI’s Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy, presented a plan to
strengthen regulations for new renewable energy sites that have more than 50 kW capacity.
•  Under FIT law, renewables developers are “expected to make an effort” to explain their project to

the community. However, as tensions between developers and communities increase, METI seeks
tougher limits on new FIT projects.
•  Rooftop solar panels and installations less than 10 kW are not required to engage with the
community. But those with more than 10 kW but less than 50 kW have to publicize their activity,
other than hosting explanatory meetings.




Offshore wind areas to switch from FIT to FIP tariff system
(New Energy Business News, Nov. 8)
•  Public bids for the sea areas off Happo Town and Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture, were suspended
in March due to changes in the offshore wind public bidding system. Under the previous schedule,
it was assumed that FIT certification would be obtained in FY2023 and transition to the FIP system

would be made in FY2024. Now, with public solicitation suspended, it is decided that the switch
will be made directly to FIP.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  A written survey was conducted on the status of participation in the public offering under the FIP
system among the 9 companies that applied for information in the area. Of those, fours said they
plan to participate and three said they would not. Some firms voiced concerns about the FIP
system. Despite this, officials intend to allow only the FIP system.
•  In setting the upper supply price limit, the IRR will be set at 10%, the same as in the first public

offering.

ANALYSIS

BY CHRISTOPHER ROMANS
FOUNDER
JUPITER ADVISORS
New Opportunities in Japan’s Emerging Carbon Credit Markets

In late September, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) launched a trial run of Japan’s first
nationwide carbon credit trading system. The mechanism, based around voluntary
credits, is still quite new and trying to find the right balance between stringent
application and optimal terms that will attract a wide swathe of corporates in Japan.

Even at this stage, however, one thing seems clear. The start of carbon trading in
Japan will open up a number of opportunities for overseas companies.

As the world’s No. 3 economy, with a strong manufacturing base and deep pockets,
Japan offers a highly attractive market. Unlike most of the 100-plus nations that
announced net-zero pledges and ambitious targets to reduce emissions, Japan baked
its commitments into law. Domestic companies are also major players in western tech
supply chains and conscious of the stringent climate targets that they’ll need to adopt
to retain their positions.

Currently, the potential to generate carbon credits in Japan is limited; a domestic-only
focus for credits would make the TSE market too expensive and illiquid. This is why
the government has signaled that over time carbon credits forged overseas must play
a significant role on the TSE trading platform.

Should foreign companies and project developers be optimistic about accessing the
Japanese market to sell their credits? In my view, the answer is yes, and the situation
will only get better in time.


Background
The trial phase of the TSE’s carbon trading platform is due to run until February 2023.
The creation of this system is heavily supported by METI and is one of the core tenets
of Prime Minister Kishida’s GX (Green Transformation) decarbonization vision.

Over 100 companies have agreed to participate in the trial, with over four times that
number involved in the broader conversation around carbon trading market rules and
practicalities. This pilot process is dubbed by METI officials as the GX League.

Bureaucrats hope that by keeping the trading voluntary and allowing the rulemaking
discussions to be led by corporates and civil society, the outcome will be acceptable
to private companies, which have traditionally rejected carbon credits as a burden on
their business.

If the pilot project wins a sufficient response, then a full carbon credit trading system
may launch in April 2023.


Reasons for optimism
This situation is positive not only for Japan but also for businesses outside the country

16


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

that could offer carbon credits in Tokyo. There are three key reasons to believe this
will happen.

1)Many leading technology firms insist on decarbonizing supply chains. Apple is
perhaps the most aggressive, with a commitment to carbon neutrality in its supply
chain by 2030. Many of Apple’s components are made in Japan and those producers
will have to demonstrate compliance. Apple is not alone, though. Other tech titans
such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook are similarly committed to squeezing CO2
out of their respective supply chains.

2)Next, there’s an increase in the imposition of carbon border adjustments by major
economies. The largest so far is the European Union, which is implementing a
mechanism that will likely take effect in 2026. Canada is studying such a mechanism
and the U.S. considered it briefly as part of a larger tax code reform. The EU plan
probably won’t be realized without other major economies implementing such
mechanisms.

3)Japan’s voluntary carbon market won’t stay voluntary forever. The government, as a
matter of policy, tends not to rush head first into policy shifts that have major
implications for the economy. Rather, it prefers a slow and methodical approach, such
as the introduction of a voluntary plan. A similar approach was taken with corporate
governance reforms.

With the carbon trial for the TSE, METI seeks to understand that this mechanism really
works, that companies want to use it, and that it’s effective before a mandated
economy-wide rollout is given the green light.


Details to consider
Given this outlook, what considerations should foreign companies and project
developers think about when looking at selling their offsets in Japan? Three key points
can be helpful.

First, know the methodology. Currently, credits sold on the TSE conform to
methodologies outlined in the domestic J-Credit system, which is Japan’s oldest local
carbon credit mechanism. As you design a project, you must understand how it will
score under these metrics and not simply those outlined by prominent western groups
such as the American Carbon Registry. The various carbon credit systems are not
necessarily complementary. Integrating the J-Credit analysis paradigm into project
design at an early stage is crucial to success.

Second, know the kinds of credits that companies want. These instruments come in a
huge variety that relates to how the CO2 was offset or the carbon benefit was
generated or validated. It’s crucial to be familiar with the types of credits that
Japanese firms want to procure to meet customer demand. Also, it’s vital to know
what types of credits trade the most. It’s not worth listing on the TSE only to find out
that your particular flavor of credit does not hold appeal or value for the market.

Finally, build awareness. There will come a time when demand for credits will be
sufficiently high such that simply listing on the TSE will be enough to attract
dealmaking. Until then, developers should invest time into building awareness of their
activities among potential buyers. Japanese firms are unlikely to risk purchasing a

17

credit that they don’t fully understand when there are domestic alternatives that they
have successfully used in the past. Therefore, it’s necessary to engage potential
buyers on the nature and quality of a new credit so they can make informed
purchasing decisions.

The expansion of carbon trading onto the TSE is an exciting opportunity to access a
large and increasingly willing pool of capital. This will drive a host of decarbonization
projects globally and raise efforts in Japan to cut local emissions. With careful analysis,
engagement, and execution, non-Japanese project developers can find success in
helping Japan meet its ambitious 2050 goals.

Diversity vs. Uniformity: An Honest Conversation

In highly-diverse societies such as the United States or Europe, talk of “diversity” in
the labor force has been around for a long time. In Japan, the issue is rather different,
to put it mildly.

Diversity is certainly not the strongest aspect of Japan’s labor market. There is a long
history of local tradition, work culture and institutions that have inhibited the shift from
a uniform working class to one that is more diverse.

You will notice a certain dispersion in the male - female, or foreigner – Japanese,
employee ratio for various sectors of the economy. What you see in the construction
industry will obviously contrast with the apparel sector; while the taxi business will
exhibit a stark contrast compared to the hospitality sector.

If we put aside the recent upheavals caused by Covid-19, then we noticed that over
the past decade various sectors of Japan’s economy have clearly exhibited a tendency
towards more diversity. Today, there are many more young leaders, female
employees, foreign nationals, as well as gender identity individuals working than just a
few years ago.

The problem, however, is that (as demonstrated in the graph below) this process is
proceeding at a glacial pace and the situation is still far from ideal.

Japan’s energy market and, particularly, the renewable energy sector, is not an
exception. According to official statistics, females make up just 14.3% of the labor
force in the electricity, gas, heat supply and water sectors (as of 2019). In such sectors,
the difference in diversity from company to company becomes even more
conspicuous.

Less diverse and agile organizations risk being labeled as maru-dome, which signifies
that they are “too domestic”, “old fashioned” and dominated by overly conservative,

male-only leaders. Recruitment agencies hear such descriptions from their network of
candidates on a daily basis.

Here are a few case studies that are indicative of the changing and challenging labor
market in terms of diversity and perceptions. Recently, Company A invited a young
female candidate to the first, supposedly “casual” interview. The lady met with 3
interviewers, all male, in their late 40s-early 50s. They posed a list of classic, official
interview questions, while providing very little information from their side.

Not surprisingly, the candidate left with the impression that Company A has a very
traditional work culture, which means it is a male dominant, hierarchy-based
organization, where staff are expected to remain until retirement.

Another example involves a company where HR by default required three resumes: a
short and an extended version of the Japanese resume, plus an English one. This is
despite the fact that the hiring manager is a fluent English speaker and competing
companies only require an English resume for the same position. It’s common to see
some excellent candidates lose interest based on that requirement alone. If the job
application process is so rigid and traditional, what are the chances the rest of the
company’s processes are modern and efficient?

Corporate culture is hard to change without inspiring role models. To attract such
caliber of talent, however, requires a willingness to do things differently, overcoming
entrenches attitudes and thought patterns.

Despite some underlying risks, a diverse and inclusive environment helps create a
more healthy, efficient, and hence, competitive business. Companies that fail to do
so, not only miss out on abstract benefits, but often risk getting hit by a very tangible
loss.

So, what can business do about it?

i. Since every organization is different, there’s no magic solution. However, as a
first step you can definitely raise awareness internally and encourage employees’
attention to the issue of diversity. Perhaps some companies can clearly state
internally or externally that they have goals to reach a certain level of females or
young people within their leadership teams. Others might promote workshops
for their employees or hold “awareness weeks”.

ii. Hire or nurture your own role models! You can either hire externally or empower
someone internally. For example, one of the global energy companies that’s
long been established in Japan only had Japanese men in its leadership team.
But this company was very glad to find an overseas born female leader to join
their team. She became a role model for other, more junior, female employees
in the organization. Meanwhile, another company approached this matter by
promoting internally a young, energetic and prominent employee.

iii. Set a clear goal and move forward with small steps. Diversity doesn’t happen in
a day and requires long-term commitment to the goal and effort. We’ve seen
some companies set up a system in which at least one of their three job
interviewers are female. Similar targets can be set for gender diversity of
candidates called up for the first interview. Still other companies have created

20

quotas for underrepresented groups of employees to make them more visible
and more likely to seize their opportunity to shine.

Slowly but surely, diversity is winning over the “old ways”. But as far as Japan is
concerned, a lot more work can and needs to be done. The benefits of change are
sure to follow.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

COP27/ US
U.S. Climate envoy John Kerry tells the COP27 UN climate conference in Egypt that
his country is ready to discuss “loss and damage” issues (i.e. consequences of human-
induced climate change and reparations to countries that have suffered from the
impact).

Africa/ Climate change and natural gas
At the G20 in Bali, Senegal President Macky Sall, who holds the chairmanship of the
African Union, will push for rich nations to fulfil annual pledges of $100 billion to
combat climate change. He’ll also promote the idea of natural gas as a transition fuel.
Senegal will become a gas producer next year.

Australia/ Energy takeover
Brookfield Asset Management and EIG Global Energy Partners will take over one of
Australia’s largest energy companies, Origin Energy, a LNG developer. The A$18.4
billion deal has been called a “once in a generation” opportunity.

Bahrain/ Natural gas
Bahrain made two natural gas discoveries, but their size isn’t yet clear. The two
unconventional gas reservoirs are located under the existing onshore gas-producing
fields of Al-Khuf and Al-Onaiza.

Egypt/ Wind power
The UAE’s leading energy company, Masdar, signed an MoU with Infinity Power and
Hassan Allam Utilities to develop 10 GW of wind power. The project is part of Egypt’s
Green Corridor initiative and will contribute to renewable energy making up 42% of
the national energy mix by 2035.

Germany/ Coal power
A coal-fired power plant in North Rhine-Westphalia that was expected to close in
December will keep running to provide energy for companies on the site. The power
plant is owned by Evonik, one of Germany’s largest chemical companies.

India/ LNG purchases
Industrial customers are buying less LNG due to high prices and seek alternatives.
Storage tanks at Dahej and Hazira LNG import terminals are near maximum capacity
and scheduled deliveries may need to be delayed.

Netherlands/ Offshore wind power
RWE will build a 700 MW offshore wind farm in the North Sea. The project won’t get
subsidies on the energy produced. The wind farm will be operational by 2026 and will
provide around 6% of Dutch electricity consumption.

Russia/ LNG sales
Russian LNG suppliers are selling cargoes in Asia at close to spot market prices,
indicating that fears of sanctions on Russia’s exports have lessened. Earlier this year,
buyers in Asia purchased LNG from Russia at steep discounts amid concerns about
potential sanctions.

Spain/ Energy transition
Iberdrola will invest €47 billion in electricity networks and renewable energy
production over the next two years. Half will go to networks in Britain, Brazil, Spain
and the U.S. Since 2020, the company has invested €30 billion, and a further €65-75
billion is planned for 2026 to 2030.

Turkey/ Renewable energy
International Holding Co acquired a 50% stake in Kalyon Enerji for $490 million. The
deal includes solar power projects in the Karapınar and Gaziantep regions and a wind
farm in Ankara. The deal is one of IHC's largest renewables acquisitions ever.

UK/ Qatar/ LNG expansion
Qatar Energy and ExxonMobil are investing heavily to boost capacity at their South
Hook LNG terminal in Milford Haven (Wales). The import terminal will be modernized
to allow it to handle about 25% more imported LNG.
