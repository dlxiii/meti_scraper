NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


SoftBank and OpenAI back AI infrastructure project in U.S.

(Financial Times, Jan 21)
•  OpenAI and SoftBank plan to spend $100 billion on building a U.S. artificial intelligence
infrastructure project, dubbed Stargate, with the figure rising to as much as $500 billion over the
next four years.
•  President Trump announced the project on Jan 21, in the presence of SoftBank chair Son
Masayoshi, OpenAI chief Sam Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.
•  “This is the beginning of a golden age,” said Son, adding that the company would not have made
the investment had Trump not won re-election. Son has a sweeping vision for what SoftBank can do
in AI, from robotics to data centers, underpinned by his UK-based semiconductor designer Arm,
which he wants to produce its own chips.
•  The SoftBank founder has also a significant stake in OpenAI. SoftBank’s shares rose more than 10%
in Tokyo on Jan 22 after the news.
•  Stargate aims to boost capacity to run new AI models. It’ll initially build a data center in Texas —
construction is already under way, the companies said.
•  CONTEXT: The announcement comes as tech execs court Trump, who is eager to score investment wins.
Trump said Stargate would keep “the future of technology” in America. SoftBank has ultimate financial
responsibility for the new company, with OpenAI taking operational responsibility. Son will chair the
JV. Abu Dhabi’s AI-focused state fund MGX and Oracle are also providing funding; SoftBank-owned
Arm, and Microsoft and Nvidia will be technology partners.
• TAKEAWAY: The rapid development of AI systems over the past two years has strained U.S. infrastructure, with
data centers emerging as a bottleneck. Cutting-edge chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and
Anthropic’s Claude require enormous amounts of data, computing power, and electricity. The Stargate project
will likely be significant for more than AI – it will upend the energy strategy of the U.S. and likely influence
actions in Japan. According to various U.S. sector specialists, each of the $100 billion super-computers that the
project aims to build (and there could be five in total) will require about 5-6 GW of capacity. Due to the 24/7
nature of the facilities, that capacity will need to be firm, which implies that solar and wind power supplies will
have to be backed by ample battery installations or have other options to fill the gap during low-generation
times. While talk among major U.S. IT firms is now around nuclear power, Son became a vocal nuclear critic in
the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan. The prospects of bringing new nuclear capacity
online in time for the launch of the first Stargate hub are also dim. It took 15 years to build two new units at
the Vogtle nuclear station in the U.S., and the added capacity is less than half of the demand for one Stargate.
Putting aside questions of cost, the sheer scale of the undertaking has some suggesting that most of the
electricity will come from burning natural gas. That tallies with the favorable environment that President
Trump seeks to create for the domestic oil and gas industry. It does, however, make corporate pledges of net
zero by 2030 much harder to execute.




Japan tightens foreign investment rules to protect national security
(Nikkei, Jan 22)
•  Japan will introduce a new pre-screening system for foreign investments, targeting firms potentially
cooperating with foreign governments. Designated as "specific foreign investors," these entities must
submit prior notifications for all projects, addressing concerns over information leaks, particularly
around Chinese firms.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Current exemptions for investments below 10% of shares in "core industries", such as nuclear and
telecommunications, will no longer apply to “specific foreign investors”.
•  The move follows incidents such as Tencent taking a 3.65% stake in mobile operator Rakuten. The
deal bypassed pre-screening, raising security concerns due to China's 2017 law mandating
cooperation of Chinese firms with state intelligence efforts.
•  The revised regulations will require prior notifications for any acquisition of 1% or more of listed
shares in regulated sectors, regardless of exemptions. These rules also apply to organizations
substantially controlled by “specific foreign investors” or with more than 50% voting rights owned
by them.
•  CONTEXT: Amid rising global security concerns, similar measures have been enacted internationally,
such as the U.S. FIRRMA law (2018) and the EU's 2019 framework for scrutinizing foreign investments
in sensitive sectors like semiconductors. Japan seeks to balance stricter rules with attracting foreign
investment to support economic growth.



Govt to codify emissions trading: GX amendment to be submitted to Diet
(Denki Shimbun, Jan 21)
•  On Jan 24, the govt submitted to the Diet an amendment to the GX Promotion Law to set up a legal
framework for a CO₂ emissions trading system. It launches in FY2026. Companies emitting over
100,000 tons of CO₂ a year will have to participate.
•  The amendment also seeks to lock in the introduction of fossil fuel surcharges in FY2028. It
includes penalties for non-payment, and exemptions for fuels not used in the country. Companies
will calculate their emissions and offset them with allowances.

•  These free allocations will also take into account risks such as the relocation of manufacturing to
third countries. Other risks considered are R&D trends in GX-related technologies and changes in
facility operations.
•  To ensure price stability within the emissions trading market, there’ll be a price floor and ceiling. If
allowance prices have a sharp rise, companies could pay a set price to meet obligations. If prices
fall, the GX Promotion Organization will intervene by purchasing allowances.
•  Participating companies will also have to establish medium- to long-term emissions reduction
targets.
• TAKEAWAY: Most of this information was already part of the GX strategy unveiled over the past 18 months.
However, it will now move into law. The steady approach of the officials has frustrated some who wished for
the government to introduce carbon taxes or compulsory carbon caps and trading earlier. Still, this approach
allows for the companies to prepare for changes that will take place as soon as 14 months from now. We expect
this to present huge opportunities for carbon credits generation, though the application of overseas credits to
the Japanese market is yet to be clarified.



METI proposes FY2025 auction criteria for renewables projects
(Government statement, Jan 17)
•  METI proposed a new auction system starting FY2025. For utility-scale solar power, auctions will be
held four times a year, with prices disclosed in advance. The initial auction will target 79 MW.
•  For onshore wind power, 900 MW will be offered; if total bids exceed 1.2 GW, then there’ll be
additional auctions. Rates will be disclosed in advance.
•  For offshore wind projects not covered by the Renewable Energy Sea Area Utilization Act, 190 MW
will be offered; prices won’t be disclosed beforehand.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  For biomass, 30 MW will be offered in categories such as general wood-based fuels (10 MW and
above) and liquid fuels (all scales), with prices undisclosed.
•  METI also proposed removing biomass categories such as general wood-based fuels (10 MW and
above) and liquid fuels from the FIT/FIP.
•  For existing projects, to prevent conversion to thermal power after the procurement period ends,
METI plans to monitor biomass usage ratios through regular reporting and change notifications. If
the biomass ratio falls below a certain threshold, corrective measures will be issued.


NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS



OCCTO  issues nationwide power demand forecasts through FY2034
(OCCTO statement, Jan 22)
•  OCCTO announced nationwide power demand forecasts over the next ten years. By FY2034,
maximum nationwide power demand is predicted to reach 164.6 GW, and electricity demand at
852.4 TWh.
•  For FY2033, the maximum power demand forecast was revised upwards by 3.1 GW, and electricity
demand was revised upwards by 18 TWh.
•  In the residential sector, a downward trend is expected to continue as energy conservation is more
widespread and energy efficiency improves. The commercial sector’s demand is expected to remain
flat over the forecast period.
•  The industrial sector’s demand is expected to grow due to the proliferation of new data centers and
semiconductor factories. The forecasts up to FY2029 are lower than previous ones, but the forecasts
from FY2030 onwards are expected to be higher than the previous ones as those high tech projects
come online.
•  The increase in maximum power due to the construction of new data centers and semiconductor
factories was projected separately. In FY2034, the maximum power forecast is 6.16 GW for data
centers (vs 470 MW in FY2025) and 0.99 GW for semiconductor factories (vs 90 MW in FY2025).
Electricity demand is forecasted at 44 TWh for data centers and 7.3 TWh for semiconductor
factories, accounting for about 4.3% of the nation’s peak demand by FY2034 (vs 0.4% in FY2025).
•  CONTEXT: Every year, OCCTO publishes estimated demand, which is the sum of estimated demand for
each service area. It also checks on the validity and compliance with the guidelines for electricity
transmission/distribution and demand estimation of each TSO.
• TAKEAWAY: We view the latest forecasts as very conservative. The Rapidus chip plant being built in the

Hokkaido region is due to go into mass-production around FY2027 and, according to its management, will
require 600 MW capacity all by itself. TSMC in Kyushu is planning a second chip plant in the prefecture. While
OCCTO likely sees energy efficiency as a counterbalance, the absolute size of power demand growth from the
data sector is likely to result in much higher net gains in GWs.



EEX power futures trading volume surged fourfold in 2024
(Exchange statement, Jan 24)
•  EEX-cleared power futures grew fourfold YoY to 72.9 TWh in 2024, with the number of trading
participants rising 30% to 89 companies (44 Japanese, 45 foreign). This marked the highest annual
growth rate among EEX-operated power markets globally.
•  Trade volume reached 85,779 contracts.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: On Feb 3, EEX plans to launch power futures options and screen-based trading ("order
book") by March, alongside annual futures covering up to six years.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s power futures market was one of the biggest energy stories of 2024. The growth is set to
continue with ICE entering the market as another platform promoting electricity derivatives trading, and thanks
to a continued flow of new trading participants. However, as the market platforms add more contract options, it
will be important to see whether the liquidity splits. The arrival of the JJ-Link system, which syncs TOCOM
futures with the JEPX wholesale market, is another one to watch this year.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Spot market supply increased in Dec, avoiding supply-demand tightness
(Denki Shimbun, Jan 22)
o  Daily average spot market supply in December increased 18.8% MoM to 1.26 TWh, while
demand (buy bids) rose 9.4% to 978.5 GWh, according to JEPX data.
o  Total monthly supply rose 22.7% to 38.9 TWh; demand rose 13.1% to 30.3 GWh.
o  Stable operations of thermal and nuclear power plants, including the Shimane NPP Unit 2
restart in late December, ensured ample supply during the winter peak.
o  Supply-demand conditions remained loose, with selling bids peaking at 39.2 GWh (Dec
31), and demand at 27.6 GWh (Dec 20).



EPRX prepares system upgrade for FY2025 demand adjustment market

(Denki Shimbun, Jan 20)
•  The Electric Power Reserve Exchange (EPRX) held an online briefing on Jan 17 to discuss system
changes for FY2025, with over 140 participants, including trading members and prospective
entrants.
•  Adjustments for “tertiary reserve (2)” will shorten bid intervals from 3 hours to 30 minutes, and
revise activation and duration to within 60 and 30 minutes, respectively.
•  System testing is scheduled for Feb 3–28, with the switchover planned for March 12–13, after
which FY2025 operations will begin for March 14 deliveries.
•  Unlike previous years, there’s no backup date for potential delays in the transition.

•  CONTEXT: In December, Hitachi Energy acquired the existing property. The new expanded factory is
scheduled to launch in fall 2026.
• TAKEAWAY: The factory addresses growing global demand for power transmission equipment as the energy

transition gathers steam and energy demand rises to power new technologies such as AI. Utilities must
modernize and strengthen their power systems to accommodate these developments.


NEWS:    HYDROGEN



Hydrogen strategy faces challenge from China’s rapid advances: Nikkei
(Nikkei, Jan 18)
•  CONTEXT: This is part-commentary, part analysis, warning that Japan risks losing its leadership in
hydrogen tech. It calls on the govt and industry to move quicker.
•  Nikkei raises concerns that Japan’s "adjustment-based" industrial policies focus narrowly on fuel cell
cars and household usage while relying on hydrogen imports, which limits innovation and
competitiveness.
•  Major power sources for green hydrogen, such as offshore wind, are under-developed due to
unclear national goals and risk aversion by industry players.
•  Meanwhile, China’s hydrogen industry is rapidly advancing with a "low-altitude economy" strategy,
leveraging state-driven innovation to dominate the global hydrogen supply chain, including
production, transportation, storage, and usage. The “low-altitude” term in China refers to economic
activities that take place in low airspace, such as drones for delivery, surveillance, etc.
•  These strategies, backed by state investment and a call for mass production, will see China produce
more than 50% of the world's green hydrogen, or about 220,000 tons.

MLIT sets up floating offshore wind tech research association
(Government statement, Jan 16)
•  The Floating Offshore Wind Construction System Technology Research Association (FLOWCON)
has been set up with MLIT approval to develop a system for large-scale deployment of floating
offshore wind power.
•  The association includes seven core member firms: Penta-Ocean Construction, Toa, Toyo
Construction, Nippon Steel Engineering, Wakachiku Construction, IHI Transport Machinery, and
Sumitomo Heavy Industries.
•  It will work with three supporting members — Kanadevia (formerly Hitachi Zosen), JFE
Engineering, and Japan Marine United.
•  FLOWCON aims to achieve rapid, large-scale construction and cost-efficient development. Its efforts
will focus on three key areas:
o  Research on construction systems for floating offshore wind power;

o  Development of technologies necessary for offshore construction bases;
o  Development of weather and sea condition forecasting systems for marine construction.
•  Initially, the group will focus on one of the most critical aspects of offshore construction:
installation of wind turbines onto floating platforms. It will compare and evaluate installation at
base ports vs installation at offshore construction bases.
•  FLOWCON will also collaborate with the Floating Offshore Wind Technology Research Association
(FLOWRA), led by power generation companies and that operates under METI’S approval.
• TAKEAWAY: The govt seeks to speed up development of infrastructure and technological systems needed to

TEPCO to complete Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP restart and post-Fukushima restructuring
(Nikkei, Jan 22)
•  TEPCO and the Nuclear Damage Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation will draft a
restructuring plan by the end of FY2024 for scenarios to restart the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP.
Possibilities include a restart in FY2025 or delaying it to FY2026, or even later.
•  The plan, called the General Special Business Plan, needs state approval. It will address TEPCO's
over ¥16 trillion debt from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
•  CONTEXT: Restarting one reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa could improve revenue by ¥100 billion a
year. TEPCO's free cash flow has been negative for six consecutive years, with a cumulative deficit of
¥1.2 trillion. Despite a net profit in FY2024, major safety investments have strained the firm’s finances.
•  In FY2024, capital investment plans are about ¥1 trillion. Interest-bearing debt is rising to ¥6.5
trillion. Asset sales and cost-cutting have reached their limits, leaving little room for growth
investments.
•  CONTEXT: Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s restart is part of a broader shift in energy policy outlined in the 7th
Basic Energy Plan. Now, the goal is to boost renewables’ share of the national power mix to 40-50% by
2040, with nuclear power holding at 20%.
• TAKEAWAY: The restart is not only important for TEPCO's financial recovery, but also essential for meeting
national energy goals. Without the restart, the existence of TEPCO in its current structure will be questioned

and may spur a broader restructuring of the holding.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan Wary of Energy Policy Upheaval as Trump Returns

President Donald Trump’s swift rollback of climate policies during his first week in
office marks a stark departure from his predecessor’s agenda. In ordering a pullout of
the Paris Agreement and prioritizing fossil fuel production, the administration has
declared energy dominance its central goal. While wind projects and green subsidies are
on pause, permits for new oil and gas infrastructure will be fast-tracked.
In Japan, the response is mixed. METI welcomed the potential boost to LNG exports,
but the announced exit from the Paris Agreement (for a second time) is a concern
because the Agreement is a catalyst for international carbon accounting and trading,
which Japan sees as business opportunities and vital in meeting net-zero goals.

As METI collects the last of the feedback on its next Basic Energy Plan draft, with a view
of presenting a final version in February, the Trump Administration’s tone may tip the
balance between energy security and climate commitments.

Part 1: What the White House announced

President Trump’s America First Priorities
In his first days in office, Trump issued a number of energy, climate and trade policies
that may be relevant to Japan. Aiming to expand U.S. energy production and
streamlining regulations, the White House has:
• Ordered a withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement
o This includes the key Article 6, which governs the international crediting of
CO2 reductions and potential trading of such reductions as offset credits
• Halted offshore wind farm leases on the outer continental shelf
o Existing leases will remain intact but undergo comprehensive reviews to
assess ecological, economic, and environmental impacts
o High-profile projects may face additional moratoriums, delays, or potential
cancellations
o An immediate halt on leases from Jan 21, 2025 will affect both onshore
and offshore projects
• Declared an energy emergency
o Enables shortcuts which circumnavigate current regulations, especially
regarding permitting and environmental assessments
o Calls for lower reliance on non-U.S. supply chains
• Abolished the previous administration’s freeze on new LNG export licenses
• Revoked a ban on offshore oil and gas leases that enable drilling in coastal waters
• Vowed to refill the U.S. strategic oil reserve to the maximum
• Revoked Biden’s electric vehicle mandate that wanted 50% of U.S. new car sales by
2030 to be EVs
• Put on pause subsidies related to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) pending a review by the new
administration to ensure they adhere to new energy strategy
o The office set up to distribute the funds related to the above acts, had
made 55 conditional commitments totaling $109 billion and closed 25
deals totaling $61 billion in loans and loan guarantees
o As of December, 191 “active” deals that had requested $298 billion
Trump vowed to “unleash American energy” by ending what he called “climate
extremism” policies. This stands in stark contrast to Biden’s push for decarbonized

power sources, and translates into ending his predecessor’s policies on climate action.
The above indicate renewed support for the oil, gas, and nuclear industries, and an end
to federal government support of renewable energy, such as offshore wind. Trump
plans to loosen emission regulations, and revise or repeal tax incentives for some clean
energy projects and for EVs.
Also, Trump has made aggressive statements to return the Panama Canal to U.S.
ownership. Whether that is a bluff or not, it indicates a desire to regain control of a key
logistics hub through which a big number of U.S. LNG carriers and other vessels travel.

National energy emergency

Trump’s goal is to expedite domestic energy development, with a strong emphasis on
critical minerals and fossil fuel energy infrastructure. Measures include fast-tracking
permitting and accelerating projects in Alaska, the Northeast and the West Coast. The
Defense Production Act and amendments to the Endangered Species Act will be utilized
to overcome current regulation and other obstacles.
Meanwhile, Trump issued orders to revoke those of the previous administration:

1. Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the
Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis);
2. Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive
Orders Concerning Federal Regulation);
3. Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at
Home and Abroad);
4. Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of Advisors on
Science and Technology);
5. Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing
Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change
on Migration);
6. Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change
Support Office);
7. Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk);
8. Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership
in Clean Cars and Trucks);
9. Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy
Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability);
10. Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation’s Forests,
Communities, and Local Economies);
11. Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy
and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and
12. Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation’s
Commitment to Environmental Justice for All).
As Trump said in his inauguration speech, his focus will be boosting oil and gas output,
and expanding energy exports: "We will be a rich nation again and it is the liquid gold
under our feet that will help us do it."
Part 2: Reaction in Japan

METI Minister Muto
Muto emphasized that climate change is a global issue requiring all nations' efforts. He
said Japan will continue to decarbonize and pursue international initiatives like the Asia
Zero Emission Community (AZEC).

16



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Muto commended Trump’s stance to resume LNG export approvals. If implemented,
“this could stabilize global LNG markets and support Japan’s energy security by
diversifying import sources.”
PM Ishiba’s administration
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi reaffirmed the importance of the alliance with the U.S.
as a cornerstone of Japan’s foreign and security policy. He expressed hope for early
talks between PM Ishiba and Trump to “build a strong, trusting relationship and elevate
Japan-U.S. ties.”

On the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, Hayashi said climate change remains
a pressing global issue and that the U.S. should be involved. Japan will seek ways to
cooperate with the U.S. on climate issues.

Political parties
Komeito leader Saito expressed concern over Trump's decision to withdraw from the
Paris Agreement, stating, "The U.S. must work with others to address global challenges,
but I am worried about how this system will be maintained." He emphasized the
importance of building a strong relationship of trust between PM Ishiba and Trump.
Communist Party Secretary-General Koike criticized Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement and from the WHO. The "America-First" stance could lead to contradictions
with allied countries and that Japan should not be a passive follower; it should insist on
its own position when necessary.

Business / industry response
Top big-business lobby, Keidanren:
Keidanren welcomed Trump’s reelection, but appealed to him to maintain bilateral ties.
The group remains supportive of the central role of the U.S. to the global economy and
climate action, emphasizing that the U.S. is Japan’s most important ally. It pointed out
that Japan has been the top investor in the U.S. for the last five years, and Japanese
companies have created nearly one million jobs there. The group urged the Trump
Administration to create a predictable, stable environment to allow businesses to invest
with confidence.
Non-profit group Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI):
While Japan supports decarbonization efforts through initiatives like AZEC, it views the
potential LNG policy changes as a way to enhance energy security and diversify imports.
It stressed the importance of IRA-linked loans and grants to reduce GHG emissions, but
warned that it’s now unlikely that the prior administration’s climate/ energy targets will
be met. The Institute forecasts that the gap between 2050 net-zero goals and reality will
widen.
High-ranking official at pro-renewables organization:
Trump’s stance on the climate crisis is already affecting Japan and the policy direction it
is about to take. His reelection came just as Japan was drafting the new Energy Basic
Plan, which is expected to be finalized next month. “Japan has most likely set targets
for [renewables] energy sources much lower, mirroring Trump’s comments,” the official
said.

The Renewable Energy Institute (REI):
In early November, following Trump's re-election, REI highlighted concerns about U.S.
federal government disengagement from climate action. It said, however, that global
and domestic progress on renewables and coal reduction during his previous term
suggests that a transition to clean energy, driven by economic and corporate interests, is

17

irreversible. REI said Japan must not slow its climate actions, otherwise it will fail its
climate responsibility and harm its international competitiveness.

Political commentator Takeda Tsuneyasu (great-great-grandson of the Emperor Meiji):
He said that Japan also withdrew from the Paris Agreement. “It makes no sense for
Japan to invest ¥150 trillion in decarbonization when the top four emitters are doing
virtually nothing.” He said that putting public funds into GX in such an environment
was a “misuse of taxpayer money.”
Japanese Youth Organization SWiTCH
Saza Mana, the leader of Japanese youth organization "SWiTCH," and a Japan
delegation member at COP29 last year, said that the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement will have a significant impact on international relations, including a loss of
funding to developing nations. She forecasts that Japan and European countries will fill
the gap.

Regular member of METI expert committees:
Professor Takamura Yukari of University of Tokyo’s Institute for Future Initiatives
expressed concern about Trump’s actions, highlighting the potential negative impact on
global climate action. However, she noted that many countries and companies are ready
to continue advancing such goals and see climate change as a direct risk to their
operations.
Part 3: Potential impact

Japan’s LNG supply from Russia’s Sakhalin-2 project
On January 10, the U.S. announced additional economic sanctions against Russia.
Among these, over 100 tankers, referred to as the "shadow fleet," were added to the
sanctions list. However, on Jan 21, METI Minister Muto reiterated that the U.S.
sanctions do not affect Japan’s supply of LNG from the Sakhalin-2 project in Russia.
Japanese businesses investing in EV-related projects in the U.S.
Chemical company UBE: Set to invest $500 million to build the first U.S. plant
producing dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), essential
chemicals for EV batteries. Located in Louisiana, the facility is planned to open in late
2026.

Panasonic: Plans a third EV battery plant in the U.S. despite scrapping a tentative plan
in 2023. The company is a supplier to Tesla. Panasonic's $4 billion EV battery plant In
De Soto, Kansas, hopes for launch early in 2025.

Komatsu: Japanese heavy equipment maker revealed last December plans a fourfold
expansion of production capacity for batteries at its U.S. unit, eyeing the mining
industry's growing push toward electrification and decarbonization.
Toyota Motor: Increased its investment in a Greensboro, North Carolina-area plant to
make batteries for fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars. Production at the new plant,
which is under construction, will be expanded as part of a $13.9 billion outlay.

Japanese businesses investing in wind projects in the U.S.
JERA: Recently signed an agreement with BP to merge their offshore wind power
businesses under a standalone joint venture. Both BP and JERA eyed the U.S. market as
part of their investment strategy, hoping to build 13 GW of capacity.

Japan Looks to the Moon and Beyond to Tackle Resources Scarcity

Over the last decade, nearly $300 billion has been poured into equity investments in
private space companies. The U.S. captured almost half of this, China close to a third.
Japan, by contrast, has barely registered – until now.

Japan’s nascent space startup sector, which quietly emerged in the 2010s, is finally
taking off as a real business. Last month, the fourth Japanese space startup in two years
held an IPO. A few weeks ago, Toyota Motor announced a second investment in a space
startup, and last year, the government launched a multi-billion-dollar fund to support
private space firms over the next decade.
The space boom has several practical applications to Japan’s energy sector. Some of
these startups are testing energy production technologies in the stratosphere and above,
seeking either to beam electrons back down to Earth or create fuel to power further
space exploration. China has similar plans, recently unveiling a project to build an
orbiting solar power station with 1 MW of capacity by 2030.

There is another vital reason for Japan to explore space: raw materials. With sparse key
resources within its own land mass, the country is searching for new sources of critical
elements such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earths. These materials are
indispensable for everything from batteries to wind turbines, and chips for
decentralized energy systems. And certain parts of space are estimated to hold an
astronomical amount of these elements.
Unlocking the Moon’s potential
Pursuing deep space exploration is still far away, but one celestial body that’s assessed
as a valuable resource target is visible to the naked eye nearly every night.

Many scientists believe that the Moon and Earth share a common origin, implying that
the former contains many of the same materials and minerals as found on Earth. That’s
one reason Tokyo-based lunar exploration startup ispace launched a mission to the
Earth’s satellite on Jan 15, aiming to help build an ecosystem and infrastructure for
space exploration that will help other businesses pursue energy and mining projects.
On the back of a SpaceX rocket, launched from Florida, ispace is carrying a payload for
Japan’s Takasago Thermal Engineering, which produces hydrogen through electrolysis
and wants to trial the same in outer space.

As part of its flagship lunar program, HAKUTO-R, ispace also plans to collect regolith
using a Swedish shovel made by excavation equipment producer Epiroc. Regolith refers
to dust and rock fragments covering the Moon’s surface, which will be used as a
building material for in-situ resource utilization. The firm will sell part of the regolith to
NASA.
In 2010, the Japanese space agency, JAXA, led a mission to successfully bring back
samples from the asteroid known as Itokawa. In 2020, a second mission returned
samples from the asteroid Ryugu, which are being analyzed for organic compounds and
minerals.

Mining just one of the reachable asteroids closest to Earth’s orbit could yield fantastic
profits in the trillion-dollar range despite billions of dollars in outlays. One asteroid
observed by NASA a little further out ‒ 16 Psyche ‒ is reported to carry enough gold

that in theory it would be a hypothetical $93 billion windfall (at today’s market prices)
for every single person on earth.

With the expenses involved high, and the risk even higher, Japan is following the U.S.
in allowing more space sector development to be conducted by private capital and
businesses, with the state space agency as the coordinating hub.
For firms like ispace, this is a chance to be at the forefront of developing technologies to
utilize lunar resources, with the vision of creating a sustainable space-based economy.

Why bother with space?
With many metals and minerals still abundant on Earth, why bother with venturing into
space? Access to minerals is becoming increasingly tangled in geopolitics, with supply of
some materials limited, held up or stopped altogether on political and ideological
grounds. For example, China dominates the mining and processing for more than half
of the key metals and minerals required for energy transition technologies.

As U.S.-China trade tensions increase, there is concern about China’s efforts to restrict
raw material exports, as it has done in the past with rare earth elements and more
recently with critical minerals gallium and antimony.
The cost of mining is also increasing globally due to depletion of the easier-access
deposits, declining ore grades, and the difficulties in securing water and other
resources. Community opposition is also a challenge in almost every jurisdiction and
can lead to the shutdown of even operating assets. In 2019, the Cobre Panamá mine in
Panama started to supply about 1% of the world’s copper, but in 2023 a local court
ruled to shut the mine due to protests over its environmental impact.

The biggest issue for land-based mining, however, may be the timescale of developing
new deposits. The average time required to start a new mining operation from scratch
rose to 18 years, up from 16 years, according to the latest estimate published by the
International Energy Agency in 2024. For the U.S., the average timeframe is now over
20 years.
Faced with such long-term investment prospects on Earth, the Moon and asteroids may
not be such a wild gamble after all. And Japan’s demand for raw materials is only
growing.

The country’s land mass has almost no nickel, cobalt, bauxite, nitrates, rock salt, potash
and phosphates. Yet all these are key to clean energy technologies. In 2022, Japan
imported $1.07 billion worth of lithium carbonates, making it the third-largest importer
globally. In the same year, Japan imported $585 million worth of cobalt, ranking as the
No.2 importer.
The Moon’s lack of atmosphere also makes it uniquely suited for resource exploration.
Unlike Earth, where asteroid impacts are often mitigated by the atmosphere, the lunar
surface has been directly bombarded by asteroids over billions of years. This may have
enriched the Moon’s surface with reserves of rare and valuable materials.

ispace’s role in Japan’s energy transition
Once commercially-viable travel to the Moon becomes possible, it should also be
sustainable. To do that, a sound economic system is required, says CEO of Tokyo-based
ispace, Hakamada Takeshi. He believes that the initial driving force would be utilization
of water resources on the lunar surface. Hydrogen extracted from the water could then
be used as a fuel for rockets.

20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

ispace drew global attention with its HAKUTO-R Mission 1 in 2023, although the
mission did not successfully complete a soft landing on the Moon. Despite the setback, it
demonstrated ispace’s ability to develop and operate advanced lunar technology. METI
selected the firm for a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant worth ¥12
billion.
Now, ispace partners with organizations like NASA and uses rockets supplied by SpaceX
to deliver payloads and collect crucial data. The landers and rovers are designed not
only to support scientific research but also to lay the groundwork for infrastructure
needed to extract and process lunar materials.

The startup is one of over 100 companies involved in space exploration in Japan today.

Building a sustainable space economy
While Japan’s ispace is not itself a miner, it has signed agreements with domestic and
international mining firms seeking to haul in such gains. The role of ispace will be to
enable these entities to expand their operations both into and in space, confirming its
place as an infrastructure builder in what could become an immensely lucrative
industry.
From the nation’s perspective, there’s more than money at stake. Space R&D has
historically propelled advancement across key computing, machinery, energy, materials,
and a host of other sectors. Beyond that, the potential for resource procurement outside
of its isles could offer Japan a competitive advantage in a geopolitically constrained
world.

The new space race has just begun.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Energy storage
The govt has allocated an additional AU$2 billion to its green bank, the Clean Energy
Finance Corporation (CEFC), to support renewable energy generation and storage.
China / Power consumption
In 2024, the country’s total electricity consumption was 9,852 TWh, a YoY increase of
6.8%, which is more than the GDP growth of 5%. This phenomenon is partly due to the
continuous increase in electrification across industries such as construction and
transportation, significantly boosting energy demand.

China / Renewable energy
With increased renewable energy capacity, by 2025 renewable sources will meet all of
China’s new electricity demand. This paves the way for China’s power sector to achieve
peak emissions by 2025, said Greenpeace East Asia.
India / Oil imports
The state agency in charge of shipping has extended permission to both sanctioned and
authorized Russian insurance companies to provide policies for Russian oil tankers
shipping to Indian customers. Recent U.S. sanctions have targeted Russian shipping
companies and insurers. India is the world’s third largest oil buyer.

Nepal / Hydropower
India’s Renewable Energy Development Agency will create a JV with SJVN, GMR
Energy, and Nepal Electricity Authority to develop the 900 MW Upper Karnali
Hydroelectric Project in Nepal.
Nuclear power
Global nuclear energy is projected to make a strong comeback this year with more than
70 GW of new capacity under construction. According to the IEA, this is one of the
highest levels in the past 30 years. There are over 40 countries with plans to expand
nuclear power in their energy systems.

Singapore / Energy corridor
Singapore and India are studying the establishment of an energy corridor that will focus
on renewables between the two countries, said the Ministry of External Affairs. The
Singapore govt said there is already some work on a green hydrogen corridor between
the two.
Southeast Asia / Renewable energy
SUSI Partners raised an additional $139 million for its SE Asia-focused energy transition
strategy, bringing the total fund to $259 million. The investment includes significant
contributions from British International Investment and Dutch development bank FMO,
with $70 mln and $50 mln allocated, respectively. These funds will support the SUSI
Asia Energy Transition Fund and the Sustainable Asia Renewable Assets (SARA)
platform that aims to develop a 500 MW portfolio of greenfield renewable energy
projects across SE Asia.
South Korea / Biomass
South Korea will not support any new biomass power plants. Subsidies for six existing
state-owned plants that co-fire coal and biomass will end this year; the value of

22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

renewable energy certificates for three state-owned dedicated biomass plants will be
phased down by 2027. At privately owned plants, subsidies for co-fired biomass from
six plants will be phased out over the next decade, while subsidies will be reduced for
12 dedicated biomass plants over the next 15 years.
Taiwan / Offshore wind
