• TAKEAWAY: The move is a major change for METI, which previously drove energy transition through
voluntarism and “co-regulation”, rather than laws. Some are likely to call for incentives to push stronger
requirements on businesses. According to Australia’s Lynas, the largest rare earth producer outside of China, 1
million units of EVs requires 600 tons of neodymium and praseodymium, and 1 GW of offshore wind turbines
need 300 tons of neodymium praseodymium oxide. Japan imported 8,475 tons of rare earths in 2021: 4,778

tons from China, and 3,073 tons from Vietnam.


METI advisors stress the importance of nuclear power for energy security
(Japan NRG, March 1)
•  METI advisors at the Clean Energy Strategy Conference stressed the potential of nuclear power as
the Ukraine conflict revealed energy security risks.

•  CONTEXT: Following the 2011 Fukushima accident, 13 new nuclear plant projects and feasibility
studies were suspended, and one was scrapped.
•  Nuclear power is a continual process and stopping means throwing away the technologies built up
over years. China and Russia are developing advanced nuclear reactors. Japan should collaborate
more with the U.S., UK, France and South Korea, the advisors said.
•  Another panelist said that a review of long-term gas procurement strategy is needed since gas use

will gradually decline, to be replaced 1% with synthetic methane by 2030 and 90% in 2050.
• TAKEAWAY: Nuclear ambitions are growing in other countries, including those that do not currently have the
technology, such as the Philippines and Singapore. Small modular reactors (SMR), said to be safer than the
current reactors, are driving this interest. The U.S. Nuclear Energy Institute forecasts half of global nuclear
capacity will be in Asia and Oceania in 2050, increasing three-fold from today.

• Japan’s nuclear component exports slumped to ¥21.4 billion in 2020, from ¥131.4 billion in 2010. China and
Russia jointly have a 60% share of pressurized water reactors under construction and 55% share of new PWR
projects. METI aims for Japan’s resurgence in SMR, high temperature gas reactor, and fast-neutron reactor
markets.



Coal-ammonia co-firing potential seen at 25.5 GW for 2050

(Japan NRG, Feb. 25)
•  Japan’s best potential for ammonia co-firing at utility-owned coal power plants is 25.5 GW in 2050,
according to METI calculations. After removing inefficient units, Japan’s coal power capacity will
be at 35 GW in 2050, down from 40 GW today.
•  Ammonia co-firing requires additional space of 15,000 m3 or more for storage, gasification and
other equipment.
•  Not all plants will be expandable, said a METI survey. 40 power plants account for the 25.5 GW

capacity. 20% ammonia co-firing will require 11 million tons of ammonia, according to METI.
•  CONTEXT: JERA last month announced a global tender for ammonia supply. It is seeking half a
million tons a year from FY2027.

NEWS:     POWER      MARKETS






Solar cell maker raises prices by 20% based on rising raw material costs
(Kankyo Business, March 3)
•  Kaneka Corporation will raise the prices of all solar cell products by more than 20% from April 1
due to rising input costs.
•  The price of silicon wafers, the main raw material for solar cells, has skyrocketed due to the global
shortage of silicon raw materials. In addition, the price of other raw materials, such as high-
transmission glass, and rising logistics costs have also put pressure on business earnings, resulting

in the latest price increase.
•  The company said it reached a limit on how much it can absorb rising costs.
• TAKEAWAY: The cost of solar panels has fallen continuously for years, but all signs indicate this trend is now
played out or about to take a multi-year pause. The price of raw materials for clean energy products has been
rising quickly and is now accelerating. This is in part due to the higher fossil fuel prices that feed into industrial
power generation and transport costs.

NEWS:     OIL,   GAS   &  MINING







War in Ukraine and rising energy prices:
PM Kishida says Japan firms in Russian oil projects will decide exit by themselves

(Reuters, Jiji, Kyodo and Japan NRG, March 2-4)
o  CONTEXT: Japanese companies are investors in several Russian oil and gas projects. The
two most prominent are Sakhalin-I (led by ExxonMobil) and Sakhalin-II (led by Shell).
Exxon and Shell say they’ll seek to exit.
o  CONTEXT: Japanese investors haven’t yet made clear their position. In Sakhalin I,
Japanese consortium SODECO owns a 30% stake. In Sakhalin II, trading houses Mitsui &
Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. own 12.5% and 10%, respectively.

o  PM Kishida was asked if Japanese companies should follow their western peers in exiting
Russian projects. He told a parliamentary committee that Japanese firms are private
businesses and must make their “own” decision. The government will only consult with
the private sector and cooperate where necessary.
o  Kishida also said Japan will "suspend for the time being" all Russian economic projects.
o  The PM added that energy security must be protected as much as possible and that the

government is still assessing the situation.
• TAKEAWAY: Western media believe Japanese firms should quit Russian oil and gas projects in line with
overseas peers. While the PM initially suggested this may happen based on a private business decision, his
comment was disingenuous. When he spoke directly to the press, his comments toned down and didn’t
promise a quick resolution.

• Japan’s investments in Russian oil and gas projects were all done with support and encouragement from the
state. An exit from the Sakhalin projects is not a business-only decision and it’s misleading to assume that
Mitsui’s CEO will be the final authority.

• When considering Japanese ownership structure, it’s clear the state is directly invested alongside private
business and is also a key financial guarantor. For example, the SODECO consortium is half owned by the
state. Some other shareholders like trading house Itochu Corp are private, but others like oil exploration firm
JAPEX are part-owned by the state and controlled by METI and other government structures.

• Even Mitsui & Co, entirely a private company, can’t make a decision on Sakhalin II without also making the
same decision on Arctic LNG 2, a project that has yet to begin production, but which won Japanese state and
financial backing as recently as 2019.

• The current goal of both PM Kishida, METI, and domestic firms is to lie low and hope that pressure on Russia
from other directions distracts from the Japanese oil and gas investments. Just like Europe can’t immediately
ditch Russian gas supply, so Japan can’t easily walk away from Russian oil, gas, and coal. For more details on
Japanese energy imports from Russia, see last week’s Analysis section.

Japan to release 7.5 million barrels of oil reserves as part of global action
(Kyodo News, March 4)
o  Japan will release 7.5 million barrels of oil as part of a coordinated response overseen by
the International Energy Agency (IEA) to stabilize energy markets.

o  METI minister Hagiuda said Japan’s contribution was the second highest of the 31 IEA
members who will release 60 million barrels of oil reserves to counteract high oil prices
brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
o  The U.S. will release 30 million barrels.
o  Japan’s contribution is equivalent to about four days’ domestic consumption; the govt.
will reduce mandatory private-sector oil reserves to 66 days' worth from the current 70

days' worth.
o  Japan will continue to encourage oil-producing nations to increase output.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
PM unenthusiastic about reinstatement of gasoline ‘trigger clause’
(Mainichi Shimbun, March 3)
o  The PM does not support reinstating a gasoline tax relief scheme introduced by the

Democratic party of Japan.
o  The govt. will boost the maximum subsidy to petrochemical companies to ¥25 liter.
o  The PM said he’d ‘consider all options ’in the event that energy prices remained high in
the long-term, suggesting there might be reinstatement of tax relief.
Reduce oil use says PM Kishida

(Huffpost Japan, March 3)
o  The PM called on the Japanese to reduce usage in response to rising energy prices.
o  Saying that every little bit helps, PM Kishida stressed citizens conserving energy and
reducing oil and gas usage to minimize the impact of high energy prices.



Russian LNG accounts for 11.5% of Japan’s January imports
(Japan NRG, February 28)
•  Japan imported 779,838 tons of LNG from Russia in January, accounting for 11.5% of the total
imports. Chiba’s customs area was the largest delivery destination, followed by Sakai and
Hokkaido. Separately, METI said Japan’s stocks of LNG stood at 1.8 million tons as of Feb. 27,
down from 1.82 million tons a week ago. This was lower than 2.3 million tons a year ago and the

four-year average of 1.98 million tons.

JERA says SWIFT ban won’t affect Russian LNG imports
(S&P Global, Feb. 28)
•  JERA, Japan’s biggest LNG buyer, relies on Russia for 10% of its supply. The company doesn’t expect
problems in receiving LNG from Sakhalin-2 because its operating company and the bank that services the

trade are not Russian entities.
•  Output is not affected at this time.
•  Most of Japan’s Russian LNG comes under long-term contracts from Sakhalin-2.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japanese utilities hunt for alternative LNG sources beyond Russia
(Nikkei Asia, March 4)

o  Japanese utilities and trading companies seek alternative ways to procure LNG to make
up for an interruption in shipments from Russia.
o  It’s hard to find new sources since the global market is tight, but Japanese firms also
trade about 10 million tons of LNG abroad each year, and could divert it to the domestic
market or use swap trades. That could cut the cost of cargo transport, helping both sides
of the swap.
o  Other options include turning to the spot market.

o  Hiroshima Gas is one of the most dependent Japanese firms on Russian LNG, securing
half of its purchases from the country under long-term deals. Russia also provides about

Toshiba, Tohoku University develop EV motor magnet with less neodymium rare earth
(Company statement, March 1)
•  Toshiba and Tohoku University developed a bonded magnet that reduces neodymium rare earth
consumption to half, replacing it with samarium, another type of rare earth more abundantly

supplied. Bonded magnets are used for hybrid and electric vehicles.
•  The research team succeeded in producing a powerful magnetic alloy that’s only 6% samarium. By
comparison, neodymium alloys contain 13% neodymium.
•  Magnets made from the new alloy are more resistant to heating than those made from traditional

Gas Markets in Turmoil Mean
Second Thoughts Over “Carbon-Neutral” LNG

As the war in Ukraine further pounds natural gas markets already facing upheaval and
soaring prices, major industry players now have to grapple with a wide array of issues
in order to bring order and calm to the sector.

One of those issues in Japan is the future of “carbon-neutral” LNG (CN-LNG), a
product that offers both the molecules and credits that claim to offset the emissions
from the fuel. After taking off a year ago with sales of CN-LNG to Tokyo Gas, the
niche sector has quickly expanded to involve over 40 gas utilities in Japan.

That momentum is now slowing, however, as higher LNG prices eat into company
budgets for the CN premiums. It was true even before recent sanctions linked to the
war cast doubt on the viability of some energy transactions.

The war in Ukraine is starting to reshape energy markets and the CN-LNG sector,
which was created quickly in just about a year, may now need to take a pause and
reflect. Japan’s government and businesses need time to analyze CN-LNG standards
and framework, which have lacked a common meeting point not only domestically but
globally.

Whether the CN-LNG sector takes stock and rebuilds, or disappears just as quickly,
will depend on several key issues.


Required resolutions
For the CN-LNG product offering to have wider credibility, several basic tenets of its
business need to be resolved.

The most important one is probably the value and credibility of the carbon offsets
system. As of today, Japan’s regulatory framework for GHG reduction is far from
complete. The country has yet to launch a system that verifies carbon credit quality, or
a national carbon pricing and trading scheme.

The Japan Gas Association has launched studies on CN-LNG, aiming to set up
guidelines to clarify product definition, requirements and approach to quantifying
carbon and the credits. In March, METI will release its plan for a national carbon
pricing and trading scheme.

Once the government clarifies how things are measured and logged, it will be up to
the CN-LNG marketplace to embed its activities within the Japanese government
emissions system. The Carbon Neutral LNG Buyers Alliance wants (and needs) to
certify voluntary credits used as emission cuts in official GHG filings to the Japanese
government.

Once the rules for the creation and registration of credits are in place, buyers said
they will also ask for more transparency around the various CN-LNG offerings, with the

level of information delivered by sellers today varying greatly.


Japan’s CN-LNG market overview
Just one year ago, only Tokyo Gas was supplying CN-LNG to domestic end-users.
That changed in August 2021 when Malaysia’s Petronas delivered CN-LNG to Shikoku
Electric. Later in the year, it signed a supply agreement with Hiroshima Gas.

By the end of 2021, the Japan Gas Association reported that around 40 out of 197
gas utilities nationwide had plans for CN-LNG. This proves there’s strong interest
among end-users since many have embraced 2050 carbon neutrality goals, but either
cannot turn to or cannot afford to access renewable energy.

Currently, Japan’s CN-LNG supplies come from the following sources — Shell,
Malaysia’s Petronas, Brunei LNG, Mitsubishi Group’s Diamond Gas International,
Mitsui & Co., INPEX, and oil refiner ENEOS. Then there’s JAPEX, an upstream oil and
gas firm that buys CN-LNG from Diamond Gas International and resells it to city gas
utilities. It plans to launch its own CN-LNG product based on its own domestic gas
production volumes and access to voluntary credits.

Where companies source credits
How are voluntary carbon offset credits used to offset GHG emissions? Let’s take a
look at oil and gas firm INPEX. It’s fully self-sufficient in offset credits earned from its
investment in the Indonesian Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project that could
generate 5 million tons of carbon offsets in 2021 to 2025. Similarly, ENEOS generates
carbon credits from forest projects in Indonesia.

Tokyo Gas mixes carbon credits. Shell’s voluntary credits are used to offset gas
supplied to Yakult, Sakai Chemical Industry and others. Tokyo Gas uses its own credits
for some users, while CN-LNG to Saibu Gas utilizes credits that Tokyo Gas sources
from third parties. Mitsubishi and Mitsui source credits based on various client needs.

The large gas operators that own LNG tanks — Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas, and
Hokuriku Lnes, a gas arm of Hokuriku Electric — directly import CN-LNG for resale to

other city gas operators, as well as to end-users. Currently, there are 23 smaller
utilities that started to supply end-users, or plan to start supplies this year.

The Japan Gas Association estimates that if 2 billion m3, or 5% of Japan’s city gas
demand, were carbon neutral, then carbon credits of 5 million tons would be needed.


Hot market, but confusion abounds
The Japan Gas Association said there were 107 CN-LNG end-users as of Dec. 31, and
64 were manufacturers. Interest is strong in industry-intensive Tokyo, Nagoya and
Osaka areas, while less in areas with fewer listed companies.

One end-user in the Kanto region said his company sought to increase the volume of
CN-LNG but was told it wasn’t possible to do so under the same terms. “We signed
up to CN-LNG because renewable power wasn’t so available. One year later, it’s the
other way around,” he said.

On the other hand, a utility in northwest Japan said that only one end-user signed up
in the first three months of service. Another company limited the use of CN-LNG to
just one out of seven plants, because management wants to see how the service
develops first and to monitor changes in GHG reporting regulations.

End-users were also required to make efforts to clarify the terms of CN-LNG products
and services, since the Japanese context is different from overseas. The scope of CN-
LNG offered in Japan includes drilling, production, liquefaction, storage, shipping,
regasification, gas transmission, storage, and end use.

A Japan NRG survey showed that while INPEX and Tokyo Gas were transparent about
where their credits come from, others did not disclose details to the public. Some
Japanese gas utilities confirmed that, in reality, CN-LNG may not cover the end-user
emissions from gas consumption, and they may need to source additional offset
credits to completely offset either GHG or just carbon.

The subtle differences in the CN-LNG offerings confused end-users, prompting the
Japan Gas Association to start writing guidelines on what comprises CN-LNG.


Regulatory challenges
A lack of regulatory visibility is also a problem. Utilities say that end-users have needs
that are too varied, from cutting overall GHGs throughout the Scope III supply chain
to proof that they are taking some kind of green measures to show to shareholders.

Companies report annual carbon emissions to METI, via industry associations, on a
voluntary basis. There is no penalty if they fail to report.

The MoE requires companies with over 1,500 kiloliters/ year of energy consumption to
file GHG emission reports every July. Companies emitting over 3,000 CO2 equivalent
tons/year of GHGs must also report. There are fines for failing to report, as well as for
fraudulent reporting of such emissions.

Presently, voluntary credits for CN-LNG can’t be used for filings to the government.
However, J-Credits can be used. According to a METI study, overseas voluntary
credits typically trade at $1-5/ ton, and the local J-credits at $14-18/ ton.

METI, taking note of the increase in the variety of players in the offset credit market,
has defined four regulatory frameworks that need to be established immediately:

●  A trading platform, such as an exchange
●  Transparency of offset credit pricing
●  Consumer-supplier matching mechanisms
●  Quality assurance for the credits

This month, a METI panel is expected to release a proposal on the launch of a
national carbon exchange. Trial runs are scheduled for fall of 2022, and a formal
launch in April 2023. The roadmaps for the three other frameworks remain unclear.

If the government and industry can work together to establish these standards and
measures, then the CN-LNG system has a good chance to be further implemented
throughout Japan’s gas sector.

Japan Accelerates Geothermal Capacity Rollout
at Home and Abroad, but Project Size Frustrates

Japan’s government has recently drawn a clearer blueprint for geothermal, the
country’s promising yet largely untapped renewable energy source. The end goal is to
drive private companies to expand business at home and abroad. With the right
policies and state support, Japan has the potential to become a global leader in
geothermal.

Since the Fukushima disaster, the number of Japan’s geothermal facilities have
quadrupled to over 90, but many sites are mini-sized. While statistics show installed
geothermal capacity in Japan remains at a meager 481 MW, the ambition is to grow it
to 1.55 GW, which is roughly 1% of the country’s total power needs by 2030.

Even if Japan reaches that goal for geothermal, it would still be just the beginning for
the industry. Research shows the country has potential for at least 23.5 GW of
geothermal capacity. If Japan could even reach 25% of that amount, it would easily be
the world leader. To put the matter in context, total global capacity is 16.4 GW.
Currently, the world’s top geothermal energy producer is the U.S. with installed
capacity of 3.71 GW, followed by Indonesia with 2.13 GW.


Clearer government vision
Investment risk and lack of large-scale facilities constitute the main obstacle and
challenge to growing geothermal capacity, which in general is an arduous process. On
average, global geothermal growth for 2022-2032 will be a sluggish 5%. Compare
that to an approximate 15% growth in wind power capacity in 2020 alone, according
to the Global Wind Energy Council.

Japan’s latest Basic Energy Plan, unveiled in October 2021, offers hope. As a
reflection of former Prime Minister Suga administration’s enthusiasm for renewable
energy, the Plan pays more attention to geothermal with a variety of new policy
directions. Here are some main points:

o JOGMEC will survey 30 sites, mainly in national parks where about 80% of geothermal resources lie
underneath the ground, and share survey data with businesses. Only five sites, mostly outside national
parks, have so far been surveyed. JOGMEC will hand over drilled wells to businesses if requested, to
further reduce risks and costs.

o Review laws and regulations, including the Natural Parks Act, the Hot Springs Act, and the Forest Act.
Also, to ensure smooth coordination between business operators and local communities.

o Develop hydrothermal resources deeper (about 5 km) underground compared to those used in
conventional geothermal power generation. This could hopefully scale up each facility’s size.




20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o Reaffirm the !Geothermal Development Acceleration Plan” announced by the MoE in April 2021. The
ministry pledged to shorten the lead time by up to two years, for a total of eight years, and double
the number of geothermal power generation facilities nationwide by 2030.

o Make a push for geothermal resource surveys and power generation projects in oversea volcanic belts
similar to Japan’s. Also, gain knowledge, experience, and insights to be applied to the exploration
and development of geothermal resources at home.


Spending plans
According to one study, the cost of building and operating a geothermal power plant
in Japan is ¥10-¥18 per KW (excluding tax), which is two to three times higher than in
the U.S. and New Zealand. In Japan, it costs around ¥500 million to drill a geothermal
well, but without digging it’s impossible to know whether hot water will come out. The
success rate is around 30%. Therefore, improving the accuracy of potential resource
mapping is a top priority.

In terms of public investment, METI has included ¥18.3 billion for geothermal
development in its FY2022 budget request, an increase of 60% from the previous
year, when ¥11 billion was secured.

As Japan’s first 10 MW-plus geothermal project in 23 years, the 46 MW double flash
Wasabizawa Geothermal Power Plant opened in Akita Prefecture in May 2019. This
will be followed by the 15 MW Appi Plant in Iwate Prefecture in 2024, and the 15 MW
Katatsumuriyama Plant in Akita Prefecture in 2025, and the 15 MW Kijiyama Plant in
Akita Prefecture in 2029. No other large-scale geothermal projects are on the horizon,
however.

Meanwhile, as for mid-sized plants, 6.5 MW and 2 MW facilities are scheduled to be
operational in Hokkaido and Kumamoto prefectures this year. Based on this reality,
the Japan Geothermal Association requested the government in October 2021 to
maintain the FIT price for geothermal power, and pass the Geothermal Power Act
that’s harmonious with the Hot Spring Act.


Private investments up
In geothermal, Japanese trade houses are signing engineering, procurement and
construction contracts with overseas companies and accumulating know-how. Toyota
Tsusho has an order for the Olkaria geothermal plant in Kenya, with a maximum
output of 280 MW, one of the world’s biggest.

Itochu and Kyushu Electric, are participating in a 330 MW geothermal project in North
Sumatra, Indonesia. In addition, a 98 MW geothermal power plant in South Sumatra,
in which Marubeni and Tohoku Electric are participating, started operation in
December.

Meanwhile, JAPEX will set up a new division dedicated to geothermal, and Osaka Gas
will invest ¥120 billion in renewable energy projects over three years from fiscal 2021,
including geothermal. In April 2021, Kyushu Electric said it would invest ¥250 billion in
geothermal power and other renewables over five years from FY2021.

Construction companies are also rushing into the industry. In July 2021, Obayashi
Corporation built a geothermal power facility as well as a hydrogen production
demonstration plant in Kokonoe Town, Oita Prefecture. The hydrogen has been
shipped as fuel for marine fuel cell systems and Toyota's hydrogen-powered racing
cars. This is the first demonstration project in Japan to supply hydrogen produced by
geothermal power.

In November 2021, Shimizu Corporation started the construction of a demonstration
plant to produce hydrogen using electricity from geothermal power in the same town.
Likewise, Takenaka Corporation announced in April 2021 that it had entered into a
geothermal power generation project in Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture.


Global demand
Plans are underway to establish a new financial support system to make it easier for
companies to enter the geothermal business overseas, by possibly amending the
JOGMEC Act. Similarly, Japan’s Foreign Ministry is reportedly preparing to create
new projects for FY2022 to support developing countries, with geothermal and other
renewable energy projects in mind.

INPEX issued ¥10 billion in green bonds in October 2021 to develop geothermal
power plants and other projects in Japan and abroad. The oil firm said in December
that it had participated in the Muara Laboh Geothermal Power Generation project in
West Sumatra, Indonesia. The company added in February that it would invest up to
¥1 trillion in decarbonization-related projects, including geothermal power
generation, by 2030.

At the same time, global demand for turbines has soared, creating an opportunity for
Japanese manufacturers. Toshiba Energy Systems has delivered turbines to
geothermal power plants in 11 countries around the world. Compared with other
overseas manufacturers, Toshiba’s turbines can withstand long-term specifications
without losing output.

The company plans to further expand its turbine business in Indonesia and East Africa,
and wants to add larger and smaller turbines to its lineup. Also, MHI has delivered
geothermal turbines to 13 countries, and in a pleasant surprise, its market share in
Iceland has reached 55%.

Finally, the development of next-gen geothermal technology is accelerating. Taisei
Corporation, together with the Geothermal Energy Research & Development Co., is
working on generating electricity by turning turbines with high-temperature CO2
instead of water. On-site demonstrations will begin in 2026, and hopefully put the
technology to practical use from 2036.

Given its ample geothermal potential, Japan would miss a great opportunity to
expand its renewables base if it doesn’t take more determined action on this front.
The interest from top government and business is there. However, a lack of
bureaucratic resources allotted to developing geothermal capacity is also visible,
mostly because it lacks the scalability of solar and wind.

Still, with Japan hard pressed to meet net-zero goals by 2030, every option has to be
explored and every little bit counts.

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Wind power
Spain's Acciona Energía said construction of its planned 923 MW MacIntyre wind farm
in Queensland was approved. Once built, the project will be 70% owned by Acciona,
with 30% held by Ark Energy, a subsidiary of Korea Zinc whose goal is to decarbonize
the group’s energy supply.

Germany/ Wind and solar
The Economy Ministry plans to triple new onshore wind and solar facilities, and wants
to accelerate the country’s goal to generate all electricity from renewables by 2035,
instead of 2050. Germany will diversify energy sources away from Russia, on whom it
relies for over half of its natural gas.

Green investment
Macquarie’s Green Investment Group announced plans to launch an offshore wind
business – Corio Generation. It will commence operations in April 2022, with a project
pipeline of over 15 GW – one of the world's largest.

India/ Solar power
India added more than 10 GW of solar PV in 2021, reaching cumulative installed solar
capacity of 49 GW, according to Mercom India Research. The 10 GW of new capacity
made in 2021 represented a 210% increase YoY.
Pakistan/ Gas
During his trip to Moscow just hours after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, PM Imran
Khan signed a deal to import about 2 million tons of wheat and buy natural gas. “We
signed agreements to import natural gas because Pakistan's own gas reserves are
depleting," Khan said.

Russia/ Energy divestments
In the wake of the Russian invasion, Shell will end its partnership with Gazprom, selling
a 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-II oil and gas project. BP will end relations with Rosneft,
which accounts for half of BP’s oil and gas reserves, and a third of its production.
ExxonMobil will stop operating its Sakhalin-I oil and gas project, and halt new
investments in Russia. Also, Norway’s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund will divest its
Russian assets.

Saudi Arabia/ Battery storage
A consortium composed of ACWA Power, SPIC Huanghe Hydropower Development
and Saudi Tabreed Cooling raised $1.3 billion to invest in infrastructure for the world's
largest off-grid battery energy storage system, with capacity of 1.3 GWh.

Ukraine/ Nuclear power
After armed hostilities between Russian and Ukrainian troops ignited a fire on the
premises, the Russian army took the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is
Europe’s largest. It's located in central Ukraine in the city of Enerhodar on the banks
of the Dnieper River.

U.S./ Fossil fuel divestment
Insurance company AIG will stop insuring and investing in companies that derive more
than 30% of revenue from coal-fired power, thermal coal mines or oil sands projects.
AIG plans to achieve net-zero emissions across its global underwriting and investment
portfolios by 2050.

U.S./ Oil and gas
Republicans are urging President Biden to increase domestic oil and gas production,
and to wean the nation and allies off Russian oil. The U.S. gets 5% to 10% of its crude
oil and refined products from Russia. Sanctions imposed on Russia so far don’t include
oil and gas exports.

U.S./ Solar power
Solar power generation rose by 25.2% in 2021, making it the country’s fastest-growing
source of electricity; renewables accounted for 21% of all electricity and in 2022 will
surpass coal in terms of total production. For 2022, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration expects 21.8 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity and 4.4 GW of small-
scale solar capacity to come online. It also predicts 7.6 GW of new wind capacity to
come online.
