NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


Grid operators offer upgrade plans to meet 9 GW of new data center capacity

(Government statement, May 29)
•  CONTEXT: METI and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) held their third
“Watt-Bit” working group meeting to align power grid infrastructure with the rapidly expanding data
center (DC) sector.
•  The ministries and officials from TEPCO Power Grid and the Japan Data Center Council focused on
locations for DCs, which the group says needs an additional 6 to 9 GW of power capacity by 2040.
•  TEPCO Power Grid outlined a phased response:
o  Short term (to 2030): focus on attracting DCs to areas with existing grid capacity –
particularly in Chiba and Tochigi prefs, which together offer about 5 GW of spare capacity.
o  Medium-term (to 2035): connect small-scale DCs (under 2 MW) to local distribution
substations. This could unlock 1 to 1.5 GW of capacity in eastern Japan, assuming efficient
coordination and equipment upgrades.
o  Long-term (to 2040): build two to three new high-voltage (500/154 kV) substations in
DC-heavy zones, along with land acquisition to support grid-side investment in high-
demand areas.
•  Authorities raised concern about developers splitting up large DC projects (over 2 MW) into smaller
units to avoid grid fees and noted the need to maintain grid fairness.
• TAKEAWAY: A full discussion of the Watt-Bit initiative was published in the Japan NRG Analysis section on May
19, 2025. This is one of the most urgent initiatives at the moment and policy discussions are moving quickly. We
expect further details on locations and capacity forecasts to be made during the summer. A summary of policy
recommendations is likely to be released after the next working group meeting.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Vena Group seeks to drive green AI data center expansion
(Company statement, May 28)
o  Singapore-based Vena Energy, a renewables developer, set up a new data center subsidiary,
Vena Nexus, and plans similar development in Japan. The focus is on AI-driven data centers
powered by renewable energy.
o  In February, Vena Energy partnered with Tokyo-based startup Quantum Mesh to set up
small-scale renewables-powered data centers.
o  This highlights Japan’s growing role in combining renewables and advanced data
infrastructure amid rising demand from AI and digital services.
o  Vena Energy also aims to expand similar projects across Asia-Pacific, including Thailand,

South Korea, and Australia.


METI seeks next LTDA rounds with stricter rules for BESS, LNG focus

(Government statement, May 28)
•  METI/ ANRE proposed keeping the third round capacity of the Long-term Decarbonized Power
Sources Auction at the level of the previous one: 5 GW.
•  Still, key changes include stricter criteria for batteries (BESS), cutbacks in hydrogen/ ammonia and
nuclear upgrade capacity, and focus on LNG for power supply.
Key points:
•  Battery Storage & Long-duration Storage (LDES):
o  Total cap for storage (batteries + pumped hydro + LDES): 800 MW*

3



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Battery projects must have a discharge duration of at least six hours.
o  Projects with three to six hour duration are implemented outside the auction, so will not be
targeted.
o  The 800 MW* is split into two categories:
▪  Pumped hydro refurbishment & Li-ion batteries: 400 MW
▪  New pumped hydro, non-lithium batteries & LDES: 400 MW
This is a drop from previous rounds, where auctioned capacity exceeded the set cap.
•  Hydrogen/ ammonia & CCS-fitted thermal power:
o  Upper limit: 500 MW
o  Price ceiling per kW: ¥134,000 – ¥795,000 (avg: /~¥400,000)
o  This is about twice the ceiling price for other sources (¥200,000/ kW).
o  The cap was reduced from 1 GW in the previous round to ease public burden.
•  Existing nuclear safety upgrades:
o  New cap: 1.5 GW (down from 2 GW)
o  The last round saw 3.15 GW awarded, exceeding the limit.
•  LNG-Fired Power (Exclusive use):
o  Cap set a 2.93 GW (including 2 GW originally planned + 930 MW unallocated from the
previous round)
o  Future auctions (from FY2026) may continue to target 2 to 3 GW to ensure stable supply

amid plant retirements and demand growth.
• TAKEAWAY: The changes, especially a tighter scope for batteries and requirements than in earlier rounds,
showcase much stricter rules on batteries, apparently in response to growing interest from developers and a way
to secure more reliant technology. The draft also shows a continued strong preference for LNG, despite initial
ministry claims that it’s a transitional power source. The perceived reliability of LNG generation is one of the
reasons pushing its extended usage.



ANRE proposes funding method for large-scale grid development
(Government statement, May 23)
•  ANRE wants a system to allow part of the costs for large-scale power grid development to be
recovered through wheeling charges even before operations begin.
•  This would ease cash flow issues for TSOs during long construction periods and avoid investment
delays for inter-regional connections and large-scale internal grids.
•  ANRE is also considering revising how construction-phase assets are treated in calculating business
returns, as rising interest rates increase funding costs.
•  CONTEXT: The 7th Basic Energy Plan outlines frameworks to promote development of regional grids
and measures to facilitate financing for large-scale interregional power connections. Ensuring stable
electricity supply while expanding renewable energy requires enhanced grid development.



Upper House passes GX promo amendment, emissions trading participation mandatory

(Denki Shimbun, May 29)
•  The Upper House passed the amended GX Promotion Law, formalizing a national carbon emissions
trading scheme (ETS).
•  Starting in FY2027, companies emitting over 100,000 tons of CO2 will have to join the ETS; this will
impact about 400 major companies in steel, power, and chemicals.
•  They’ll have to calculate annual CO2 emissions and offset with emission allowances.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
GX League to expand its framework to retail and other sectors
(Denki Shimbun, May 26)
o  METI seeks to revise the structure of the GX League, which involves over 700 companies
mostly from manufacturing, energy, and transport.
o  The goal is to shift focus from individual company emissions to full supply chain (Scope 3)
CO2 reductions.



NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS



Guarantee proposed for ¥1.8 trillion Hokkaido-Honshu subsea power cable
(Nikkei, May 29)
•  The govt is considering public debt guarantees to build a subsea power cable connecting Hokkaido
and Honshu; total cost is estimated at ¥1.5 to ¥1.8 trillion.
•  The cable aims to link Hokkaido’s abundant renewable energy resources (wind, solar) with the high-
demand Honshu region, promoting wider renewable energy use and more stable power supply.
•  Overseen by the national grid operator, the project will be awarded by March 2026, with
construction taking six to 10 years.
•  TEPCO Power Grid leads the consortium bidding on the project, but requests govt-backed debt
guarantees to attract private financing.
•  The Basic Energy Plan emphasizes such measures to facilitate financing for large energy
infrastructure projects.
•  Enhanced interregional power transmission supports Japan’s target to increase renewable energy to
50% by 2040.
•  CONTEXT: International precedents exist, such as Germany-Norway subsea cables backed partly by
state loans or guarantees.
• TAKEAWAY: The Hokkaido-Honshu cable project reflects a critical turning point for Japan’s energy transition.
While debt guarantees are a positive step, they are not sufficient on their own. Given the scale and the long
construction timeline, more proactive and direct public financing will also be needed. To speed up grid upgrades
to improve the transmission network, the govt needs to attract private investment, which proved essential in
large-scale interconnection infrastructure like NordLink connecting Germany and Norway.




Japan considers inflation-linked reforms to transmission fee rules
(Government statement, May 29)
•  The power & gas regulator, EGC, seeks inflation adjustment to the "revenue cap" system that
governs how transmission and distribution (T&D) companies recover costs; the goal is to reflect
rising prices and labor costs.
•  Under current rules, utilities’ revenue ceilings are based on pre-approved expenses; however, recent
inflation has driven actual costs higher, prompting calls to refine calculation methods for both
current and future regulatory periods.
•  The proposal would introduce indicators – such as govt inflation forecasts and labor cost indices – to
set revenue limits, with adjustments made retroactively if actual inflation deviates from projections.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  While reforms are slated for what is termed the ‘second regulatory period’ (FY2028–32), the govt is
also weighing whether to apply temporary measures to the current period (FY2023–27), where cost
pressures are already materializing.
•  For FY2023, for example, utilities reported cost increases of about ¥1.5 trillion that can be
attributed to inflation, but only about ¥495 billion of this qualifies under the current revenue cap’s
expense-based criteria.
•  EGC stresses that any adjustments must be transparent and fair to consumers, who are increasingly
sensitive to power price hikes.

ANRE holds off on mandatory supply system in balancing market

(Government statement, May 28)
•  ANRE will not introduce institutional measures that would partially mandate the supply of power
sources to the balancing market, originally planned for April 2026.
•  For now, market procurement will proceed by utilizing available power sources and discretionary
contracts for pumped storage, among others.
•  In FY2026, the trading time for all products is scheduled to be shortened from 3 hours to 30
minutes per block, and weekly products are to shift to day-ahead trading.
•  Given the multiple planned system upgrades, it’s believed that proceeding as originally planned
could disrupt markets.
•  CONTEXT: Since trading began in the balancing market in FY2021, there’ve been frequent shortfalls in
meeting solicitation volume, leading to a sharp rise in procurement prices. This impacts both the
financial stability of TSOs, who bear the cost of securing balancing capacity, and the burden on
consumers.

Japan’s Resource Diplomacy Evolves Into Market Architecture
Japan’s natural resource diplomacy is no longer just about shielding domestic industries
from supply shocks. Rather, it’s now actively co-architecting markets, shaping which
technologies scale and where companies place their bets.

After decades of debating new ways to access critical minerals, Japan is starting to wield
its institutional tools more assertively – making direct investments, underwriting high-
risk ventures, and expanding state finance to influence global supply chains. This marks
a shift from strategic intent to operational action.

Two recent deals illustrate this. JOGMEC backed a rare earth refinery in France – its first
support for a stand-alone overseas processing facility. Meanwhile, the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) committed $466 million to Chile’s state copper giant,
Codelco, as part of a larger co-financing package to secure supplies for Japanese firms.
Such moves go beyond raw material access. They reflect Tokyo’s recognition that
mineral security today means engaging across the value chain. What began in the 2010s
as risk mitigation has matured into a state-enabled resource diplomacy ecosystem – one
suited for an era of geopolitical fragmentation and technological chokepoints.

Seen this way, Japan’s resource push is not just about extraction, but systems-building.
It favours selective interdependence and strategic sovereignty without full decoupling
from China. For foreign and domestic firms alike, this signals a more activist Japanese
industrial policy – full of opportunity, but governed on tighter terms.

From minerals to strategy
Japan’s status as a high-tech manufacturer has long demanded a strategic approach to
mineral security. Applications in batteries, solar panels, wind turbines and hydrogen
electrolyzers have only heightened this need, linking mineral inputs to clean energy and
industrial goals.
Anchored by METI’s 35-item critical minerals list, which was updated in 2024 to include
uranium, Japan’s mineral diplomacy now underpins the broader Green and Digital
Transformation strategies (ie GX and DX). These aim to mobilize ¥150 trillion in public–
private investment for net zero, while upgrading Japan’s digital and industrial base.

The alignment of climate, digital, and industrial goals reframes minerals as strategic
enablers of techno-industrial competitiveness. This evolution occurs amid escalating
supply chain politics with Washington’s tariffs and Beijing’s export curbs casting a long
shadow on economic planning.
Japan’s own 2010 rare earths shock – when China suspended exports during a maritime
dispute – triggered a decade of diversification and long-term offtakes, much of it led by
the then-named Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, which in 2022 was
renamed Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security to reflect a renewed focus.

Today, JOGMEC and JBIC – Japan’s chief state-backed financial tools – have seen their
mandates expand accordingly. Both are now central to Japan’s economic security
strategy, taking on roles well beyond their historical remits.

Finance arms of mineral strategy
JOGMEC’s legal cap on overseas equity stakes was lifted from 50% to 75% in 2022,
alongside new authorization to issue debt guarantees. That has allowed it to chase
riskier, priority projects – particularly in lithium, cobalt and rare earths. The
organization spans the full development cycle from exploration to production, with
government-backed insurance and resource diplomacy to match.
Between 2004 and 2020, JOGMEC participated in more than 100 projects, deploying
over $600 million across 15 countries. Its stockpiling policy was also revised in 2020,
allowing it to release or acquire reserves in response to supply shocks, with terms kept
confidential to avoid market disruption.

JBIC, meanwhile, repositioned itself as more than just a financier of Japanese firms
overseas. Its latest business plan (FY2024–26) highlights carbon neutrality,
semiconductor resilience and global supply chain robustness. JBIC now backs clean tech,
digital infrastructure, and even global startups – supporting both large corporates and
export-focused SMEs. Its toolkit includes debt, equity and bilateral project finance.
The pair have complementary roles: JOGMEC absorbs upstream risk; JBIC builds out the
midstream and downstream. Together, they underpin Japan’s broader policy framework,
shaped by the 2022 Economic Security Promotion Act. This legislation formalized cross-
ministry coordination and introduced “specified important materials,” giving the state
broader authority to intervene in strategic supply chains.

These tools are now deployed alongside credit lines, industrial subsidies, and foreign aid
– designed not only to build resilience, but to exert influence over infrastructure,
technologies, and commercial norms.

JBIC’s role in global supply chain reconstruction



















Source: JBIC

From access to architecture
Japan’s approach has evolved from mineral access to ecosystem design. This shift is
evident in its geographically tiered strategy, outlined in the GX Diplomacy Guidelines.
Stable countries like Australia and Canada receive direct investment. Chile, Peru, and
the Philippines are targeted via public–private dialogues. Higher-risk markets,
particularly in Africa, are accessed through trilateral or multilateral initiatives with
allies.
Bilateral and multilateral partnerships are multiplying. A 2023 mineral supply chain
agreement with the U.S. expanded into a pact with South Korea covering
semiconductors and critical minerals. Japan is investing in mineral processing centers in
Vietnam and co-developing nickel value chains in the Philippines. Ties with France and
the UK are deepening, and joint ventures in Africa are being negotiated.

Japan’s traditional commodity procurement agents, the trading houses, are also active.
Sumitomo Corp has worked to procure rare earth elements in Kazakhstan and Vietnam,
and in February 2023 signed an exclusive rare earths deal for Japan with MP Materials.
In a quid pro quo, Japan’s overseas aid went to port infrastructure in Madagascar to
facilitate nickel extraction. Meanwhile, Japan remains a founding member of the
Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) and the Quad’s Critical Minerals Working Group –
efforts that seek to set global standards for ESG, traceability, and sustainable mining.

At the G7 in Hiroshima in 2023, Japan pushed through a Five-Point Plan for Critical
Mineral Security, backed by ¥200 billion in commitments. Regional frameworks like the
Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) and the Asia Energy Transition Initiative (AETI)
embed mineral supply into broader decarbonization efforts.
The result is a web of projects, institutions and rules – what might be called curated
interdependence. Japan is building trust-based supply chain ecosystems, while limiting
exposure to volatility and techno-nationalist blocs. The real strategic asset is no longer
just the mineral, but the platform, the rules, and the alliances that govern it.

Signals to business
For companies, Japan’s resource diplomacy introduces a new landscape of signals and
incentives. Domestic firms in strategic sectors are likely to benefit from subsidies,
insurance, and joint ventures, especially where market risks are high or technologies
remain pre-commercial.
Through METI’s ¥2 trillion Green Innovation Fund, administered by NEDO, Japan is
bankrolling early-stage projects such as Sumitomo Chemical and JERA’s lithium-ion
battery reuse process. The Critical Minerals Subsidy Scheme overseen by JOGMEC
covers up to half of eligible costs for approved ventures.

Foreign firms face a different dynamic. They may encounter more scrutiny – or
encouragement – to form partnerships with Japanese counterparts. This is not
protectionism as much as it is market design. Japan wants control over how and where
risk is sourced, and where value accumulates.
This design extends overseas. State funding is increasingly tied to JVs in third-country
markets. In Australia, JBIC backed Japanese investments in Lynas, helping it become the
first commercial producer of heavy rare earths outside China. The Japan–France Rare
Earth Corp, a public-private partnership between JOGMEC, Iwatani, and France’s
Caremag, is building a rare earth separation facility in France that could eventually meet
a fifth of Japan’s demand for certain oxides like dysprosium and terbium.

Japan’s involvement is not just financial. It includes diplomatic facilitation and demand-
side guarantees to stabilise investor expectations – ensuring private capital flows into
projects aligned with national priorities.

Where technologies are promising but risky, the state is offering incentives to co-develop
and de-risk them – shaping entire ecosystems, not just single ventures. The goal is to
embed innovation within Japan’s supply chains, not outsource it.
Foreign investors, especially those in projects with environmental or social footprints,
will need to interpret where Japan signals openness – and where it expects tighter
alignment on ESG, data sharing, or strategic autonomy. Japanese firms themselves are
being pushed to meet higher standards, disclose more, and demonstrate compliance.

This may raise long-term costs, but it also offers reputational rewards in a global market
hungry for verified, responsibly sourced minerals.

A platform strategy
Ultimately, Japan is betting on interdependence – not through laissez-faire openness,
but rather through curated collaboration. From lithium mines to rare earth refineries,
from trading house diplomacy to bilateral rulemaking, Tokyo is building a system that
mixes industrial logic with statecraft.
Industries tied to clean energy, digital infrastructure, and critical materials will
increasingly find themselves nested within these state-backed ecosystems – sheltered
from certain market risks, but subject to more oversight. That duality is what makes
Japan’s new resource diplomacy not just a geopolitical hedge, but a market-shaping
force.

ANALYSIS

BY FILIPPO PEDRETTI
Japanese SMRs Move Forward but Not in Japan

Japanese firms are developing Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), nuclear units that are
touted as the sector’s next phase and best bet to further spread nuclear power across the
globe, especially to cash-strapped countries. Most significant developments by Japanese
companies, however, are taking place outside of the country.
With a capacity of under 300 MW, SMRs comprises diverse kinds of technologies,
including conventional reactors such as BWRs/PWRs and experimental ones. They are
modular, meaning the components can be mass-produced and assembled on site.

Hyped as a game changer for the nuclear industry, the SMR is still an underdeveloped
technology, with only Russia and China having commercially operable reactors. In April,
however, the technology took a big step forward in G7 countries, when a project using
GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 secured permission to begin construction in
Canada.
Another Japanese firm is in talks to build an SMR in the U.S. based on Japan’s own
innovative gas-cooling technology. That project is still in the early stages, but it’s already
attracting attention from big energy users, such as data center companies, which are
eager to find solutions to their power hungry business.

Proponents of SMRs hope such projects will pave the way to develop a safer, easier to
deploy nuclear power source that can balance out the rising wave of variable renewable
energy. With Japan’s domestic nuclear sector slow to reemerge, success abroad is seen
as vital to realizing SMRs in a real, commercial setting. A positive track record of SMRs
operating overseas would pave the way to the tech’s introduction in Japan’s home
market.

The model
One of the most advanced and prominent Japanese SMR projects abroad is the BWRX-
300, which is a 300-MWe developed by GEH, a joint venture between U.S.-based GE
Vernova and Hitachi. The model includes components from GEH's Economic Simplified
Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) and Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR).
One of its most attractive features is the passive safety mechanism. Conventional
reactors rely on active cooling systems, but the BWRX-300 can shut down and cool itself
through natural circulation. This is obtained through a system that provides natural
circulation of water to cool the reactor without the need of an active operator. This is
crucial in case of an earthquake or tsunami. In addition, this feature helps to lower
costs.

The first BWRX-300 is already on the path to realization. Last month, Ontario Power
Generation (OPG) secured a permit to build the first one at its Darlington New Nuclear
Project site. This project is slated to become a hub with up to four SMRs, with units 2
through 4 scheduled to begin operations between 2034 and 2036. The max licensed
capacity of the site is 4,800 MW, so in time further reactors may be added.
GEH will provide in-core structures, a control rod drive mechanism, and a control rod
drive hydraulic unit. Japanese suppliers will provide major components, and by doing
so, also help develop human resources in Japan that can specialize in the sector. By
building experience in working with the new reactor model, the company will gain
know-how and expertise for further development of SMRs in Japan.

If successful, the first BWRX-300 will serve as the pathfinder for future SMR
deployments in the province and then across Canada.

Permits and costs
In 2021, OPG selected GEH's predecessor as its technology partner. After preparatory
work such as foundation digging, the permit from the Canadian Nuclear Safety
Commission finally allowed the company to proceed. The licence is valid until the end of
March 31, 2035 and is part of the regulatory oversight to govern the project.

The CNSC's decision followed an extensive two-part public hearing in October 2024 and
then in January 2025. All submissions and perspectives were considered, including those
from local residents, environmental experts, and Indigenous groups.
In 2022, the company applied for the current permit, which pertains to construction
only. Before progressing to reactor operation, the company must secure another permit
for operations. GEH and OPG expect the reactors to start about FY2029 or FY2030 and
to operate for around 65 years.

Costs for the Darlington project could reach $15 billion, including from licensing and
construction to interest on financing. The first SMR unit is forecasted at $4.45 billion,
and related infrastructure costs will be $1.17 billion, for a total of $5.62 billion.

The cost estimates for the second, third, and fourth SMRs are not yet finalized, but OPG
expects each successive unit to be less costly with the fourth unit estimated at $3 billion.

The above figures are much higher than previous GEH’s estimates, which were around
$2,250-2,500/ kW, or $700 million-$750 million for a single 300 MW unit. Such a price
tag made the units competitive with other energy sources, especially thermal ones like
gas.
Still, OPG thinks it can keep the electricity cost to around $0.1088/ kWh. While higher
than the $0.09/ kWh of GEH earlier estimates, according to OPG
this will both be enough to recover the investment and stay
competitive with other sources, especially renewables.

More projects
Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Europe the BWRX-300 is gaining
traction in the UK’s plans for a fleet of SMR facilities. The
government shortlisted three potential SMR technologies, with the
BWRX-300 a contender. The others are from Holtec and Rolls-
Royce. Westinghouse was also on the list, but dropped out in April.
Some SMRs are eschewing the traditional BWR and LWR nuclear
technologies and experimenting with very different systems that
claim to be even safer and more agile.

Recently, Coral Capital invested in ZettaJoule, a Japanese startup
developing an SMR built on a high-temperature gas reactor
(HTGR). The company recently secured follow-on funding led by
Globis Capital Partners, with participation from Archetype
Ventures, HAX, etc.
Unlike reactors relying on water cooling, ZettaJoule’s proposed
design uses helium as a coolant and graphite as a moderator. This
enables the reactor to operate at high temperatures, up to 900°C,
and should also minimize meltdown risks.

ZettaJoule intends to unite Japanese suppliers and international
regulators and investors. The startup is partnering with a U.S.
university to build a demo reactor in Texas by the early 2030s, with
plans for commercial deployment later that decade.

Getting a permit for new technology takes years – five or more. But ZettaJoule’s plan to
have the initial reactor project in the U.S. as a research facility should expedite
permissions to as little as 12-15 months, according to the company.
The permit application should also be helped by the fact that Japan has operated such
tech for decades. And once a research reactor has a track record working in the U.S.,
securing approval for a commercial-scale unit should be easier, according to ZettaJoule.

The startup has assembled an international and experienced team spanning several
disciplines. It is led by an ex-Sumitomo Corp strategist for commercialization with a
former senior Mitsubishi Heavy Industries executive as the deputy CEO. JAEA’s HTGR
pioneers and former nuclear regulators from Canada and the U.S. are among those
managing the technical and policy challenges ZettaJoules faces.

The level of seniority among ZettaJoules leaders signals a further change in Japan’s
attitude towards SMRs, whose research was also affected by the negative opinion
towards nuclear power in the wake of Fukushima in 2011.
After the post-Fukushima cold approach towards nuclear power, SMRs included, change
in attitude began also thanks to companies like engineering giants IHI Corp and JGC
Holdings, which took part in the SMR business through investment in the U.S. specialist
NuScale. They made an investment of $20 million and $40 million each. Just a few days
ago, IHI said it completed a prototype wall module for NuScale's SMR plant project in
Romania set to open by 2030. IHI too hopes that it will bring such technology and
related expertise to Japan.

Other Japanese firms reportedly working on SMR projects include Toshiba and MHI.
The latter is believed to be developing a PWR-type SMR unit.

Conclusion
On paper, SMRs promise to be a flexible and cheaper alternative to traditional large-
scale nuclear reactors that often face delays to regulatory hurdles and community
opposition. SMRs could be suitable for powering remote communities and supporting
industrial operations, especially in helping to meet the growing energy demand that is
accompanying the rise of generative AI.
However, G7 nations have not made SMRs a priority. Only Russia and China have
commercial SMR operations, with the former starting in May 2020, and China following
in December 2023. But if technologies such as those promoted by GEH and ZettaJoule
prove themselves commercially viable, this could open the door to a new wave of
enthusiasm for nuclear power, including in Japan.
That’s still a large “if”. An SMR flagship project by Nuscale in the U.S. was recently
cancelled due to an almost doubling of costs to $9.3 billion. And while SMR construction
costs tend to be less than for conventional reactors, SMRs still need to show their
profitability in cost-per-output terms, something difficult given the loss of economy of
scale.

Relying on progress overseas is not the easiest path for Japanese industry, but it may be
their only option at present. Japan’s nuclear regulator remains extremely conservative
and slow to engage in new technology reviews. The government lacks a detailed
strategy or roadmap for SMRs. Aside from a very general timeline, Tokyo energy
planners have on occasion made scattered remarks about the potential to substitute
aging reactors with smaller versions.

The cooler reception to SMRs inside Japan despite momentum for the technology
overseas is in part due to the nuclear sector’s general difficulties at home. Most
politicians are wary of bringing up new nuclear facilities when the majority of the
existing ones have yet to restart. The same is largely true for domestic nuclear plant
operators, which have yet to recoup the vast sums spent on fortifying existing stations to
meet stricter safety standards.
And so it is left to the technologists to forge ahead – overseas. As ever, they will be
judged on how well their projects deliver in terms of cost and time. Industry leaders
know that the road ahead is long and far from simple. Betting on SMRs as a near-term
solution for Japan at this point is little more than wishful thinking.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Asia / Fossil fuels
The Asia Clean Energy Coalition said the region “remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels”, with
over 85% of its energy still sourced from non-renewable sources.
Asia / LNG
Imports of LNG to Asia are stable, on track to reach 22.53 Mt in May, up slightly from 21.89 Mt
in April, according to commodities analysts at Kpler.

Australia / LNG
Viva Energy received an environmental permit for its proposed LNG terminal in Geelong. It will
enable the market in Victoria to connect to supply sources in north Australia.

China / Coal
China is producing more coal than it can consume, resulting in a 42% YoY increase in mine
stockpiles and a 25% annual rise in inventories at northern Bohai area ports.
China / Hydrogen
Oil and gas major Sinopec unveiled a $690 million venture capital fund to support early-stage
hydrogen investments and technologies.

China / Russian gas
Gazprom delivered the first 100 bcm of natural gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline, as part of
contracted volumes exceeding 1 trillion cubic meters. In 2027, Gazprom will start deliveries of
gas to China via a second pipeline - the Far Eastern route.

India / Coal imports
Coal imports decreased 7.9 % in FY2025, totalling 244 Mt. This drop resulted in foreign
exchange savings of about $7.93 billion.
India / Solar and BESS
Sembcorp Industries won a 150 MW solar power project with a 300 MWh BESS, and a 25-yr
PPA with SJVN. The firm now has a total of 6.3 GW renewables capacity across India.

Malaysia / Power generation
ACWA Power agreed with the govt to develop up to 12.5 GW of power generation capacity by
2040. Total investment will reach $10 billion.

Singapore / Carbon credits
Singapore inked a deal with Paraguay on carbon credits cooperation. This is its seventh
partner; others are Papua New Guinea, Ghana, Bhutan, Peru, Chile, and Rwanda.
