NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





METI launches public consultation on low-carbon hydrogen fuels

(Government statement, Aug 7)
•  METI began public consultation on its proposal for low-carbon hydrogen standards and subsidies
to promote supplies. Feedback is open until Sept 11.
•  Hydrogen’s scope for decarbonization includes hydrogen, ammonia (hydrogen and nitrogen),
synthetic fuel and synthetic methane (hydrogen and CO2).
o  Low carbon hydrogen has a GHG footprint measured in CO2 equivalent of 3.4 kg or

below for production of 1 kg of hydrogen;
o  Ammonia is 0.78 kg or below;
o  Synthetic fuel scores a value of 39.8 or less, and the value is calculated by subtracting the
amount of CO2 reused for producing one megajoule of the fuel, from the total CO2
emission throughout its lifecycle;
o  Synthetic methane scores 49.3 or less, following the same calculation method as
synthetic fuel.
•  METI also proposed rules on carbon accounting for hydrogen produced overseas, safety

inspections, draft application forms for subsidies, etc.
•  CONTEXT: The proposed standards supplement the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act that passed
the Diet in June. METI followed the most common international standards for the low-carbon
criteria: European standards for hydrogen and ammonia, and International Standard Organization
(ISO) for synthetic fuel and synthetic methane.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Govt solicits feedback on biodiversity promotion
(Government statement, Aug 6)
o  The govt seeks public feedback on its proposed basic principles on biodiversity following
the enactment of the Regional Biodiversity Promotion Act in April. The feedback period
closes on Sept 4.
o  City, town and village municipalities will be able to define areas which require measures

to promote biodiversity but that fall outside the scope of national parks, forestry and
other protected areas.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kishida cancels Central Asia trip to brace for possible emergencies
(NHK, Aug 9)
o  PM Kishida canceled his trip to Central Asia planned for Aug 9 to 12 in order to focus on

possible earthquake emergencies.
o  CONTEXT: The PM had planned to attend a summit of five Central Asian nations in
Kazakhstan to discuss a wide range of areas, such as the spread of green technologies,
infrastructure development, human resource growth in the fields of IT and governance,
and the expansion of trade.

ANRE seeks feedback on proposed changes to renewables surcharges
(Government statement, Aug 7)
•  ANRE launched a public consultation on its proposal to change the renewables surcharge
collection system. This would also change rules for the existing order in which power sources are

curtailed (“Priority Dispatch Rules”).
•  The surcharge, the source of FIT payments to renewables operators, is automatically added onto
monthly power bills but some (industrial) users were exempted.
•  ANRE proposes to change the exemption rules and new energy conservation reporting
requirements for the exemptions. Feedback is accepted until Sept 11.
•  The govt’s proposal also encourages switching from the FIT to FIP with transition incentives
through several avenues:

o  Prioritize FIT plants for curtailment, which could lead to a drop in energy sales and
reduced income for operators;
o  Exempt FIP projects that use storage batteries from curtailment.
•  CONTEXT: When there’s excess electricity output, that of thermal power plants is reduced first,
and electricity is transferred to regions with a deficit of power. If there’s still excess power, then
renewables generation is suppressed in the order of biomass, solar and wind. Curtailments

reached a record 1.88 TWh in FY2023, and could swell to 2.42 TWh in FY2024.
• TAKEAWAY: By making changes to the “priority dispatch rules”, METI is nudging a further shift from state-
subsidized pricing for renewable energy to market-based pricing. The switch from FIT to FIP has been slow
partly because financing for new projects is easier to secure with a FIT business model. Squeezing the revenue
of FIT-based facilities, however, should even out their cash flow risk profiles with FIP, which (in METI’s eyes)
should motivate more operators to swap FIT for FIP and, in the process, encourage the installation of storage
batteries. For electricity markets, this is also a boon in that more renewable energy volumes should be market-

aligned. While there’s been a surge in standalone battery projects in the last year or so, only a small
percentage of solar developers have so far added onsite storage batteries.




ANRE proposes mandating gas utilities to boost clean fuel supplies
(Government statement, Aug 9)
•  ANRE is studying amendments to the Sophisticated Methods Act to increase the share of biogas

and synthetic methane supplies in city gas.
•  ANRE proposes mandating Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho Gas to raise the share of clean gas
supplies to 5% by 2030.
•  After 2030, the system will be revamped to cover smaller utilities.
• TAKEAWAY: This is a very bold move since only a year ago the gas utilities were asking the government to
push back their synthetic methane (e-methane) target of 1% of city gas sales by 2030. It indicates that there is
expectation for greater e-methane volumes to be available globally by the end of this decade and that the

Japanese gas companies feel more confident about price and security of supply.

Denso to test SOEC electrolyzer at JERA’s thermal power plant
(Japan NRG, Aug 5)
•  Denso and JERA inked a MoU to test solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolyzers at thermal
power plants starting FY2025.
•  Heat released at JERA’s power plant will perform electrolysis to produce hydrogen from steam.

•  Denso has been testing an SOEC prototype of several kW at its Hirose plant since July last year. It
developed a 200 kW system that will be tested at JERA’s plant. Multiple systems will be linked to
increase hydrogen output.
•  JERA plans to blend green hydrogen into ammonia fuel mix at the Hekinan power station. Denso
has no plan to partner with other power utilities on the SOEC.
•  CONTEXT: Denso’s original plan was to install a solar power system at the Hirose plant in 2025 to

power the electrolyzer. This is under review. At a 1% blending rate, Hekinan Unit 4 will need 8,000
tons/ year of hydrogen.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Denso licenses electrolyzer cell stack technology from Ceres Power
(Company statement, Aug 6)
o  Denso inked a licensing agreement with U.K.-based Ceres Power Holdings to
manufacture solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolyzer utilizing the stack structure

Ceres had developed.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Sekisui’s PSC film sheets were placed on the top and back of a lens-shaped panel developed by
TERRA. The panel shape reduces wind load by one third, requiring less supporting columns,
cutting installation time and costs.
•  CONTEXT: Sekisui PSC modules have a power
efficiency of about 15%. TERRA has installed four

panels, each with four of Sekisui 30 x 100 cm2 films.
TERRA plans to first grow barley that belongs to the
same grass family as rice, Japan’s main crop.
• TAKEAWAY: Silicon solar panels are usually configured in the
east-west direction but thanks to the PSC flexibility on curved
surfaces, north-south installations are now possible, resulting in
higher power output during morning and evening hours. The

output pattern may have positive impacts on the grids.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: This is Japan’s first public consultation on construction of an ammonia-fired power
plant. By 2030, Mazda plans to bring onstream the 110 MW gas turbine combined cycle plant that
would consume up to 1,240 tons of ammonia daily.
• TAKEAWAY: The Mazda plant won’t require state approvals as its output is below the 112.5 MW threshold.
However, local residents can request a public vote. The city panel may take time to draw conclusions as

operators have not specified whether they will use ammonia or ammonia cracking gas to generate power.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
•  MHI, Taiwan Fertilizer ink ammonia value chain MoU
•  (Company statement, Aug 7)

o  MHI and Taiwan Fertilizer inked an MoU to study an ammonia value chain consisting of
an import terminal, storage facilities, transportation and handling of the material, and
power generation.




METI/ ANRE to revise cybersecurity guidelines for power generation devices
(Government statement, Aug 2)
•  METI and ANRE will revise the nation’s cybersecurity guidelines for the Energy Resource
Aggregation Business (ERAB) that oversees small-scale "distributed energy resources" such as

solar power, BESS and private power generation equipment at homes and factories.
•  The guidelines will be revised by the end of FY2024, in light of the increase in demand response
(DR) services that do not involve gateways (GW), which enable networks with different
communication protocols to communicate with each other.
•  CONTEXT: When controlling air conditioning, BESS, and EVs as DR services, aggregators collect
information such as the amount of electricity consumed by the equipment. If this were to be
leaked, it could lead to burglaries or other crime.

•  CONTEXT: Traditionally, the main method for building energy management systems (BEMS) and
home energy management systems (HEMS) has been to place GW devices for communication and
control, but DR services via manufacturer clouds that do not involve GW have become increasingly
popular in recent years. METI will review requirements and policies for security measures based on
changes in the environment. Cyber attacks on IoT devices such as home appliances are also on the
rise, and the security requirements for IoT devices to be controlled by ERAB will also be a key
point of revision.




Seven firms start test trades of SAF-derived credits

(Company statement, Aug 2)
•  Itochu, ENEOS, Japan Airlines, Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Research & Technologies, Nippon Express
Holdings and Narita International Airport Corp began test trades of credits resulting from

ANRE suspends over 300 solar projects in violation of agricultural land law

(Government statement, Aug 5)
•  ANRE temporarily suspended FIT/ FIP subsidies for 342 farm-based solar power generation
projects that were found to be in violation of the Agricultural Land Law.
•  The suspended projects were run by 20 operators, with a total capacity of 17.5 MW. As many as 14
operators (327 projects) lacked permission to convert agricultural land within three years of FIT
certification.
•  The other six operators violated orders to improve or restore the original conditions.

•  CONTEXT: The measure to temporarily suspend FIT/ FIP subsidies was introduced in April to
encourage businesses in violation of laws to address the issues. The decision follows the
disciplinary measures imposed April 2 on nine solar power generation projects in clear violation of
the Forest and Forestry Basic Act.
• TAKEAWAY: This action will have almost no impact on the operation of serious solar developers in Japan, but
it should help improve the reputation of the sector with local communities nationwide because citizens will see
poorly executed projects and their owners punished. Should all of the suspended projects end up being

canceled, the loss in new capacity for Japan will be negligible.




Tokyo Gas to invest in Portugal’s floating offshore wind farm
(Company statement, Aug 6)
•  Japan's largest gas provider, Tokyo Gas, plans to buy a 21.2% stake in WindFloat Atlantic that

operates a 25 MW floating wind farm in Portugal off the Atlantic coast.
•  It’s majority-owned by Ocean Winds, a JV between Portugal's main utility EDP and France’s Engie.
Commercial operation launched in July 2020.
•  Windfloat Atlantic is one of only a few floating offshore wind farms in the world with around 10
MW-class wind turbines in commercial operation. It has three turbines, each with a capacity of 8
MW.
•  The tech used in the wind farm allows for operation in heavy storms with a max wave height of 20

meters and an instantaneous wind speed of up to 38.8 meters/ sec.
• TAKEAWAY: Tokyo Gas is among the Japanese pioneers rushing to invest in overseas projects with an intent
to bring the floating offshore wind tech home from advanced markets. With the recently launched Floating
Offshore Wind Technology Research Association and a group aiming to harness production tech for floating
wind turbines, participation in projects like WindFloat Atlantic is likely to benefit Japan in the next few years as
long as the domestic floating wind power sector doesn’t stall.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Solar and wind
In July, the country added 21 new utility-scale solar, wind and energy storage projects
with 9.6 GW of capacity to its renewable energy development pipeline, reported
Rystad Energy.

China / Electricity
The National Energy Administration issued 486 million green certificates, a 13-fold
YoY increase. This includes 197 million certificates for wind power generation, 102
million for conventional hydropower, 133 million for solar, 54.35 million for biomass,
and 16,500 for other renewable energy power generation.

China / High temperatures
Eastern China has faced high temperatures recently, with excessive heat lingering in
coastal cities in the industrialized provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the east and
northwest of China, temperatures reached 43.9 C, boosting power consumption.

China / Renewable power
In the first half of 2024, China added only 8 GW of coal capacity, far less than wind’s
25 GW, and solar’s 105 GW. By 2026, solar is expected to surpass coal as China’s
primary energy source.

India / Hydropower
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved $6.95 billion in investment for
the 669 MW Lower Arun Hydro Electric Project. The power generated will be fully
utilized in both Nepal’s and India’s grids.

LNG
Asia continues to draw LNG from Europe as imports in July rose the most in six
months, even as spot prices stayed near seven-month highs. The region is on track for
imports of 24.85 MMT, up from 22.6 MMT in June, and which is the highest since
January's 26.2 MMT, according to Kpler.

Malaysia / Fuel subsidies
Malaysia is phasing out gasoline and diesel subsidies as inflation eases. Fuel subsidies
put a cap on prices, with the govt covering the excess difference. Malaysia's gasoline
retail price is about 20% of the price in neighboring Singapore

Philippines / Solar power
Nexif Ratch Energy’s Calabanga Solar Project (CARE) in South Luzon launched
commercial operation. CARE is a 74.2 MWp ground-mounted solar PV project and the
first utility-scale solar power project in the Bicol Region.

Singapore / Electricity
On Aug 6, the Energy Transition Measures and Other Amendments Bill was
introduced in Parliament for its first reading, following a public consultation in May.
