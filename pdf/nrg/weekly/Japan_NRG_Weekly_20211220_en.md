NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


METI proposes new thermal power plants run at 20-30% to avoid curbs of renewables

(Japan NRG, Dec.15)
•  New and upgraded thermal power plants will run at rates of 20-30% during low demand days to
minimize curtailment of output from renewable energy sources, METI told the power transmission
systems working group.
•  Older plants will be asked to run at 30-50%, but power plants inside factory complexes (in-house
power generation) won’t be restricted. Plant run rates will be disclosed in the event that renewable
operators curb output.
•  Kyushu Electric Power Transmission and Distribution, which has curtailed output from renewable

power plants the most of any utility in Japan, asked solar and wind generators to curb output 44
times so far in 2021. This resulted in total output curtailment of 580 GWh, or 4.6% of the region’s
total renewable output. The company forecasts that it may curtail as much as 730 GWh of green
electricity in 2022 due to expanding solar capacities.
•  This year, other regions didn’t experience renewable output curbs but major utilities say it’s possible
this will occur in 2022.
•  Kyushu Electric said if its thermal plants ran at 20% operational capacity, then renewables would be

asked to curb 1% less output. This would also result in a CO2 reduction of 70,000 tons and ¥800
million in saved fuel costs.
•  METI stressed that renewable operators with online connections to the grid transmission systems will
face less risk of output curbs as they’ll be able to react quicker when conditions change.
• TAKEAWAY: This is quite a big victory for the non-EPCo sector in Japan. Regional grids previously told METI
that older thermal and nuclear power plants couldn’t be flexible with run rates. Gas turbine combined-cycle

(GTCC) LNG plants with high energy efficiencies are designed to run at minimum 50% rates. Critics, however,
said that allowing older thermal plants to operate without restriction would discourage new green investments in
Japan, leaving the country struck in a cycle of having to rely on those older plants to the end of their life cycle.
Aside from the environmental issues, it was argued to METI that this is not healthy in terms of energy security.

METI to build regulatory and market frameworks for power from storage batteries
(Japan NRG, Dec. 15)
•  METI plans to build regulatory and market frameworks for power supplies that become redundant in
times of low demand, so that they can be stores in batteries until demand picks up, a METI official

told the power transmission systems working group.
•  The scope and specifications of battery-stored power will be defined in the Electricity Business Act.
METI will also configure market mechanisms to sell the power.
•  A working group member and Tokyo University Professor Matsumura Toshihiro said METI could
change priorities. There are flaws in the present market mechanisms that need to be addressed,
notably the disconnects between the wholesale and retail markets. This must come first before

building a scheme for storage batteries.
• TAKEAWAY: Prof. Matsumura is not alone in raising concerns that METI may possibly be neglecting immediate
issues while focusing on future big-budget projects. Various current electricity “market mechanisms” (such as a
capacity market) were artificially created by METI rather than building on existing trade practices. This leaves the
ministry continually fine-tuning the market rules and mechanisms based on close exchange of views with market
stakeholders.

• That said, creating rules within which standalone batteries could operate and be part of the energy system
would welcome new entrants to the market and help offset grid disbalances.

• Japan needs to move fast in batteries or see another sector become reliant on overseas suppliers. In November,
Tesla launched sales of Powerwall storage battery systems for Japanese homes, at ¥1 million for 13.5 kWh, or
one third the price of local products. Tesla also plans to build a battery-based power station in Hokkaido.




TCFD’s growing role in Japan’s corporate governance
(Japan NRG, Dec. 16)
•  Climate impact reports according to the Taskforce for Climate Financial Disclosure (TCFD) format are
becoming mandatory rather than voluntary, said Nagamura Masaaki of Tokio Marine Holdings at the
De-Carbon Management Forum of the MoE.
•  Financial authorities are pushing a wider rollout of TFCD to Japanese businesses beyond the biggest

listed companies.
•  The Bank of Japan and the Financial Services Agency aim to make the TFCD system a part of
Japanese corporate governance.
•  CONTEXT: Over 500 companies have endorsed TCFD as of November 2021, making Japan the
system’s world’s largest supporter. Also, Scope 3 emissions are increasingly important in the
disclosures. Banks will be required to disclose emissions of companies and projects they’re

financing; and insurance companies will have to disclose the emissions of customers’ insurance
policies.


Peccell Technologies to launch Japan’s first mass production of perovskite solar cells

(Japan NRG, Dec. 16)
•  Yokohama-based Peccell Technologies will launch Japan’s first mass production of perovskite solar
cells in spring 2022.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  It will make customized table-cloth sized modules with an initial production run planned for up to 1
GW in total output.
•  The modules can be installed in buildings, such as in walls. They look similar to Poland’s Saule inkjet-
printed products that were commercialized earlier this year. But the Peccell modules have different
structures and their energy efficiency is 15% higher than those from Saule, a company official said.

•  CONTEXT: Polish firm Saule Technologies, the world’s first company to commercialize perovskite
solar cells, has actually received funding from Sawada Hideo, the chairman of HIS Co., one of
Japan’s largest travel and hospitality companies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Robotics to revolutionize perovskite cell production
(Nikkei X-Tech, Dec. 14)

o  While the invention of the perovskite solar cell was a major breakthrough, inventor
Miyasaka Tsutomu says manufacture on a commercial scale is difficult, as the slightest
variation can impact cell efficiency.
o  Earlier this year, Miyasaka invented a robotic system able to uniformly deposit perovskite
films, thereby ensuring reproducibility and high efficiency. Cells manufactured using the
technique have an efficiency of over 15%.



Green Innovation Fund adds six projects to review
(Japan NRG, Dec. 14)
•  METI is reviewing six potential new research projects for the Green Innovation Fund to develop
breakthrough decarbonization technologies: producing fuel from carbon, carbon separation and
collection, computing systems to improve vehicle energy efficiency, smart mobility systems,

reducing carbon in industrial waste treatment, and carbon absorption and reduction in food supply
chains.
•  To fund the new projects, the Green Innovation Fund’s reserve, set aside for potential game
changers, will be decreased to 20% from 30% of the total ¥2 trillion allocated to the Fund. An
experts panel will decide by March 2022 whether to go ahead with the above projects.
•  Allocated already is ¥1.33 trillion for 11 projects that include hydrogen steel, offshore wind,

perovskite solar cells, ammonia and hydrogen supply chains, green cement and concrete, and next-
generation storage batteries. Funding is for the next 10 years but will be cut if projects fail to meet
milestones; accelerating research is the key goal.
• TAKEAWAY: Changing Japan’s food supply chains by reducing Scope 3 emissions, improving process efficiency
and using more local supplies are all relevant to Japan’s commitment to the Inter-governmental Science Policy
Panel on Biodiversity (IPBES), which will update its goals in 2022. Japan ranks second after the U.S. as the
country generating most harm to global nature through food imports, according to the Institute of Global

Environment Studies (IGES).

Japan’s two major airlines pledge to use SAF for 10% of all aviation fuel by 2030
(Zaiten, December edition)
•  ANA and JAL, Japan’s two major airlines, joined the “Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition” in
September, which aims for a wider rollout of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The two companies
signed the pledge to have SAF account for 10% of total fuel by 2030, up from just 0.03% now.
•  CONTEXT: CO2 emissions from SAF are about 80% lower than the fuel now used by the airlines.
•  ANA and JAL estimate that to reach net-zero by 2050, they need at least 23 million kl a year. At

present, domestic production of SAF is negligible, which makes it hard for the airliners to introduce
it into operations. Thus, they want to speed up SAF production.
•  At present, ANA uses SAF on a freight flight between Narita and Frankfurt. The supplier is Nestle,
working with Nippon Express, Kintetsu World Express and Yusen Logistics.


“Clean Energy Strategy” panel hold inaugural meeting

(Japan NRG, Dec. 16)
•  METI advisors on “Clean Energy Strategy” held their first meeting on Dec. 16, which was joined by
members of the Green Transformation Panel and 2050 Carbon Neutrality Panel of ANRE. The Clean
Strategy will come up with technology transition scenarios on both the supply and demand sides to
meet carbon neutrality goals.
•  Companies lack the financial resources to achieve green transformation and so it needs to be done

in stages, one of the advisors urged.
•  The meeting agendas includes:
•  Building global ammonia supply chains partnering with countries heavily dependent on coal power,
•  Structural changes in the manufacturing sector,
•  Households developing diversified energy sources, more resilient to power cuts,
•  Pass on the costs of new energy infrastructure without straining stakeholders and consumers

OPINION: Essential perspectives in understanding Japan’s energy security

(Toyo Keizai opinion, Dec. 13)
•  CONTEXT: Toyo Keizai is one of the best-selling business weeklies.
•  At COP26, PM Kishida didn’t commit to the abolition of coal-fired power stations due to concerns
about energy security. Despite reliance on imports, many in Japan still don’t grasp energy security.
•  Japan needs to learn from Europe’s experience where a recent power shortage was due to poor
output from wind farms and other renewables.
•  EU Commission President Ursula von de Leyen said that nuclear energy and natural gas are needed

to solve the European energy crisis, and that both could be categorized as clean forms of energy.
•  By failing to take a clear position on nuclear energy, Japan has lost the chance to participate in the
debate over its future. While China and Russia are implementing state-led projects to develop small
modular reactors (SMR), in Japan the development of this technology has been left to the private
sector, causing it to lag behind
•  Energy policy is crucial to a nation’s existence and should involve the pooling of both public and
private sector resources. The Fukushima disaster shows how top-down bureaucracy jeopardizes a

nation’s energy security.


OPINION: Solar developments responsible for deforestation, landslides
(Nikkei opinion, Dec. 13)
•  CONTEXT: Nikkei is Japan’s biggest business daily.
•  In August, work to prepare a solar farm site in Kumamoto triggered a landslide after the contractor
failed to build a mandatory retention basin. Up to 10,000 m3 of earth was dislodged in the incident.
•  The landslide was the latest in a string of such incidents since the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme began

for solar generators.
•  NEDO plans to issue guidelines to ensure better drainage on solar farms built on inclined land. But
understanding of these issues is limited and it remains to be seen whether the guidelines will be
properly implemented.

Environment Ministry asks J-Power to add abatement options to coal plant in Kyushu
(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 17)
•  MoE urged METI to consider environmental grounds when reviewing plans from J-Power to upgrade
its coal-fired Matsushima station in Saikai City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
•  CONTEXT: This is the first time in three years that MoE submitted an opinion on coal-fired power
plants. It previously stopped making such suggestions after industry push back.
•  CONTEXT: Matsushima Thermal Power Plant is one of the oldest coal-fired power plants in Japan. It

began operation in 1981.
•  MoE recommends J-Power to introduce fuels that don’t emit CO2 when burned into the Matsushima
station’s fuel mix. This refers to biomass or ammonia and the MoE says it should be done as soon as
possible.
•  The MoE also said that “all options” should be considered, including decommissioning the plant if it
can’t be operated in line with Japan’s GHG emission reduction plans.

•  J-Power plans a coal gasification facility for Matsushima, construction to begin in 2024.
• TAKEAWAY: Given Japan’s commitments at COP26 and before, it would be a surprise if METI and J-Power push
against MoE’s suggestions. In fact, J-Power suggested that it would burn ammonia together with coal at one of
the two units of the 1 GW Matsushima station from around 2026/27. However, MoE’s comments may be trying
to accelerate the timeframe. J-Power’s reaction is worth monitoring.

•  The operator will increase output and plans to resume normal operation in Jan 2022. The plant
reaches its 40-year operation license in July 2024.
•  Meanwhile, a special inspection is scheduled for its Unit 2 reactor in late Feb 2022. Unit 2 will reach

its 40-year operation license in 4 years.


Tokyo Gas: 2 GW Chiba gas and hydrogen co-firing plant to start as early as 2028

(Nikkei, Dec. 15)
•  Tokyo Gas and the Kyushu Electric said their planned LNG-fired power station in Chiba might start
generating electricity in 2028.
•  The new power station will have an output of 2 GW.
•  The plant will have co-firing with hydrogen or ammonia to reduce GHGs.
•  Tokyo Gas CEO Uchida said he planned to progressively replace all of the utility’s Japanese and

overseas assets.
•  He also said that technological breakthroughs will be needed if Tokyo Gas is to achieve its zero
emissions goal by 2050.
•  While Tokyo Gas strives to be a majority stakeholder in solar and onshore wind ventures, Uchida said
that in offshore wind it will only be a minority investor due to a lack of experience with the
technology.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Tokyo Gas to invest ¥40 billion over this decade into new storage battery R&D
(Yomiuri Shimbun, Dec. 15)
o  Tokyo Gas plans to invest around ¥40 billion to develop storage batteries by 2030.
o  Storage batteries are essential for the spread of renewable energy, and Tokyo Gas wants
to work with overseas firms on R&D in this area.
o  This decade, Tokyo Gas plans to invest ¥600 billion in renewables in Japan and overseas.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI to guarantee income of hydrogen, ammonia generators
(Nikkei, Dec. 14)
o  METI is discussing a plan to guarantee operators of hydrogen and ammonia fired power
stations a minimum level of revenue for at least 10 years.
o  The plan, slated for introduction in 2023/24, will foster investment in these technologies,

thereby avoiding power shortages while reducing Japan’s carbon footprint.
o  This in effect creates a capacity market for plants that work on hydrogen/ ammonia fuel.
o  The government is also considering whether to cover investments to decarbonize
existing thermal plants and to extend the operating life of existing nuclear power plants.
o  Currently, new nuclear plant construction or the rebuilding of nuclear plants at existing
sites is still not on the government’s agenda.
• TAKEAWAY: Nothing kickstarts a sector’s growth like guaranteed income. We expect Tokyo Gas to be joined by

a string of other utilities in announcing commercial-scale co-firing power stations over the next year.

JERA and TEPCO renegotiate purchasing agreement to avoid power shortages
(Nikkei Energy Next, Dec. 14)
•  JERA head Noguchi Takashi says last winter’s electricity price spike led to renegotiating its power
purchase agreement with TEPCO Energy Partners.

•  Noguchi explains that deregulation means roughly a third of TEPCO EP subscribers have since
switched to independent electricity retailers, making it more difficult for JERA to forecast demand
trends in greater Tokyo.
•  Since JERA is the region’s largest supplier it absorbs blips in supply or demand, but the many
unknown variables mean this is no longer the case, says Noguchi.
•  Under its previous agreement with JERA, TEPCO EP could order additional electricity in an hour’s

notice. (While lead time on an LNG order is 2-3 months.)
•  To sell surplus electricity on the exchange to consumers in greater Tokyo, JERA previously went
through TEPCO, unable to supply the market directly.
•  Under the revised PPA, TEPCO EP must inform JERA of requirements for a given day before the
start of bidding on the energy spot market the day before. This allows JERA to release all surplus
capacity to the spot market.
•  Noguchi is critical of the state of the JEPX spot market. You could spend ¥10 billion buying LNG on

the spot market, but it would only yield ¥5 billion worth of electricity, he says.
•  To avoid a repeat of last year’s power shortages, power producers must alert the market before LNG
becomes scarce again, says Noguchi.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JERA to restart aging station amid fears of power shortages
(Nikkei, Dec. 16)
o  JERA carried out repairs on the long-idle Unit 5 at its Anegasaki power plant in Chiba,

which it plans to restart in January to avert power shortages.
o  The 600 MW unit can power 1.7 million households.



Top utilities like Chubu Electric are marketing local green electricity to local businesses

(Zaiten, December edition)
•  CONTEXT: This article shows how the big power utilities, EPCos, are trying to tap into the local-
power-for-local-people dynamic promoted by the government, while also using that to move a little
more into renewables.
•  In March 2020, Chubu Electric launched the “Shinshu Green Electricity Project,” which aims to raise
the value of local companies by helping them procure locally-sourced electricity from renewables,
thus lowering their CO2 footprint.
•  In August, Chubu Electric offered “green” electricity plans in Mie Prefecture, followed by Shizuoka

Prefecture in September and Gifu Prefecture in November.
•  Much of Chubu Electric’s green electricity plans are based on local hydropower.
•  The first company to buy green electricity in Gifu was Jyuroku Financial Group, which claims that
powering its HQ with renewables reduced annual CO2 emission by 754 tons.
• TAKEAWAY: While we often focus on the supply side, it’s important to keep an eye on consumers who are
literally buying into the “green revolution” in Japan. The initial wave over the last 1-2 years was from large

corporates. Now, the rollout of green electricity plans by big utilities is bringing local firms and SMEs into the

space. Those firms make up a far larger part of Japan’s economy and therefore can be a far bigger driver for
demand for electricity from renewable sources.



Power bills to remain high through February
(Nikkei, Dec. 17)
•  The high price of LNG means electricity tariffs set by Japan’s three largest utilities are projected to
rise around 4% between January and February.

TEPCO reports to METI on plans to release treated water from Fukushima
(Japan NRG, Dec. 14)
•  Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) plans to construct an undersea tunnel to release treated
water from its Fukushima nuclear plant, the company told the MoE panel monitoring the water

release.
•  The tunnel will be 1 km below sea level so that the sea water used for diluting the ALPS water will
not mix with the released water.
•  CONTEXT: Although processed by Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) to remove
radioactive elements, the water will still contain tritium.
•  The ALPS water will be diluted to 1,500 becquerel/ liter of tritium contamination. TEPCO will also

engage third-party inspectors to measure the water. The total tritium release will be under 22 trillion
becquerel/ year.
•  TEPCO will also grow olive flounder, sea shells and sea weeds in the area and will report how the
ALPS water impacts the local ecology.
• TAKEAWAY: The radioactivity level of the water is well below most international norms, but it is causing much
consternation both at the local level and among some of Japan’s neighbors.

LNG prices causes fuel oil orders to triple
(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 17)
•  Sugimori Tsutomu, chair of Petroleum Association of Japan and ENEOS, said it has three times the
usual level of bids for heavy fuel oil used in power generation.
•  This reflects high LNG prices, says Sugimori, because at current prices fuel oil is a cheaper source of

ANALYSIS

BY YURIY HUMBER


2021: Summary of a Year Across Key Energy Industries


Japan started the year with an electricity price crisis, but also a new Green Growth
Strategy that outlined new priorities in energy for many sectors. Since then, the prime
minister and the Cabinet have changed, and a new Basic Energy Plan was published.
As winter comes around, however, the same concerns about electricity shortages and
prices have returned.

Below we look back at some of the year’s key events in the major energy sectors. With
so much going on, we could not highlight all major events, but we hope this helps you
review some of the important narratives in each sector.


Coal

After making a splash in summer of 2020 by signaling the closure of the majority of
Japan’s coal-fired power plants within a decade, METI has largely failed to move
forward with its plans. First came resistance from manufacturers, which own more coal-
fired units than power utilities. Makers of chemicals, steel, concrete and other
industrial goods claimed that shutting the in-house coal plants would leave them
exposed to market prices for electricity, slashing profitability and increasing energy
supply security risks.

Government panels and experts then spent months debating the best way to decide
which coal plants should be closed. As things stand, very few coal plants will close
soon. In fact, for all the coal capacity to be shuttered in coming years, more new
capacity will be added. Proponents claim that the new coal-fired plants are cleaner
and necessary to maintain power price stability, which in turn helps provide economic
security for the country.
Adding carbon capture technology to coal-fired power plants is something
engineering firms like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are very keen to promote. Kansai
Electric is one of the most enthusiastic utilities in this space.

This year a new direction for coal took root — the switching of coal power plants to
co-firing ammonia or hydrogen. Japan’s government and big business are most
comfortable with these solutions. Moving the fuel mix to 40% ammonia/ 60% coal can
lower a power station’s CO2 emissions to the same level as if it were running on
natural gas, and test are already under way in Japan and the U.S. While many
questions remain, one thing seems certain — despite the wishes of many at COP26,
coal will not be making an exit any time soon.

Hydrogen / Ammonia
The hydrogen industry has grown exponentially in the last year. Japan’s belief in
hydrogen has always been strong, but it was solidified in the Green Growth Strategy
and the Basic Energy Plan. The former called for ammonia to “dilute” the fuel mix at
thermal power plants by 20% at the decade’s end. The latter claimed that hydrogen
or ammonia will make up 1% of Japan’s power mix by 2030 – suggesting that roughly
3 GW of hydrogen-fired capacity would be online by that time.

The policies have been followed by quick action from the private sector. Power
retailer Erex, which has ambitions of becoming a clean energy generation company,
will launch Japan’s first hydrogen-fired power plant by April 2022. The 300 kW facility
near Mt. Fuji is expected to deliver electricity to TEPCO Power Grid on a commercial
basis, while also testing a new hydrogen production process that extracts it from rocks
at ambient temperature.

On the transport side, Toyota launched an updated fuel cell electric vehicle; Tokyo
city started to trial fuel cell buses, trucks and even garbage collection vehicles; and,
major logistics companies began considering a fuel switch.

Hydrogen, however, has yet to find broad support for which form it should be
produced in (MCH, ammonia, liquid hydrogen or other). Also, there are debates over
which power sources should be used to manufacture it. Proponents of renewables
only want ‘green’ sources to be used. Many in industry and METI prefer “blue”
hydrogen made from coal or natural gas, with the CO2 sequestered and stored deep
underground.

Hydrogen’s main challenge, however, is to establish a “normal” environment for
transport and utilization, which also means how to store it. Kawasaki Heavy has
prepared the world’s first hydrogen carriers. Iwatani is developing solutions for
handling hydrogen at refueling stations. And Mitsubishi Heavy is working on a project
in the U.S. to store 150 GW hours’ worth of energy in the form of hydrogen gas in an
underground cavern carved into salt.

It’s certain that hydrogen will become mainstream this decade. It would be too much,
however, to bet on the color and source of hydrogen. That’s why Japan’s strategy so
far has been to diversify the geography of supply and manufacturing method as much
as possible.

Countries That Signed Agreements with Japan to Deliver Hydrogen

















LNG
Arguably the biggest beneficiary of the energy transition so far has been natural gas
and its adjacent LNG industry. Once intrinsically tied to oil, this year natural gas
evolved into a truly global market as weaker-than-expected performance from wind
and hydro generation assets in Europe and in Brazil, among others, boosted demand.

In contrast, Japan’s LNG industry is in a confused state, ceding to China its title of top
importer. The government’s latest Basic Energy Plan envisages cutting the use of LNG
in power generation by half this decade. Even longer-term, the influential Gas Study
Group at METI believes natural gas must seek decarbonization either through
hydrogen co-firing, or methanation, or (where possible) carbon capture.

Lower purchasing volumes means less influence on global LNG markets, endangering
energy security if rivals such as China lock up supplies with long-term deals. Experts
warn that China’s impact on Japan’s LNG purchasing strategies can lead to higher
prices.

Still, Japan’s position in LNG is not lost. METI forecasts that LNG purchases will grow
50% to 100 million tons by 2030. This is based on the idea that Japanese companies
will control LNG infrastructure and end-users in other parts of Asia and will buy supply
for the region.

Meanwhile, JERA last month flexed its muscle by rejecting a massive 5.5-million ton a
year contract with Qatar, allegedly because of the latter’s unwillingness to allow the
Japanese firm to divert cargos to other destinations. JERA has ambitions to be a
major LNG trader as well as importer for Japanese consumers, and needs to manage
its portfolio accordingly.

Other Middle Eastern suppliers who have been inflexible on where cargos are
delivered have seen Japan’s LNG purchases decline in recent years. But, Qatar quickly
found an alternative buyer in China, which puts JERA’s gamble into question.

Today, LNG costs translate into almost 60% of Japan’s electricity price. Until other
generation sources increase output, LNG will be a bellwether for the Japanese market

21

and electricity traders will pay as much attention to it as power market fundamentals.

The year’s big story for LNG was supposed to be the industry’s decarbonization.
Japan was one of the top voices calling for a cleanup of methane emissions at
production and transportation stages, and has been an enthusiastic supporter of the
“carbon neutral” LNG market. However, the net-zero story has been overtaken by
concerns about energy supply.

Nuclear
Japan’s nuclear industry had its best year in over a decade. Eight reactors (over 7 GW
of capacity) restarted between mid-December 2020 and this summer. While the total
number of units in operation is still in single-digits, last week’s bringing back online
the first unit of Kyushu Electric’s Sendai NPP puts the number at nine.

A further three units could restart next year, as well as two or three more in 2023, but
only if the facilities avoid further troubles and the fallout from ongoing scandals at
TEPCO. In a best-case scenario, we might see 15 nuclear reactors operating in Japan
in late 2023 and almost 20 units by mid-decade.

An even bigger boost for the industry was the restart of state funding for new nuclear
technology, which included a 14% rise in nuclear R&D budgets for 2022. This money
will mostly go to the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) program and the High Temperature
Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR).

While building new nuclear power stations or replacing aging facilities with modern
ones remains literally ‘radioactive’ for politicians, the contract won by GE-Hitachi
earlier this month to supply its first ever SMR unit to a Canadian utility was a
watershed. This was Japan’s first commercial win for next-generation nuclear
technologies and raised expectations for greater acceptance of SMRs in Japan.

With the U.S., Canada, and parts of Europe moving to a much more favorable stance
towards nuclear in the last six months, Japan’s ambivalence on the technology begins
to look like the odd man out. While previous PM Suga kept a distance from nuclear in
order to pursue a clean energy agenda more fixed on renewables, the new Kishida
government has welcomed back some familiar faces known to be pro-nuclear.

Solar
The solar industry struggled more than most this year. After a tripling of capacity in
the last decade, new growth slowed due to the ever-lowering Feed-In Tariffs, which
hit an average of just ¥10.31/ kWh in the November tender.

The industry’s competitive nature, the rising number of municipalities objecting to
new solar construction, and a general rise in costs, have all impacted Japan’s solar
power industry. Uncertainty ahead of the April 2022 switch to the Feed-In Premium
(FIP) system, which is supposed to encourage the addition of a storage component
but offers less guarantees on price, has also left some market participants nervous.

Goldman Sachs was one of the prominent names to exit Japan’s solar space this year,
selling its stake in Japan Renewable Energy (JRE) to ENEOS for about ¥200 billion.
The deal marked a changing of the guard, a moment in which the initial “cowboy” era
of the solar industry in Japan ended and a new generation began. Those likely to
thrive in the new era are comfortable with working at lower power prices. They are
nimble, more sophisticated technologists and engineers, and comfortable with hybrid
energy systems.

Of course, how firms like JRE compete in the new environment once they are under
the umbrella of large, traditional Japanese corporates like ENEOS is yet to be seen,
but the latter also bring something vital to the table: better government relations and
traditional domestic clients.

Another type of solar investor starting to emerge as a serious force in Japan this year
is the “white-label” energy provider. West Holding is the most prominent example
after it inked deals to supply Amazon (via Mitsubishi Corp) with 450 mini solar farms
and then a further 200 MW of solar capacity to Sumitomo Finance. Also, Itochu Corp,
one of Japan’s sharpest trading houses, invested in another domestic solar developer
and now plans to build 5,000 mini solar farms around the country by 2025.

While the above are drivers pushing private development, the MoE’s drastically
increased budget for next year indicates that the government too will play its part by
installing solar on rooftops of public facilities. For those looking for the next game-

changer in solar, the answer will likely lie in batteries and a shift to perovskite cell
technology. Both areas are major recipients of financing from the Green Innovation
Fund.

Wind
Japan’s most popular energy sector by far is wind, especially offshore. Membership of
the Japan Wind Power Association (JWF) surpassed 500 last month. The most active
include overseas firms Ørsted, Vestas, and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners
(Denmark); RWE (Germany); and Shell and SSE (UK); other prominent voices include
Equinor and Macquarie.

TEPCO, Kansai, Chubu, Kyushu and Tohoku Electric, J-Power and JERA are Japan’s
major power industry veterans vying for market entry, but there are also a large
number of non-electricity firms from the trading houses (Mitsubishi, Marubeni) to
transport firms (JR East) and oil and gas specialists (JAPEX, INPEX, Cosmo, ENEOS).

So far, there’s only been one tender concluded for a commercial-scale offshore wind
zone, off the coast of Nagasaki. An all-Japan consortium of eight firms is pooling
knowledge and resources to develop floating turbine technology that has yet to be
fully tamed anywhere in the world.

Earlier this month, bids for one more offshore wind zone (Happo-Noshiro) opened on
a deadline of June 10, 2022; the winners will be announced by December that year.
Many are concerned that the tender process is simply too long and slow.

One change that’s likely to improve the offshore wind process is the recently planned
shift in early-stage data collection. A METI subcommittee proposed to centralize the
collection of wind and meteorological data, as well as undersea geography and
transport capacity.

The wind sector today is still about 99% onshore and over the next decade the

biggest growth will continue to be on land. Onshore wind capacity could quadruple to
about 16 GW in 2030, while offshore will only reach about 3.7 GW. That’s quite a
come down from the announced 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 in the
Green Growth Strategy.

An undersea power grid that will connect Hokkaido and other northern offshore wind
farms to central Japan is the most prominent item of infrastructure now under
consideration (with initial estimates for the plan due in spring 2022).

Biomass
Bigger expectations are set aside for biomass, both via liquid and dry fuel and biogas
facilities. Biomass came to prominence in recent years thanks to power generation
and it already occupies a bigger share of the energy mix than wind and geothermal.
However, expectations from the government are focused on transport.

There are several paths for biofuels to develop. Mitsui & Co. is betting on ethanol and
the ability to convert that into SAF thanks to its stake in U.S. biomass startup LanzaJet.
With Brazil as a major supplier of sugarcane ethanol, Mitsui hopes to bring LanzaJet’s
SAF manufacturing technology to Japan by 2025.

Meanwhile, Euglena Inc. continues to tout the potential of algae-based biofuel. Once
Japan’s hottest startup, the company struggles to bring manufacturing costs to levels
that could compete with regular oil-based fuel. Over the last year, however, it moved
forward with testing of biofuels in buses and other transport.

The latest steps are thanks to a more flexible approach to source material; for
example, mixing algae-based oils with those from used cooking oils and animal fats,
which opens up a much wider market.

Arguably the most creative energy niche in Japan is biogas. Many projects involve
taking food, animal, and human waste and then processing that into a potent gas,
high in methane, for heating and cooling systems, as well as industrial purposes. The
so-called Renewable Natural Gas industry in Japan is still small, but it’s grown in the
last five years.

As of March 2020, there were 228 biogas power generation facilities under the state-
supported feed-in-tariff (FIT) scheme, with total capacity of 86 MW. That’s almost a
quadrupling compared with 2012 levels. The appeal is largely financial: Biogas-
generated power can claim an FIT of ¥39, which is more than triple that of solar.

Biogas has the potential to displace a lot of the natural gas Japan currently imports.
As one small step, Japanese industrial gas firm, Air Water, plans to set up liquified
biomethane production from cow dung at Hokkaido farms and says it could produce
the equivalent of half the LNG needed by Hokkaido factories.

These kinds of plans previously carried little weight given the high costs involved.
However, as LNG prices jump into the $40/ mmbtu range again this winter, a level
unimaginable a couple of years ago, the attractiveness of researching local biogas
resources grows.


Geothermal
Every few years, there’s a wave of interest in geothermal energy and the same
questions pop up: Why does a country with the world’s third-largest potential fail to
capitalize on it, especially when you consider that many top manufacturers of
geothermal power equipment are also Japanese? The latest surge in enthusiasm
appeared this year.

Most problems faced by geothermal energy developers are: access to land; winning
local approval; long lead time for site exploration; environmental surveys; small scale;
and other preliminary work. The truth is: over the course of a decade needed to

develop most geothermal projects, 10-times the power capacity can be added in
offshore wind.

Japan has about 0.5 GW of geothermal capacity. That may double or even triple this
decade, but with few companies willing to stake a claim as an industry leader it’s hard
to see strong momentum.

A boost for geothermal could come from Japanese projects overseas. JERA’s $1.6
billion acquisition of Philippines clean energy utility Aboitz Power includes geothermal
assets. The development of next-generation geothermal turbines that sit deeper and
are more efficient is led by U.S. startups, and Japanese firms have started to invest in
them. The fact that geothermal is also the only major renewables source that counts
as baseload power could promote this energy source further in coming years.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Hydrogen
The government wants to fast-track the $10 billion, 10 GW Desert Bloom green
hydrogen project being developed by Aqua Aerem. Huge solar-powered arrays will
both source water and produce hydrogen through electrolysis. The first fuel is
expected in 2023, and in 2027 it will reach a maximum capacity of 400,000 tons of
hydrogen.

Brazil/ Solar power
Brazilian natural gas and power utility Eneva is acquiring renewable energy firm Focus
Energia for $160 million, resulting in that company again going private just 10 months
after it held an IPO. Focus Energia is building over 3 GW of solar power capacity.

China/ Offshore wind power
EDF and China Energy Investment Corporation commissioned the 200 MW Dongtai 5
offshore wind farm north of Shanghai. Together with the 300 MW at Dongtai 4, the JV
now has 125 turbines with a total of 500 MW in offshore wind capacity in China.

Europe/ Carbon price
Carbon prices in the EU’s emissions trading system soared above €90 per ton, more
than double the value in July. Higher carbon prices improve the case for investment in
new technologies such as carbon capture and green hydrogen.

Fossil Fuels/ Investment
The International Energy Forum and IHS Markit said in a joint report that global annual
upstream investment needs to increase by as much as 50%, to $525 billion, if the
global oil market is to avert a severe supply shortage. This year, upstream investment
is estimated at $340 billion, almost 25% below 2019 levels.

France/ Nuclear power
Safety concerns forced EDF to shut two nuclear power plants, Civaux and Chooz, each
with two reactors. Corrosion of reactor pipes is to blame. The four reactors have a
combined capacity of 6 GW. Analysts said the shutdown will continue into next year.

Germany/ Natural gas
Natural gas storage inventory dropped below 60% for the first time in many years,
according to the German Association of Underground Gas Storage Operators. This
“historical low” is seen as a troubling development as winter begins.

Green finance/ HSBC
Europe’s top banker to Asia wants clients to have a plan to exit fossil fuels by late
2023. Following its pledge not to finance new coal-fired power plants or coal mines,
HSBC will cut exposure to thermal coal financing 25% by 2025, and 50% by 2030.
However, non-EU clients could be funded until a global phase-out by 2040.

India/ Solar power
Adani Green Energy inked a deal with state-run Solar Energy Corp to sell 4.7 GW of
solar power. Adani now has buyers for 6 GW of the 8 GW of its planned solar
capacity. Adani will invest $70 billion in renewables by 2030, and it wants to be the
world’s largest renewables company by 2030. Currently, Adani ranks No. 30, says
Bloomberg.

Spain/ Wind power
For the first time, wind power overtook nuclear power in the national energy mix.
Experts say that wind will eventually dominate the Spanish electricity grid as installed
capacity of wind turbines is expected to double between now and 2030.

Turkey/ Geothermal power
The World Bank will loan Ankara $300 million to support the country’s Geothermal
Development Project that will build 380 MW of capacity by tapping heat sources deep
in the ground.

U.S./ Coal
By late 2028, American Electric Power Co. will shut both units at the 2.6 GW Rockport
coal-fired plant in Indiana. By 2024, which is 15 years earlier than planned, Ameren
Corp. will close its 1.3 GW Rush Island coal-fired power plant near St Louis. The
company doesn’t want to install pollution controls that would cost $1 billion.

U.S./ Clean energy
Biden ordered state agencies to stop financing new fossil fuel projects overseas and
to instead promote net-zero goals and clean energy projects across the globe. This
order, however, can be sidestepped when fossil fuel projects are vital to national
security.
