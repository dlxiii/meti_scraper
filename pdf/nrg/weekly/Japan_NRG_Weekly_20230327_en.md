NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Government announces additional ¥1.2 trillion package to curb inflation
(Government statement, March 22)
•  The govt announced a ¥1.2 trillion package to curb inflation by subsidizing LP gas users as well as
consumers of high-voltage power such as schools, hospitals, etc.
•  ¥30,000 will be provided to low-income households exempted from residential tax.
•  Renewable surcharges included in the electricity bills will be reduced from April bills, and power

utilities seeking rate hikes are to reassess their plans.
•  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries will cover 70% of the energy cost rise of farms

OCCTO  releases 2023 supply plan; Supply-demand imbalance of Tokyo Area still unresolved

(Denki Shimbun, Mar. 24)
•  OCCTO disclosed its supply plan for FY2023 through 2032 at the advisers council on March 22.
The electric supply reliability of the Tokyo Area for FY2023 is less than required, and TEPCO might
face difficulty in balancing demand and supply.
•  Moreover, the reserve margin of the Tokyo Area in case of severe heat that’s forecasted once in a
decade slightly surpassed 3%, a level that might cause a blackout if other facilities are in trouble.
•  In addition, the grid oversight body noted concerns about a supply-demand mismatch in other
areas over the next decade. In Hokkaido, there’s worry about the situation in 2027. In Tokyo, it’s

the years 2025 and 2026; in Kyushu, it’s 2025 and 2027 to 2029; while in Okinawa, it is 2025 to
2026 and 2029 to 2032.
•  OCCTO will soon submit a final report to the METI Minister.
• TAKEAWAY: The report suggests a review of the Capacity Market is needed so that more power supply can be
secured when demand-supply balance is tight. During FY2023, a total of 2.43 GW of thermal power capacity
will stop operation. This suggests further market tightness in the near future.

Hokkaido Electric improves full year forecast thanks to decline in JEPX prices
(Company statement and media reports, March 23)
•  Hokkaido Electric announced an upward revision to its earnings forecast for fiscal year 2022, in
large part due to a decline in JEPX wholesale power market prices.
•  The operating loss is expected to drop by ¥27 billion to ¥24 billion (from the ¥51 billion number
announced in January). However, revenue was also revised down by ¥24 billion to ¥897 billion,

driven by more electricity sales to retailers and to the JEPX.
•  This year, wholesale electricity prices have cooled in line with the drop in fuel prices and power
demand.
•  The utility said that a shorter construction period to upgrade its Tomato-Atsuma coal-fired power
plant, and an increase in hydro power output, also contributed to the improved financial
performance.
• TAKEAWAY: Hokkaido Electric has pinned its hopes on improving the financial performance on the restart of

its three-unit Tomari NPP. The nuclear station has not operated since May 2012 and it has been under NRA
review for close to a decade. Recently, there seemed to be some progress in the regulator’s review of Tomari’s

The NRA accused JAEA of seven additional faults at Tsuruga Unit 2 – restart now at risk
(Denki Shimbun, Mar. 20)
•  New problems have been discovered that might delay the restart of Tsuruga NPP Unit 2.
•  At the previous meeting, the NRA said plant operator Japan Atomic Power Company (JAEA) didn’t

comply with protocol for taking samples on earthquake protection performance. Now, the NRA
found seven more issues in the document submitted by JAEA at the last meeting. These concern
the procedures used to take samples of geological data.
•  Committee member Mr. Naito said JAEA’s sloppiness was “extremely regrettable”; another
committee member, Dr. Ishiwatari, said the NRA will meet in April to discuss whether to continue
the review of Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 or not.
• TAKEAWAY: The decommissioning of Tsuruga NPP Unit 1 started in April 2015, not long after the Fukushima

accident. Now, only Unit 2 is operable (after a restart was certified by the NRA), but two new units, namely Unit
3 and 4 are planned at this site. Therefore, if JAEA doesn’t get a green light for restart of Unit 2, the
construction of Unit 3 and 4 might be endangered. That would be a nightmare for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
which began work on those two units.

Hiroshima High Court throws out appeal to stop Shikoku Electric’s Ikata NPP Unit 3

(Yomiuri Shimbun, March 24)
•  The Hiroshima High Court threw out an immediate appeal by seven residents in both Hiroshima
and Ehime Pref to stop operation of Shikoku Electric’s Ikata NPP Unit 3.
•  Previously, the Hiroshima Local Court rejected residents’ appeal for a temporary injunction to stop
Ikata Unit 3 in Nov 2021, but residents immediately filed an appeal.
•  The biggest issue for this lawsuit was anti-earthquake measures, which Shikoku Electric claimed to
be sufficient, a claim the residents disputed.
• TAKEAWAY: This is the 12th case of a citizen group applying for a temporary injunction to stop Ikata NPP’s

Unit 3 from operating. Already, 10 cases have been thrown out by the court. Unit 3 (890 MW, PWR) is currently
under scheduled maintenance, but Shikoku Electric plans a restart on May 25.

Baseload Electricity Market: EPCOs and New Market Players
Vie for Cheap Electricity Volumes

The full liberalization of the electricity market in 2016 was one of Japan’s most
significant developments of the past decade. That process has allowed a wide variety
of new players to enter the market, including firms from the oil, telecommunications
and other sectors.

Many of the new entrants believed they could compete and profit by buying
electricity and reselling it at prices lower than those offered by Japan’s 10 major
power utilities collectively known as the EPCOs. Seven years later, however, the logic
of the new players’ business model – and by extension the liberalization itself – is
being questioned by some in the industry and the media. After all, current results
differ from the picture painted by officials prior to 2016.
The main question was and remains: Where can companies that don’t generate
electricity acquire electricity to sell? New players, often referred to as shin denryoku
(“new power companies”) who do not have enough of their own power generation
capacity to cover the needs of their customers largely depend on buying power
directly from generators or on the wholesale market. For the former, new players need
to offer better terms than those that the generators can secure themselves.
Meanwhile, the latter option is limited by the volume that the power generation
companies are willing to feed to the market.

For a while, during a period of declining electricity prices, the EPCOs found it
profitable to sell some output on the wholesale market. In the last two years, the price
trend has reversed and grown more volatile while a growing capacity crunch has
made power generators cautious about sharing volumes.

What makes the situation even more complicated is the bifurcation of the power
market by energy source. Most new capacity is solar or wind; it’s sold through
elevated state tariffs; and, it’s owned by smaller generators. But the bulk of Japan’s
power system is propped up by thermal, nuclear, and hydro power plants, which are
known as baseload capacity, and which are almost entirely owned by the EPCOs.

For shin denryoku to compete, they need more baseload power to be available on
the market, especially because it includes some of the cheapest power facilities in the
country. But EPCOs feel that this capacity has been paid for with their sweat (and
blood), and should remain their competitive advantage.

As the government seeks to find a solution between the warring sides, it knows that
finding the right model for sharing baseload power will be key to fostering
competition.


What’s at stake
The EPCOs spent many years and tremendous amounts of investment to build the
nation’s energy infrastructure. In some cases, this came at a human cost. For example,


16


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

construction of the Kurobe Dam (Kurobe No. 4 Hydropower Plant) owned by Kansai
Electric claimed 171 victims by the time it was completed in 1963.

Given the history, the EPCOs don’t want to part with their hard-earned baseload
electricity and hand it over to the new power market players. For their part, new
power market players believe that the current system has been manipulated by the
deeply entrenched EPCOs, which can count on old relationships to manipulate
regulations and markets.

The impasse between the two feuding sides has been a factor slowing the growth in
Japan’s power generation sector. With EPCOs the owners of most of the thermal and
all of nuclear generation, and solar and wind facilities in the hands of other
generators, the split extends to battles over Japan’s vision for its future power mix.

And so, everyone agrees that METI urgently needs to reform the system. The
challenge is to accommodate the interests of the EPCOs and the ambitions of new
power market players, with both sides currently criticizing the system as unfair.

Towards that goal, in July 2019 METI set up the Baseload Electricity Market. It was
meant to invigorate the electricity retail market by obliging EPCOs to sell a portion of
their baseload output on the wholesale JEPX market. This effectively opened the gate
for coal, hydro (but not pumped storage), and geothermal and nuclear power plants
to operate on open market terms. It also bridged the gap for retailers that only had
access to electricity from renewable sources during peak demand times of the day.















Baseload auction system
A baseload contract runs for up to 12 consecutive months, providing power each day
over 24 hours.

During the first two years after the introduction of this market segment, baseload
power was sold via an auction, which was held three times a year. Today, auctions are
held four times a year: in July, September, November and January; but, the EPCOs
are allowed to skip the fourth auction. Each auction trades electricity for the following
year, they’re held in three regions: Hokkaido; East Japan; and West Japan. Okinawa is
the only region excluded from this market.

The EPCOs are required to sell a proportion of their baseload power according to a
formula that calculates their power mix, and the rate of switched customers. In

17

October 2017, METI unveiled a preliminary calculation for how much of their total
volume the EPCOs must sell to the baseload market.

Hokkaido Tohoku Tokyo  Chubu Hokuriku Kansai Chugoku Shikoku Kyushu
4.88%  8.26%  36.85% 11.11%  2.61%  19.92%  5.27%  2.41%  8.69%
Source: EGC
At the start, METI said it would operate the Baseload Electricity Market until the new
players (shin denryoku) controlled about 30% of all power sold in Japan. And, until
about two years ago, the industry was heading in that direction. New players gained
about 22% of the power market.

The trend stalled as a series of energy crises since the 2020 onset of the Covid
pandemic has roiled markets. But there was trouble even before that.

At the first Baseload Electricity Market held in July 2019, the prices posted by the
EPCOs were much higher than what new power market players expected. The price
for the Tokyo Area Baseload Electricity Market auction was ¥9.77/ kWh. This was as
much as a fifth less than the JEPX spot market price at the time, but almost double
what some new market players said they expected.

With such a mismatch, TEPCO and Tohoku Electric ended up selling only 1.6 TWh of
electricity in the 2019 auction, which was just 2% of the total volume executed at this
auction. To put another way, only 2% of baseload electricity sold by Tohoku Electric
and TEPCO was considered affordable by the new power market players.

The Baseload Market remained in this steady if anemic state for two years, but in 2021
volumes fell 90% compared to the year before as rising fossil fuel prices filtered into
the cost of electricity. The market regained some momentum during the third auction
of 2021, but most of the contracts were signed for the Kansai Area, which largely
reflected the improving power capacity situation there due to a restart of several
nuclear reactors.

A similar story continued with auctions since then. As East Japan (including the Tokyo
area) and Hokkaido face a capacity crunch, the prices asked by EPCOs have failed to
entice buyers and volumes have shrunk even further. Only in West Japan has baseload
contract trading increased, again arguably due to the availability of nuclear power.

Ripe for a change
Noting the auctions situation, in 2022 METI began discussions to reform the Baseload
Electricity Market. During the most recent government meeting on this issue, held on
Feb 20, some experts pointed out that one of the issues affecting the mechanism is an
unclear process for fuel cost calculations. It was also noted that the EPCOs seem to
sell electricity volumes to affiliated power retailers at prices that reflect the variable
cost of fuel.

Meanwhile, the EPCOs offer baseload electricity contracts at prices that appear to
factor the upper range of fuel costs. Also, those at the meeting discussed the
potential to extend baseload contract terms beyond a year.

There are a few ways that METI can tackle the perceived discrepancy. One option is to
ask the EPCOs to clarify their fuel cost calculations. Another is to add an adjustment
mechanism to Baseload prices to reflect volatility in fuel costs. Yet another option,
suggested by experts on a METI panel overseeing the issue, is to fix the price based
on the one that the EPCOs use to sell surplus power to their affiliated retail
companies.

After hearing various export and industry views, METI proposed to follow the second
option: add a mechanism to adjust baseload contract prices in line with fuel costs. The
ministry has yet to provide further details on how this will be introduced.


Squaring the circle
The latest development by METI reflects the difficulty of marrying two very different
sets of industry players. The EPCOs were responsible for almost the entirety of
Japan’s electricity network until liberalization and they’ve spent decades creating the
system as it exists today. They feel that new market entrants are getting a free ride on
the back of their assets, which are relatively cheap to operate today thanks to massive
investments in the past.

New players naturally ask for rules that can help them compete. Otherwise, they
argue, what was the point of introducing market competition in Japan?

Without a way to incentivise the transfer of electricity between the two sets of players,
Japan risks returning to an oligopoly of 10 major regional utilities. And while METI is
tweaking the Baseload Electricity Market system, it’s unclear whether the changes
would address the key question posed earlier: What will make asset-lite new market
entrants more competitive than the power generators from which they secure
volumes?

The answer possibly lies in the two “Transformations” that the government has set as
a target for Japan: Green (GX) and Digital (DX). The rapidly expanding local power
derivatives market will also play a big role. The two warring sides may find that in the
nexus of these three trends they can offer each other solutions, not only competition.

Kawasaki City’s Industrial Cluster Aims to Turn Oil Refining
Heartland into Clean Energy Hub

In the mid-1950’s, Japan began developing vast industrial complexes along its eastern
coastline to support the development of the country’s petroleum, petrochemical and
steel industries during a post-WWII boom. This was also a time when the nation’s
focus on energy resources shifted from coal to oil.

More than a half century later, these complexes face a herculean challenge to
transition their fossil fuel-intensive industries to cleaner alternatives all the while trying
to maintain international competitiveness.

An interesting example of how the transformation may turn out lies in Kawasaki, a port
city just south of Tokyo. The city hosts one of Japan’s major petrochemical industrial
clusters. Now, Kawasaki wants to gain recognition as a leader in efforts to decarbonize
the traditional industrial sector.

In January, Kawasaki City became Japan’s first industrial cluster to join an initiative
launched by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and Accenture and the Electric Power
Research Institute. Named the Transition Industrial Clusters Towards Net Zero, the
project supports industrial clusters in their efforts to achieve net zero emissions.

The WEF’s initiative so far includes 17 industrial clusters in the Netherlands, the U.S.,
Belgium, the U.K., Spain, Australia, Indonesia, China and Japan. Eventually, it aims to
sign on 100 industrial clusters globally in a collective effort that would reduce 1.6
billion metric tons of CO2 emissions, possibly contributing $2.5 trillion to global GDP.

Decarbonizing major industries worldwide is crucial because they’re responsible for
30% of global CO2 emissions. Yet, there’s still no consensus on the most effective
clean technologies to reach net-zero for industry. Among the top candidates are
carbon capture and hydrogen, both of which require significant investments.


Kawasaki City’s GHG emissions
Kawasaki City’s main industries are oil, chemicals and steel, with ENEOS, Kao, and
Asahi Kasei among its largest enterprises. Emissions from the top 30 companies
operating in its industrial cluster account for 73% of Kawasaki City’s total emissions.

Kawasaki City’s entry into the WEF project followed plans for a carbon neutral
industrial cluster that was launched in March 2022. The city also set up a private-
public council, which has 71 member companies, in order to push through measures
to achieve carbon neutrality.

According to the city’s carbon neutrality plans, the main focus will be development in
three key areas:
1) A supply base for carbon neutral energy centered on hydrogen
2) An industrial cluster around the carbon cycle
3) A competitive industrial area with optimized use of energy.

1) Hydrogen Push:
Kawasaki City is betting on hydrogen thanks to the area’s expertise as an early
adopter of hydrogen technologies. The city was ahead of other municipalities when it
put together a hydrogen strategy in 2015, and it has been conducting pilot programs
with the government and companies. It is home to hydrogen-related industries, such
as manufacturers of fuel cells and parts for hydrogen stations.

Furthermore, the cluster’s supply and demand for hydrogen accounts for about 10%
of Japan’s total. The area has one of Japan’s longest pipe networks to deliver
hydrogen, which is commonly used in manufacturing.


Goals to 2030  ●  Build an import hub for hydrogen
●  Research hydrogen supply systems using hydrogen pipes
●  Strengthen production and supply functions of hydrogen using equipment for
refining and waste plastic processing
●  Cooperate with high-volume users of hydrogen

●  Work with Haneda Airport to utilize hydrogen there
●  Promote construction of hydrogen refueling stations
●  Disseminate information on hydrogen


Goals for      ●  Build a supply system for hydrogen using hydrogen pipes
2030~2050      ●  Promote hydrogen co-firing at gas-fired power plants
●  Promote use of carbon recycled methane and synthetic fuels
●  Expand use of hydrogen in transportation such as FCVs
●  Improve social acceptance of hydrogen

Source: Kawasaki City

Now, Kawasaki City aims to expand supply and consumption of the fuel further. In
order to keep its status as energy supplier for Tokyo and the surrounding regions,
Kawasaki City needs to serve as a receiving terminal for imported hydrogen.

The city also notes the need to develop a supply system for both imported and locally
produced “CO2-free” hydrogen, referring to green hydrogen (generated using
renewable power sources) and blue hydrogen (produced from natural gas with carbon
capture technology). The city has three objectives to boost hydrogen use: 1) Build a
system to supply CO2-free hydrogen; 2) Expand demand for CO2-free hydrogen; and
3) Improve social acceptance of CO2-free hydrogen.

2) Improving the carbon cycle:
Kawasaki City has a high concentration of recycling businesses, including for plastic.
Some of the plastic waste is incinerated, which increases GHG emissions. Therefore,
the city plans to expand plastic recycling and also to expand the use of CO2 captured
from nearby factories. The city’s objectives are: 1) Expand the scope of recycling of
CO2 and plastic; 2) Introduce innovative recycling measures; and 3) Promote
understanding among citizens and companies


~2030          ● Build advanced facilities for separating plastic waste, work on pilot projects for
advanced recycling technology
● Develop a plan to use CO2 effectively among companies
● Manufacture and supply alternative aviation fuels
● Promote public awareness to separate waste plastics



2030~2050      ● Introduce new plastic recycling methods
● Develop a system for effective recycling of CO2
● Invite companies to manufacture items from recyclable carbon resources

Source: Kawasaki City

3) Optimizing energy use
One of Kawasaki’s biggest challenges is to decarbonize the cluster’s energy use. The
city’s port serves as a major import hub for crude oil and LNG, accounting for about
10% of Japan’s total imports. The area has more than 8 GW of power generation
capacity, including three commercial gas-fired power plants, and a city gas production
facility, making it a major energy supplier. The city also has renewable power plants
(biomass, solar, wind) and two oil refineries.

The following are some of the challenges.
• Low potential for local renewables capacity: According to Kawasaki City’s

estimates, renewable energy could supply 1,655 GWh by 2050, but that is only
9% of current power consumption. The chart below shows estimates of the city’s
renewable energy capacity and potential.
• There is an increasing need to decarbonize the entire supply chain starting with
sourcing of materials, as well as during manufacturing and post-manufacturing.
• Most CO2 emissions come from heat production, but there’s a lack of established
methods to decarbonize it; possible measures include electrification (i.e.,

installation of electrical furnaces), switching to hydrogen and ammonia fuels (i.e.,
installation of hydrogen and ammonia boilers), as well as synthetic fuels/gasses.

measures.

Beacon to the rest of Japan?
Kawasaki City’s efforts follow in the wake of the central government’s push for
“carbon neutral ports,” which will serve as import and storage facilities for hydrogen
and fuel ammonia, improve port functions and coordinate with local industries to
achieve zero GHG emissions. Kawasaki’s experience could serve as a guide for other
major ports around Japan, with discussions around “carbon neutral ports" also taking
place in Yamaguchi and Ibaraki prefectures.

Meanwhile, Japan has seven other petrochemical industrial complexes, which face the
equally challenging prospect of finding ways to decarbonize and may look to copy
Kawasaki’s playbook.

One issue that all these places may face, however, is cost. Many of the measures
under consideration in Japan’s industrial heartlands at present revolve around
hydrogen. But prices for the clean-burning fuel are too high for widespread adoption
and the production of hydrogen itself is not always done without generating
emissions.

So it’s not surprising that at this stage, Kawasaki City’s clean industry plans lack details
on the scope of emissions that will be cut, the investments required, or a detailed
roadmap to net zero. It will be up to companies to join the local efforts and help plot
a more precise course.

For its part, the city will need to step up efforts to ensure close coordination with the
private sector so that everyone is on the same page and the energy transition
proceeds with minimal disruptions and dislocation.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ Russian energy imports
Since March 1, 2022, China has imported from Russia oil, gas and coal to the tune
of $88 billion; this is about 60% more YoY. The rise reflects both increased volumes
and higher prices for the commodities.

Commodities trading
Energy trader Gunvor seeks to expand its oil trading and develop power trading.
Gunvor traditionally focuses on oil and gas, metals and bulk commodities, but it has in
recent years also begun trading power in Europe. The company set up a power desk
last year in the U.S. and will start gasoline blending operations there.

EU/ Nuclear power
Last Energy, a startup developing small nuclear power plants, signed four deals worth
$18.9 billion to build 34 reactors in the EU. The U.S. company expects to install the
first of its 20-MW systems in 2025.

France/ Strikes
Several refineries were still blocked after two weeks of strikes, disrupting production
and power supply. Strategic reserves of fuel have had to be utilised. Also, due to
strikes, at least 14 nuclear reactors in EDF's fleet of 56 suffered delay in their
maintenance plans.

India/ Energy transition
India can attain energy independence by 2047, says a study by the U.S. Department
of Energy. But India's energy infrastructure requires $3 trillion in investments over the
next several decades.

Scotland/ Pumped hydro
UK power generator SSE will invest £100 million in a pumped hydro plan that could
boost energy storage capacity. Pumped hydro plants work by pumping water uphill to
a reservoir before releasing it; the flow downhill through turbines produces electricity.

UK/ Carbon capture
Power generator Drax will pause its £2 billion investment in bioenergy with carbon
capture and storage (BECCS) until it receives clarity on state support. Drax needs a
commitment to BECCS before it will install the technology at its 2.6 GW biomass
power plant in Yorkshire.

UN/ Climate change
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report seen as a final
warning to act swiftly on climate change. Global warming will “more likely than not”
exceed 1.5 C in the near-term. Current policies put the world on track for warming of
3.2 C by 2100.

U.S. / EV chargers
Manufacturers and operators of EV chargers are bracing for a slowdown in production
and deployment as they scramble to comply with "Made in America" terms of a $7.5
billion federal program meant to accelerate the industry. Companies warn that the
country lacks the domestic production capacity - particularly on high-speed chargers.

U.S./ LNG
Sempra Energy greenlighted its $13 billion Port Arthur LNG terminal on the Gulf
Coast. The 13.5 million ton per year “phase 1” facility — to come online by 2028 —
will add another roughly 10% to the capacity of existing projects and those under
construction.
