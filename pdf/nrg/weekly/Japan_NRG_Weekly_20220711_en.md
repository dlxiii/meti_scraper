PM Kishida’s ruling party clinches landslide
(Various reports, July 11)
•  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister Kishida, won the majority of the
125 seats contested in the Upper House elections yesterday. Together with its coalition partner,
the Komeito, the bloc will hold the majority in in the upper chamber.
•  The strong win increases the chance that the government will move to revise Japan’s 1947

constitution, which has not been amended since its introduction. Pro-reformers argue this is
needed to fully acknowledge the existence and authority of the Self-Defense Forces in Japan,
among other reasons.
•  A record number of people voted in the Upper House election, according to government data.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Editorial: government needs to articulate direction on energy
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, July 6)
o  CONTEXT: Nikkan Kogyo is the top paper for the manufacturing industry in Japan.

o  METI’s decision to phase out coal-fired power stations was correct. After all, Japan is
often singled out for reliance on coal and reluctance to commit to emissions targets.
o  However, don’t forget the need to ensure a consistent electricity supply.
o  Fossil fuel plants generate 32% of Japan’s electricity, and about half of this will soon be
phased out.
o  To ensure a sufficient electricity supply while keeping CO2 emissions low, Japan must

make renewables the backbone of its electricity supply and restart idle nuclear plants.
o  We should treat this as an opportunity to not only phase out coal-fired plants, but also to
create a more resilient energy policy. To this end, the government should articulate
nuclear power’s role and obtain more community support.


Former PM Abe killed by gunman during campaign speech

(Various reports, July 8)
•  Former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo died after being shot on July 8 by a lone gunman during a
street campaign rally.
•  Abe, Japan's longest-serving leader, was 67.
•  Abe was shot at while delivering a street speech in the western city of Nara ahead of July 10's
Upper House election.
•  The police arrested a 41-year-old man, identified as Nara resident Yamagami Tetsuya. He was

reported to have previously served in the Maritime Self-Defense Force. He made his own gun.
•  According to a police statement, the man revealed that he had a “grudge" against a certain
group, and considered Abe to be connected to this group.
•  Abe stepped down as premier in the summer of 2020, but remained a lower house lawmaker and
leader of the biggest faction in the ruling party.

| Abe stepped down as premier in the summer of 2020, but remained a lower house lawmaker and |
| leader of the biggest faction in the ruling party. |

• TAKEAWAY: Abe was one of the most influential politicians in Japan even after stepping down. He was not
closely associated with energy matters, but has spoken frequently since 2020 about the need for Japan to
embrace nuclear power once again. A short review of his impact on energy matters is in the Analysis section.




Japan aims to demonstrate carbon-neutral ships by 2026
(Asia Nikkei, July 7)
•  The government is teaming up with local shipping lines and shipbuilders to develop new types of
vessels fueled by ammonia or hydrogen. About ¥35 billion worth of state financial support is lined

up over 10 years.
•  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism is already working with private firms
including Nippon Yusen, Kawasaki Kisen and Imabari Shipbuilding, Japan's largest shipbuilder, to
expedite the use of "zero-emission ships."
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries and other concerns will develop hydrogen engines, ready for
demonstration operations ub 2027. Meanwhile, Nippon Yusen and trading house Itochu are
researching ammonia-fueled ships, which could start from 2026. Commercial operations are

targeted for a few years after that.



Government to reduce transmission costs to renewable generators
(Nikkei, July 3)
•  Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Kajiyama Hiroshi announced that inefficient coal-fired
power plants will be progressively phased out, signaling an increased focus on renewable energy.
•  While generators face a flat fee of about ¥150/ kW for use of transmission lines, this is

disadvantageous for renewable generators, which experience fluctuating output.
•  METI aims to significantly reduce transmission costs faced by renewable generators.
•  METI also will review rules for transmission line access to give renewable generators priority when
supply outstrips capacity.
•  The details will be determined with experts to ensure that the stability of electricity supply from
thermal plants is not jeopardized.




MoE publishes sustainability-linked bond guidelines
(Government Statement, July 7)
•  The MoE published sustainability-linked bond guidelines and updated green bond guidelines to
reflect recent international trends. Sustainability-linked bond guidelines are designed to spur
dialogs between bond issuers and buyers. The issuers show long-term sustainability targets and
disclose achievements regularly. Updated green bond guidelines clarified the definition of green

financing.

MoE to hold town meetings on Decarbonization Support Inc.
(Government Statement, July 7)
•  The MoE will hold town meetings on the Decarbonization Support Organization Corporation, a
newly established government-backed firm that will finance net zero projects. They will take place

from July 20 to August 24 in key cities of Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya, Osaka, Okayama and
Kumamoto, but not in Tokyo, as its aim is to reach out to areas with limited financing. The firm
launches officially in October.
•  CONTEXT: The Decarbonization Support Organization Corporation supports services/products
that have been commercialized, or nearly commercialized, which is different from METI’s Green
Innovation Fund for developing new technologies. Japan NRG wrote about the new entity in
detail in the July 13, 2022 issue.




Ex-METI Katayama Hiromu named Nuclear Regulation Authority chief
(Japan NRG, July 4)
•  Former METI official Katayama Hiromu was named Nuclear Regulation Authority secretary general,
replacing Ogino Toru. Katayama was deputy NRA secretary general and was a METI nuclear policy
official. He was involved in combating the 2011 Fukushima disaster as a member of the Emergency
Response Center.

•  CONTEXT: Katayama and his two deputies are from METI, leading some to argue that NRA will
now ease safety regulations. Katayama refuted the claims, saying it was purely a coincidence.



Car battery makers to measure carbon footprint of supply chains
(Japan NRG, July 7)
•  METI will launch a pilot project to measure and collect carbon footprint data of car batteries. The

project will run from August to February next year. The scope of measurement is raw materials,
battery production, logistics and consumption, but not recycling. Recycled material will comprise
raw materials. The carbon footprint of materials discarded in the production process will also be
counted. The goal is to measure and trace the carbon footprint of EV batteries, but smaller
batteries on hybrid vehicles can be included.
•  CONTEXT: European carbon footprint initiatives are pushing Japan’s automotive and battery
sectors, urging METI to make the study as expansive as possible to show Japanese battery

products are compatible with European regulations.



Battery Supply Chain Council urges commoditization of “black mass”
(Japan NRG, July 7)
•  The Battery Supply Chain Council developing battery standards is urging METI to help
commoditize “black mass”, a compound recovered from used lithium-ion batteries.
•  “Black mass” comprises nickel, cobalt and some manganese and lithium, and is generated after

heating battery scrap. It’s traded locally, though in small volumes, due to an absence of cost-
effective technologies to extract the elements from the compound. A technological breakthrough

would increase demand for “black mass” and attract supply. Japan needs to establish standards so
that “black mass” could trade in the open market like nickel and cobalt, said the Council’s
managing director Morishima Ryuta.
• TAKEAWAY: Volume and pricing issues must be resolved to realize a robust “black mass” market. Due to low
EV sales in Japan, several more years are needed until there is sufficient scrap battery to recover “black mass”

of several hundred tons per year. “Black mass” follows nickel and cobalt in terms of price, but the position of
the London Metal Exchange as their price benchmark has become unstable.



JFE turns food waste into electricity
(Gas Energy News, July 6)
•  JFE Engineering’s subsidiary, Shindenryoku Urban Energy, began generating electricity from hotel
food waste, using a biogas generator.
•  The electricity is purchased by the hotel, thus helping to keep its electricity footprint carbon
neutral.

power stations.


Change to wind tender rules could hamper competition: Opinion
(Nikkei X-Tech, July 4)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by staff writer Tanigawa Hiroto
•  The government proposed changing the rules that govern awarding tenders for offshore wind

farms. In the future, preference is likely to be given to bidders that complete environmental
assessments earlier.
•  However, this could penalize later entrants, thereby suppressing competition and increasing the
cost of electricity.
•  The proposed change is in response to the fact that all projects in recent tenders went to consortia
led by Mitsubishi Corp.

Japan’s Budget for CO2 Offsets from Overseas Projects
Jumps by Almost a Fifth

Japan is expanding its financial aid for overseas projects that cut emissions, hoping to
secure even more credits from reducing CO2 volumes via bilateral agreements.

The government has increased this year’s funding for the Joint Crediting Mechanism
(JCM) by close to a fifth to around ¥13.5 billion. The Mechanism allows Japan to
support renewable energy and power conservation projects conducted by its
companies in JCM-participating nations and claim part of the CO2 reduction as its
own.

The scheme has gained in importance in recent years as Japan has set more
aggressive emission reduction targets for this decade to align with the pledges of
other advanced economies.

According to Japan NRG calculations, the JCM scheme alone could account for a fifth
to a quarter of the CO2 volumes the nation has vowed to eliminate by 2030. JCM also
plays the role in supporting Japanese government’s commitment to help developing
Asian and other economies move towards net-zero.

JCM’s Operating Scheme

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Background
JCM is a way for Japan to help provide developing countries with low-carbon
technologies, products, systems, services, infrastructure, and other measures and
solutions. The funding applies to projects in solar, hydropower, and geothermal
energy, among others, as well as the installation of equipment to improve power
efficiency. JCM covers IPP, PPA and other business models. Other initiatives in energy
conservation are also being considered.

Meanwhile, Japan measures the GHG reductions achieved through the JCM-financed
projects and counts them towards its own national emission cuts.

The scheme is in line with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and, according to the MoE,
contributes to the objective of the UNFCCC by facilitating global actions for GHG
emission reductions or removals.

Japan estimates the potential for JCM to eliminate between 50 million tons of CO2
and 100 million tons of CO2 by 2030.

So far, 17 countries have signed bilateral agreements with Japan around JCM
programs. These are (in order of joining the JCM): Mongolia, Bangladesh, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Maldives, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, Costa Rica, Palau, Cambodia, Mexico,
Saudi Arabia, Chile, Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines.

The JCM is managed and operated by a joint committee consisting of representatives
from both countries. As of late September 2021, a total of 203 JCM-funded projects
have been adopted.


Speeding up the funding
By September 2021, the JCM committee had selected 30 projects over two
application rounds for funding. Of those, 26 were in Asia. In comparison, for the
whole of the prior fiscal year 2020, only 22 Asian projects got the go-ahead.

With more projects being accepted, the funding commitments are rising. This fiscal
year 2022, the budget for the JCM program was set at around ¥13.5 billion yen, an
increase of about ¥2.11 billion, or 19% from FY2021. The budget was confirmed in
March 2022, lending further support to Prime Minister Kishida’s pledge to bolster
support for Asian energy transition initiatives.

The FY2022 first round of applications closed in mid-May.
Among the recently approved projects are plans by Kanematsu KGK and Thailand’s
Blue Solar to install 35 MW of solar power generation and a 36 MWh energy storage
system in the Thai Suphan Buri Province. It is the first of the JCM projects to support
storage batteries in the Southeast Asian country.

The project will start to supply 44 GWh of electricity per year to the Thai national
power utility, EGATT, from December 2022. It’s estimated to cut GHG emissions by
around 13,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year.

Kanematsu KGK, a machinery sales subsidiary in the general trading group
Kanematsu, is a regular participator in JCM since 2018. It previously won funding for a
solar power and high-efficiency refrigeration system for a food factory in Thailand, and

14


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

also a 49 MW solar PV project in Vietnam’s An Giang province.

The Japanese firm’s four JCM projects are estimated to have removed 66,000 tons of
CO2 equivalent in emissions.


Thai leasing scheme
Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Lease's local subsidiary in Thailand is applying the JCM
scheme in another way. The unit is leasing solar power equipment to Japanese
building materials retailer LIXIL's production sites in Thailand.

SMFL Leasing (Thailand) helped LIXIL install rooftop solar at LIXIL’s Tostem Thai
facility, helping to cut CO2 by approximately 2,200 tons per year.

Rooftop solar installations feature frequently among JCM’s projects. Kansai Electric
recently claimed funding to help supply electricity to Lotte Vietnam after installing
1.25 MW capacity in PV panels on the roof of the latter’s factory. Construction is due
to be completed this summer with Lotte committing to buy electricity on a 20-year
contract. The project claims it will cut CO2 by 1,300 tons of CO2 equivalent a year.
The Kansai power utility even set up a special Vietnam entity to facilitate the project.


Hydropower in Indonesia
Nix Co., a Japanese infrastructure developer, is using JCM to help finance a 6.2 MW
mini hydropower project in Indonesia's West Sumatra Province, which is scheduled to
start operation around October 2022. The project is expected to reduce GHG
emissions by 18,319 tons per year.
The hydropower project was being developed independently by an Indonesian
company since 2013, but ran into technical and financial problems. Nix saw a chance
to step in and revive the stalled project, buying a 75% stake in the project entity in
late 2019 and then working to secure JCM funding.

The Japanese firm has added 3D and 4D modeling to simulate the construction and
improve on the design and project management.


Conclusion
In recent decades, many Japanese manufacturers have offshored their production
facilities to Southeast Asia, a trend that has only escalated since the onset of the
Covid-19 pandemic as companies look to secure their supply chains.

This means a significant number of Japanese companies are now looking at energy
improvements at their overseas assets and schemes like the JCM motivate them to
invest in better emissions and power conservation.

Naturally, most of these projects are small in scale, as described above. Yet added
together, they carry a notable CO2 reduction potential. At the current pace, it seems
improbably that Japan will secure the 50-100 million tons of CO2 emissions cuts
through JCM before 2030, but the expansion of the government’s budget allocation
indicates it is willing to promote the scheme more widely and accelerate its adoption.

Abe’s Energy Legacy:
Focus on Security, but Paved the Way for Net-Zero

After the shocking assassination of former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo last Friday, July
8, in the western Japanese city of Nara (see the News section for details), Japan NRG
Weekly pays tribute to his legacy and reviews his impact on the country’s energy
sector.

Abe was often described as a politician who didn’t much care about the energy
industry. If that was truly the case, then he nevertheless achieved a great deal.

During his time in power, Abe invested most of his political capital into changing
Japan’s monetary and fiscal course, as well as on a series of reforms in free trade, the
stock market, corporate governance, agriculture and tourism, just to name a few. He
rarely tackled the big energy issues in public speeches.

Still, when taking over for his second stint as PM at the end of 2012, about 20 months
after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Abe maintained the course set by his political
opponents in terms of supporting the wider rollout of renewable energy and
shepherding the power and gas markets toward full liberalization.

Critics point to delays in liberalization as evidence that Abe favored the major utilities
against industry newcomers, and paid too much lip service to blue chip firms. And yet,
the opening up of these key sectors to greater competition was consistent with Abe’s
broader free-trade and competition agenda. Furthermore, enacting change in the
energy sector often tends to take longer than planned.

In contrast, the big power companies had cause for dissatisfaction with Abe’s
leadership as he rarely voiced support for the nuclear industry. Abe was an astute
reader of the public mood and, sensing strong anti-nuclear sentiment, he kept his
stance low key for most of his second term in office (Dec. 2012 to Sept. 2020) – the
longest for any Japanese PM. Then, within a year of leaving office, he went on to chair
or advise groups that advocated for new nuclear plants.

For Abe, nuclear power represented both energy security and CO2-free electricity.
The latter idea is rarely if ever credited to Abe. The plaudits go to his successor, Suga,
who officially set Japan on a net-zero course in an October 2020 speech. Yet, Suga’s
declaration was made just one month after Abe stepped down.

In fact, the plan to decarbonize Japan was set in motion during Abe’s time as PM, but
was paused. Abe hesitated, since in the summer of 2020 he faced political scandals
and failing health. He feared the onset of the Covid pandemic meant that Japan’s
businesses and society would not accept a strong green message. By the time Suga
decided to make the declaration, he had the benefit of having seen industrial rival
China announce the same.

Abe’s penchant for viewing most issues via a security lens is also likely the reason for
his well-publicized attempts to court an official peace treaty with Russia. Abe and

President Vladimir Putin met at least 25 times and held about 10 official phone calls.
After Russia’s sudden annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014, Japan’s
sanctions were criticized as soft compared to those of western allies.

Japan relies on six countries in the Middle East for 93% of its crude oil, which is about
40-45% of the primary energy mix. Russia was considered a viable alternative for oil,
natural gas, and other commodities, but geopolitical and governance issues made it a
difficult investment destination for Japanese firms.

In return for Abe’s diplomatic efforts, Japan was considered a front-runner to help
develop a new LNG project near Vladivostok or expand its Sakhalin oil and gas
projects in Russia. While those plans did not proceed, Japan Oil, Gas, and Metals
Corporation (JOGMEC) and Mitsui & Co. eventually took a 10% stake in the Russian
Arctic LNG 2 project. Notably, the Japanese investment occurred after two Chinese
companies bought in.

In the context of today, Abe’s efforts towards Russia are interpreted as a failure. The
future of Japanese energy assets in Russia are highly uncertain. The breadth of Abe’s
international relationship-building, however, means that some of what he sowed will
surely result in a long-term gain. Japan’s close energy dialog with India and the
ASEAN, and better engagement with Africa, are just a few of the green shoots to look
out for in the future.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ Economic stimulus
Good news for the global economy. China intends to move forward the sale of about
$220 billion in state bonds for the second half of 2022 (originally planned for 2023) in
order to bolster fiscal stimulus and keep the economy on target for growth forecasts.

China/ EV Batteries
Tianqi Lithium, a supplier of components used in rechargeable batteries, held a
secondary listing in Hong Kong. Bolstered by growing EV sales, the company raised
$1.7 billion to fund expansion. The company debuted on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange in 2010.

EU/ Nuclear power and Gas
The EU approved a law classifying gas and nuclear as “sustainable energy sources”,
which is in large part seen as a move to help end reliance on Russian gas supplies.
Member states have until July 11 to object, but officials said it’s unlikely to be
blocked.

France/ Nuclear power
The government will take full control of EDF, a nuclear energy power group that is
grappling with high debt and production outages. The company also must process its
biggest orders in decades for new nuclear reactors.
India/ Oil
The government imposed special taxes on petrol and diesel exports, accusing oil
refiners of cashing in on high international prices while “drying out their pumps” at
home. India’s biggest private refiners include Reliance Industries and the partly
Rosneft-owned Nayara Energy, both of which are buying discounted Russian crude.

Indonesia/ Oil
State-owned Pertamina and Russia's Rosneft will invest $22 billion in a refinery in East
Java, as well as other projects to produce fuel and raw materials for the country.

Mexico/ Oil
State-owned Pemex opened its vast Dos Bocas refinery. Originally expected to cost
$8 billion, it's far over budget, now at about $12 billion. Dos Bocas is projected to
produce 340,000 barrels daily.

Qatar/ LNG
In recent weeks, QatarEnergy announced JVs with five major international energy
companies to develop the $29 billion North Field East. By 2026, Qatar’s annual LNG
export capacity will increase from 77 million tons to 110 million tons, overtaking
Australia as the second-biggest gas producer and only lagging behind the U.S.

Russia/ Metals
Metals giant Norilsk Nickel began talks with aluminum producer Rusal to create a $60
billion metals production behemoth that will be better positioned to withstand the
impact of western sanctions on Russia.

Switzerland/ battery storage
A water battery that can store electricity equivalent to 400,000 electric car batteries
began operating in Valais. With the ability to store and generate large amounts of
hydroelectric energy, the battery will help stabilize power supplies in the country.

UK/ Energy transition
National Grid presented plans for a £54 billion upgrade to the national electricity
network. It wants 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030, up from 10 GW currently and the
new network would have capacity for an additional 23 GW. At full output this would
meet about 67% of total electricity demand.
