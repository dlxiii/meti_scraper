NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


General election energy policies of main parties

(Alterna, Oct. 8)
•  CONTEXT: Ahead of the October 31 general election, Alterna conducted a survey of major
political parties (LDP, Komeito, Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), Japan Restoration Party
(Nippon Ishin no Kai), and the Japan Communist Party) to gather their stand on energy and
environmental issues.
•  On lowering GHG emissions by FY2030 (compared with FY2013 levels):
LDP – by 46%

Komeito – by 46%
CDP – by 55% or more
Japan Restoration – 100% by 2050
Communists – by 54% to 63%
•  On the energy mix by FY2030
LDP: RE – 36%-38%; Nuclear – 20%-22%; Coal – 19%; Other fossil fuels – 22%; Hydrogen – 1%
Komeito: same as above but with emphasis on researching how to get the RE component higher

than 38%
CDP: RE – 50%, other (mainly LNG) – 50%; phase out nuclear
Japan Restoration: a realistic scenario that does not lead to industry going elsewhere
Communists: CDP: RE – 50%, fossil fuels (mainly LNG) – 50%; nuclear and coal at 0
•  All parties agree on the need for carbon pricing.
•  LDP is the most positive on the impact from energy efficiency.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan’s big business lobby calls for both renewables and nuclear utilization
(Kankyo Business, Oct. 11)
o  The Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) issued a public comment
on the draft of the 6th Basic Energy Plan, stating that the government should "clearly
state it will work to introduce the maximum amount of renewable energy to make it a
main power source, based on the basic premise of S+3E,” while also bringing down the

cost of renewables to European and U.S. levels.
o  The Keidanren also advocated building nuclear power plants to replace current aging
reactors and altogether new nuclear power plants, as well as for more efforts to be made
on decarbonized fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia.
o  The group praised the balanced, portfolio approach of the current Plan, but noted that it
lacks concrete measures to deal with rising energy costs and issues related to stable
supply of energy.

• TAKEAWAY: All the political parties show strong support for renewables, which should assuage some of the
doubts around the country’s direction on the issue. The energy strategies of the opposition are less clear, but
it is interesting that all of them seem to support a strong reliance on LNG, something that the new Basic
Energy Plan seems to repeal. In this case, it feels like politics are not in line with policies.

•  The nine-month high comes after a recent run up in power prices to reflect the high fossil fuel
prices around the world.
•  While most of Japan’s LNG, coal and oil is purchased on long-term contracts, many of those reflect

to a degree the global prices for the commodities, albeit with a lag. Utilities also purchase some
cargos of the fuel on the spot market to adjust to their demand and weather conditions.
•  So far, the rally in electricity prices in Japan has been sporadic rather than linear. The jump on Oct.
12 was followed by a drop off in the following week.
•  JEPX prices are down WoW for the last five days.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Fear of power shortage for this winter with no resolution for the rising LNG price
(Senkaku, October 2021 edition)
o  Major power companies are saying that “this winter won’t be that harsh” but the power
demand and supply for this winter is in trouble. If demand is higher than expected, most
likely stock will run short.
o  LNG fills the gap if Japanese power demand is higher than supply. During the last harsh
winter, LNG was short, and prices shot up.

o  Major power utilities have no choice but to purchase LNG even if the price goes up to
secure supply. They blame new market entrants for a lack of balance in the system, but
the latter blame the utilities for poor planning, especially with maintenance schedules.
o  The METI is not fond of issuing power saving demands, which inconvenience citizens, so
this is a measure of last resort.
o  Japan is facing another winter without sufficient power reserve.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Tohoku Electric shuts down oil-fired station for heavy maintenance
(Niikei, Oct. 12)
o  Tohoku Electric is conducting a major overhaul and inspection of its Higashi-Niigata
thermal power plant in anticipation of an electricity demand surge in midwinter.
• TAKEAWAY: The January price spike still prey on the minds of many in the industry and METI. It’s early in the
winter season to judge whether the winter of 2020/2021 will repeat itself. However, near-term weather

forecasts (see the Weather section) suggest milder temperatures will soon return for the rest of this month.

Japan’s output of lumber jumps to 48-year high on biomass expansion
(Asia Nikkei, Oct. 10)
•  Japan last year used its highest rate of domestically produced lumber since 1972 to meet demand
from the country’s growing biomass power sector.

•  Total Japanese lumber production increased 0.5% in 2020 to 31.15 million cubic meters. In the
same year, production of wood fuel, including for biomass power plants, increased 28.8% in to
8.93 million cubic meters. Supply of imported timber fell 15%.
•  The domestic wood industry association says more lumber demand is needed to promote the
cycle between planting trees and utilizing them.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Aging forests likely to hinder Japan's decarbonization efforts
(Asia Nikkei, Oct. 15)
o  Old trees detract from disaster prevention and CO2 absorption effects
o  Japan's Forestry Agency estimates that the absorption of carbon dioxide by forests in
Japan reached a recent peak of 52 million tons in fiscal 2014 and dropped about 20% to
43 million tons in fiscal 2019.
o  The absorption of carbon dioxide is considered to hit a ceiling when the growth of trees

stabilizes after they become older than 40 years.



Goldman helps ENEOS with unit strategy to win a high bid for JRE
(Senkaku, October 2021 edition)
•  CONTEXT: This is a magazine article that purports to offer insights on how ENEOS emerged as the
winner on the recent bidding for Japan Renewable Energy, a solar and wind developer started by
and largely owned by Goldman Sachs. ENEOS said last week that it completed the deal to buy JRE
from current owners including Goldman Sachs for about ¥200 billion.
•  ENEOS seeks to delist construction subsidiary NIPPO Corp using a complex scheme that would

allow it to retain control.
•  ENEOS has said it will tie up with Goldman Sachs to delist NIPPO. Goldman will purchase shares
via a tender offer from minority shareholders. Then ENEOS will sell its shares to NIPPO, but
maintain its position as the parent company by investing in a special-purpose company owned by
Goldman.
•  The deal structure should help ENEOS earn ¥170 billion. An oversea securities executive says that

“this is a part of a backdoor deal” that also involves Japan Renewable Energy.
•  Toyota and ENEOS were the main candidates for JRE, but Toyota was due to withdraw from the
process. Goldman wanted to make ensure ENEOS would will buy JRE for a fair price, despite
Toyota’s exit, and therefore assisted ENEOS with the NIPPO situation.

Companies look for creative solutions to get license to build more solar
(Mainichi Shimbun, Oct. 12)
•  Solar farms are gaining a reputation as a nuisance in some parts of the country because they create
visual pollution and encourage deforestation.
•  Some businesses are attempting to change this by partnering with local bodies to find sites where

solar farms can have a positive impact. In Kyoto, for example, Kyocera partners with local
construction companies to cover unused agricultural land with photovoltaic panels, making it more
difficult for wild boars to cause damage.

LDP Chief Amari advocates small modular reactors
(Nikkei, Oct 12)
•  In an interview, LDP Secretary General Amari Akira advocated replacing Japan’s aging nuclear
reactors with small modular reactors (SMRs).
•  While SMR technology is still under development, the reactors are said to be safer, and take less

time to construct than conventional reactors.
•  Amari said if Japan is to rely on nuclear energy for a portion of its electricity supply, then it needs
to entertain the idea of replacing existing reactors with more advanced technology.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE


Japan’s upstream oil and gas firms reluctantly ponder net-zero

While European oil firms are going for ‘green’ full steam ahead, and their American
counterparts are aiming for a milder ‘blue’, Japanese oil companies still aren’t certain
about the ‘color’ of their energy transition.

The net-zero debate amongst most fossil fuel energy giants appears pretty much
been settled, but the conversation in Japan’s oil and gas sector remains muted. Many
in the industry believe that holding onto hydrocarbon resources is the best approach,
regardless of trends elsewhere.

Nevertheless, Japanese companies need to accept and observe the country’s new
carbon neutrality law, even if there’s a lack of clarity about the details. As it stands,
many in Japan’s oil and gas sector, which is led by several state-backed companies,
wonder in which direction they should pivot (if at all) amid the seemingly contradictory
national security objectives.

This has led to mixed messages, in both strategies and actions, from Japanese
upstream firms. They are also paying close attention to U.S. energy giants, waiting to
see whether they’ll carve out a new course in the energy transition, or eventually
succumb to their European peers’ renewables-first environmental agenda.


Regulatory framework shapes climate strategies
Strategies are often impacted by local regulatory frameworks. For example, European
energy firms seek to present themselves as carbon neutrality leaders partly because
the European Council very much wants to assume leadership in international climate-
related policymaking.

On the surface, Japan’s upstream firms have made similar strides. Between January
and May 2021, Idemitsu, Japan Petroleum Exploration (JAPEX), Inpex, Cosmo Oil, Fuji
Oil, and Osaka Gas announced carbon neutrality goals. Most of these
announcements, however, paint only a general outline of direction toward a goal
almost three decades away.

The vagueness owes something to the policy and legal framework in Japan. The
country recently wrote the national 2050 carbon neutrality commitment into an
existing law, and the amendments to Global Warming Countermeasures Act won
Parliament approval on May 26, 2021. However, those changes take effect only in
April 2022, nine months after the Climate Law enforcement in the EU in July 2021.

The delay and the ambiguous legal environment have convinced Japanese oil and gas
companies simultaneously to hold onto most fossil fuel resources but also launch
projects around carbon capture and a few in renewables.

JAPEX sold out of Canadian oil sands at a loss of more than $800 million earlier in the
year, then joined a $100 million fund that invests in solar power in Japan and a

Inpex last week announced its exit from a heavy crude project in Venezuela and has
committed to investing in renewable energy projects after raising ¥10 billion (~$88
million) in its inaugural green bonds. But the company’s biggest earners remain the
LNG and gas-related projects.

Many upstream firms in Japan are curious to see what direction the U.S. peers will
take. The country still has no overarching climate law and, thus, major players are
experimenting with different approaches. ExxonMobil’s focus is on carbon capture,
utilization and storage, hydrogen and biofuels, but not on solar or wind power.
Chevron is diversifying into solar, offshore wind, geothermal, biomass and biofuels.

The proposed CLEAN Future Act, as well as the growing power of climate activist
investors, may steer U.S. upstream companies in yet other directions.

| In Europe, Climate Law debates intensified in 2019, and major oil and gas companies |
| quickly fell into line. In December 2019, Repsol pledged carbon neutrality, followed |
| by BP in February 2020; Royal Dutch Shell in April, and Total in May and ENI in May |
| 2021. The law finally passed in June 2021. |

ExxonMobil supports net zero by 2050, but its reduction targets are for 2025: to slash
upstream emissions by 15-20%; methane by 40-50%; and flaring by 35-45%.

Chevron’s reduction goals for 2028 are — 40% GHG cuts for oil, 26% for gas and 53%
for methane, all from 2016 levels. NextEra Energy plans to cut carbon emissions 67%
by 2025 from an adjusted 2005 baseline. Duke Energy said as early as September
2019 that it was aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050.


Different impacts of laws
The impact of the new laws in Japan and the EU varies, and company behavior
reflects that.

A number of European energy majors said they are proactively working with all
stakeholders to shift to greener energy and advocate net zero policies to business
partners and customers. The action suggest European firms may become relatively
minor players in fossil fuels as soon as 10-15 years from now.

Japanese upstream firms are less sure that heading for the exit on fossil fuels is the
right way to go and their commitments to carbon neutrality are more modest than
those made in Europe. What’s more, the companies do not see it as their sole
responsibility to respond to the decarbonization trend, instead describing it as a
collective effort between national government, municipalities, and the private sector.

Incidentally, the collective approach is written into the second article of the amended
Global Warming Countermeasures Act as the law’s basic objective.

“We don’t aim to completely shift away from oil and gas, but we aim to achieve a
carbon neutral society through CCUS and other technologies,” JAPEX said in a
statement. INPEX said it believes the energy transition will be driven by developing
innovation and new business models to meet customer needs.

In short, the top two Japanese oil and gas exploration companies remain committed
to future fossil fuel supplies. And looking at some of Japan’s other national targets,
that makes sense.

Despite the commitment to phase out sales of new vehicles with combustion engines
after 2035 and emissions cuts, the Japanese government has kept in place a goal of
the country being 40% self-sufficient in oil and gas by 2030. In 2016, that ratio was
27.4%, which suggests more investment is needed not less.

Where the strategies of Japanese upstream firms will likely change is the nature of the
oil and gas assets they target. The portfolios may rebalance away from hydrocarbon
projects with high CO2 content to those with less or with a strong “carbon neutral”
element. The latter may be achieved through the installation of carbon capture or
offsets, or both.

In the meantime, the upstream firms will hope that their project management know-
how and, importantly, their exploration technologies can be leveraged for
wind, geothermal and biomass power generation. How much the Japanese regulatory
framework pushes them to get serious about renewables remains to be seen.

ANALYSIS

BY TIM DAISS
Vietnam’s LNG Green Shoots Give Hope for
Japan’s industry and Geopolitics

Japan may have lost its position as the biggest LNG importer to China, but
opportunities in Vietnam showcase how the country will likely retain its leading role in
the industry.

Over the past year, several Japanese firms signed deals cumulatively worth close to
$9 billion to invest in Vietnam’s LNG and LNG-to-power sector.

As well as providing technology and financing for gas-based energy systems in a
region where coal is still king, Japan is playing a pivotal geopolitical role in helping
Vietnam and other Southeast Asian economies offset China’s growing hegemony.

Ideally, Vietnam would rely on local gas fields and spend less on the billion-dollar
LNG infrastructure it's currently planning. However, due to territorial conflicts, the full
rollout of LNG could help Vietnam avoid regional tensions while building energy ties
with Japan and other allies based on shared security needs.


The big naval standoff over gas
As of today, Vietnam has no LNG infrastructure in operation. Even though the country
relies on natural gas for about 1/6th of its energy mix, supply has traditionally come
from domestic gas fields. By the middle of this decade, however, that supply is
expected to wane.

Exploration for new gas fields has proved a challenge. At least twice in the past three
years, state-run PetroVietnam and its foreign partners have been forced by China to
stop exploring for gas off Vietnam’s coast as vessels from Asia’s biggest nation stared
down that of their neighbors, threatening action. Beijing claims the waters as its own,
even though the offshore gas resources sit within Vietnam’s UN-mandated 200-
nautical mile exclusive economic zone.

Beyond a political backlash,
this has created a growing
energy crunch for Vietnam.
The country already relies on
coal for more than half its
energy supply and is forecast
to face brownouts and rolling
blackouts due to gas
shortages, mostly in its more
populous southern region.

While the Covid-19 pandemic
temporarily put the issue on
pause due to lockdowns, the
reopening of Vietnam’s
economy threatens to strain

the power system and put a lock on further economic growth.

That’s why Vietnam started planning for future gas supply that won’t have to depend
on offshore fields. The country’s first LNG import terminal is due for completion as
early as 2023.

That’s just the start. Vietnam has as many as 22 approved LNG-to-power project
proposals of varying sizes, which will be included in the Power Development Plan VIII
2021-2030 due to be finalized and published later this year.

For such a large LNG-fired system, Vietnam will need to create strong infrastructure
and this is where many Japanese firms have started to invest.

Standout Deals
•  Tokyo Gas and trading house Marubeni signed a MoU to build an LNG regasification
terminal and a 1,500 MW capacity LNG-fired power plant in Vietnam’s northern
province of Quang Ninh, some 200 kilometers northeast of Hanoi. Total project cost:
about ¥212 billion (~$2 billion).

•  Under another MoU, Marubeni will invest ¥143 billion in the O Mon 2 combined cycle
gas turbine plant in Vietnam’s southern city of Can Tho in the Mekong Delta. The
developers hope to raise 80% of total investment from loans secured by the Japan
Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Nippon Export and Investment Insurance
(NEXI), and Asian Development Bank (ADB).

•  JERA, Japan’s top utility and world’s largest LNG buyer, is tying up with ExxonMobil
to invest ¥550 billion to build a large-scale LNG import terminal and adjacent gas-
fired power station at Haiphong, a coastal city 80 kilometers north of Hanoi.


Mixed messages
Despite losing its status as the world’s biggest LNG importer to China this year,
Japan’s plans for Vietnamese investments play a key regional role, one that is
recognized by its allies. In fact, JERA’s project with Exxon is described by the
companies as being part of the Japan-U.S. Strategic Energy Partnership, which
supports energy access and investments for sustainable economic development and
energy security.

Earlier this month, the U.S. and Japan were also involved in setting up of another
regional energy initiative, this time in concert with Australia and South Korea. The
private sector-led Asia Natural Gas and Energy Association (ANGEA) was touted by
METI officials as a way for the four countries to share their knowledge of LNG,
renewables and conservation with other Asian governments to help accelerate their
energy transition.

The ambivalent status of LNG in the U.S. since the arrival of President Biden’s
administration, however, has also set off mixed messages. Despite ongoing work
around that Japan-U.S. Strategic Energy Partnership, before an Aug. 31 meeting with
then Prime Minister Suga U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry told media that Japan
should not be promoting LNG in Southeast Asia, but instead focus on renewable
energy.

How realistic or welcome Kerry’s message will be in Tokyo or Hanoi remains to be seen.


Competition for new ground
Of course, Japan is not the only player vying for Vietnam LNG contracts. South
Korean firms offer stiff competition, and U.S. companies also are trying to strike more
LNG deals in Vietnam.

The deeper issue for all overseas players is the as-yet uncertain regulation, which
together with other local market obstacles could “separate enthusiastic LNG project
sponsors from the finish line,” said Thu Vu, an energy finance analyst with the Institute
for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Simply put, since LNG is still a fledgling sector in Vietnam a fully developed regulatory
system is not in place. Some current laws set out basic principles in the country’s oil
and gas sector, while LNG itself is addressed only in imprecise pieces of legislation
and governmental policy and decree. This results in varying interpretations by the
judiciary, the prime minister’s office and other governmental agencies.

Firms entering Vietnam not only have to navigate complicated approval processes on
the national level, but also on the provincial level where authorities have the power to
postpone, or even cancel project proposals at their whim. Japanese firms, however,
seem familiar with Vietnam’s existing framework of older laws and precedents to
encourage private investment as well as its risk allocation structure.

Nonetheless, prime ministerial intervention remains a critical step in order to put
together and flesh out existing laws. Due to recent increases in approved LNG-to-
power project proposals in the country, the need for a more developed regulatory
framework is gaining momentum.

The danger for foreign investors is that state-run energy companies, including
PetroVietnam, its subsidiary PVGas, EVN (Vietnam’s largest power company) and
others, could push back in order to stick to existing policy and decree. Maintaining
the status quo helps these state-run players retain both political and even operational
control in some cases.

In January, Hanoi finally implemented a new Public Private Partnership law designed
to attract more foreign investment in its LNG sector. However, it didn’t add to the
existing legal framework, but merely tried to clarify it.

Going forward, Japanese energy firms will continue investing across the LNG value
chain not only in Vietnam but also in most of Southeast Asia, especially as they
engage in more secondary LNG trading and on the spot market to take advantage of
inflated prices.

The recent rally in global gas and LNG prices remains a worry not only for Japan, but
for Vietnam and all regional players. Also, it might dampen enthusiasm from
Southeast Asian governments, thus delaying Vietnam’s LNG ambitions more than any
lack of legal clarities.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Energy transition/ Energy crisis
Clean energy investment must triple in the next decade in order to avoid high
volatility in global energy markets, said Fatih Birol, International Energy Agency
director. While current investment in oil and gas does correspond with net zero GHG
emission goals, renewable energy investment is only at a third of the required level.
This year, annual global energy investment will be $1.9 trillion, but only $370 billion
will be spent on new sources of renewable power. "The longer this persists, the
greater the risk of further sharp price swings and increased volatility,” said Birol.

ESG/ Finance
Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor and now head of ESG and impact
investing at Brookfield Asset Management, said he faces resistance to his efforts to
end financing of new oil, gas and coal exploration projects. Many banks prefer targets
based on research by the United Nation’s International Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), which is not binding and allows continued fossil fuel financing. In April, Carney
set up the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which is supported by about 300
financial institutions with assets of $90 trillion.

ESG/ Finance
Billionaire hedge fund manager Chris Hohn excoriated the financial industry over its
support of fossil fuels. Co-founder of the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation,
Hohn sent a proposal to the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the
European Banking Authority and the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council to
establish stricter capital requirements for carbon-intensive lending, and to require
banks to improve climate-related disclosures.

Europe/ Energy crisis
CEOs of major European utilities, such as Enel, Orsted, Vattenfal and EDP, appealed
to EU governments to avoid “short-sighted political measures” such as Spain’s
windfall tax on utilities, which they claim violates EU law. About 20 EU states have
emergency plans to mitigate the social cost of high energy prices, such as temporary
tax cuts and subsidies to poor households. However, except for Spain, no member
state has yet imposed profit tax on utilities.

South Korea/ Hydrogen
One of the world's leading automative parts companies, Hyundai Mobis, will invest
$1.1 billion to build two factories in Korea for hydrogen fuel cell production — one in
the city of Incheon and the other in Ulsan. Mass production is scheduled to begin in
2023, and once fully operational annual production is estimated at 100,000 hydrogen
fuel cells. Hyundai Mobis is a subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Group.
Netherlands/ Coal and Nuclear

The country will exit coal power by 2030, and nuclear power by 2033. In the midterm,
by 2025, the Netherlands will reduce coal-fired energy capacity to 3.2 GW. By 2030
the goal is to reduce GHG emissions 49% compared to 1990 levels by heavily

| by 2025, the Netherlands will reduce coal-fired energy capacity to 3.2 GW. By 2030 |
| the goal is to reduce GHG emissions 49% compared to 1990 levels by heavily |

penalizing GHG emitters. Meanwhile, biopower capacity will increase almost
threefold, from 1.2 GW today to 3.1 GW by 2030. The Netherland's last remaining
nuclear reactor, with 482 MW of capacity, will shutter by 2033.

Russia/ Gas
With the Arctic warming rapidly, President Vladimir Putin said his country will aim for
carbon neutrality by 2060, adding that natural gas, hydrogen and ammonia will play a
greater role in the country’s energy mix. He also denied accusations of Russia
deliberately limiting gas supplies to Europe to drive up prices, and said Moscow is
meeting all requests for gas supplies. He urged European customers to sign long-term
contracts — for two decades or more — to secure additional gas supplies, rather than
buy via spot markets.

Steel/ Energy crisis
ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, halted production at some plants due to
soaring energy costs. The company felt forced to implement “short selective
production pauses” at some electric arc furnaces, but said this won’t impact
production volumes and its ability to meet demand. ArcelorMittal annually produces
about 40 million tons of steel in Europe, a quarter of which goes to the construction
industry.

UK/ Energy efficiency
Only about 13% of UK homeowners plan to improve home energy efficiency in the
next five years, according to the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group (EEIG), which
unites leading industry and consumer groups, think tanks, environmental NGOs, as
well as major engineering, energy and construction businesses. However, the EEIG
also said its research shows citizens will accept further government intervention, and
one possible solution is to give incentives to cheaply build more energy-efficient
homes with the help of new tax measures.

UK/ Hydrogen
Renewable Energy Systems and Octopus Energy, one of Britain’s largest energy
suppliers, will invest £3 billion in hydrogen plants in the UK by the end of the decade.
The companies will develop, own and operate hydrogen plants powered by
renewable energy. In related news, Protium said it will open a green hydrogen project
on Teesside in 2026, and this will include up to 40 MW of electrolysis capability,
developed in two phases, including hydrogen storage. The facility’s output will go to
local manufacturers.
