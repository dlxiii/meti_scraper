NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


Energy White Paper 2025 approved by Cabinet

(Government statement, June 13)
•  The Cabinet approved the FY2024 Annual Report on Energy, also known as the Energy White Paper
2025.
•  Data on domestic and international energy trends, previously included under Energy Trends until
last year, was excluded from this year’s White Paper. Instead, this content will now be published on
ANRE’s website.
•  The White Paper now has two parts:
o  Part 1: Current Energy Situation and Major Measures
o  Part 2: Status of Measures Taken for Energy Supply and Demand
•  Part 1 focuses on three key topics:
o  Progress in Fukushima’s reconstruction.
o  Japan’s efforts toward GX and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
o  Trends in carbon neutrality in major countries and regions.
•  Part 2 focuses on several crucial points related to energy security, supply, and markets with
particular emphasis on decarbonization, including:
o  Significantly expanding renewables, including ammonia and hydrogen.
o  Promoting structural reforms to reduce market barriers.
o  Strengthening cooperation for technology development and supply security.
•  Other key insights:
o  Despite improved conservation efforts, Japan’s energy usage is expected to rise from 806
TWh this year to 852.4 TWh by 2034; due to data centers and semiconductor factories.
▪  Therefore, emphasis is on development of six clean energies: photonics-electronics
convergence; perovskite solar power; offshore floating wind power; next-gen geothermal
power; next-gen nuclear reactors, and other alternatives like hydrogen or ammonia.
•  CONTEXT: The Annual Report on Energy (Energy White Paper) is submitted to the National Diet and
outlines govt measures for energy supply and demand.



METI and JERA discuss role of LNG in Japan at conference
(Japan NRG, June 20)
•  At the LNG Producer-Consumer Conference in Tokyo last week, Wakuda Hajime (METI’s head of
natural resources & fuel) spoke about the role of LNG in the 7th Strategic Energy Plan. Japan has a
2050 target for net-zero emissions, but Wakuda stressed that ensuring stable energy supply remains
a national priority.
•  Technologies such as hydrogen, ammonia, and CCS are part of the strategy. But, there are still
uncertainties surrounding large-scale deployment.
•  METI has five potential decarbonization scenarios. In the most pessimistic one, decarbonization
technologies fail to advance, making LNG an even more vital part of the energy mix. Under this
scenario, by 2040 Japan's LNG imports could increase from the current 66 Mtpa to 70 Mtpa or
more.
•  Wakuda noted that energy companies often need around 25 years to develop and operate major
LNG projects. To support them, the govt seeks greater transparency in the LNG market and is
encouraging firms to lock in long-term contracts.

•  Tsugaru Ryosuke (JERA senior MEO) said that while the spot market has grown, long-term
agreements are crucial again because they help to avoid price volatility and ensure a stable supply.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  JERA’s current LNG procurement is concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region (mostly in Australia and
Southeast Asia). Tsugaru emphasized the need to diversify supply sources in terms of geography,
with North America offering both the volumes and contract flexibility that Japanese buyers want.
•  Japan's electricity demand and supply have become more volatile due to the absence of oil-fired
power generation. This often makes LNG the only reliable option, said Tsugaru. To manage this
complexity, JERA seeks to optimize LNG flows on a global scale. JERA’s energy and trading hub in
Singapore plays a key role in this strategy.
•  Despite the focus on LNG, Tsugaru said JERA is committed to decarbonization, and pursuing a
balanced energy portfolio. This includes LNG, low-carbon fuels like hydrogen and ammonia, and
renewables.



LNG futures up nearly 10% amid concerns of shipment delays as Iran war intensifies
(Exchange data, various media reports, June 19)
•  As fighting between Israel and Iran intensifies, LNG and natural gas futures prices, along with crude
oil futures, have jumped.
•  On June 17, ICE Futures Europe’s August futures of Asia LNG spot price Platts JKM, which has a
high correlation with Japan's wholesale electricity market (JEPX) spot prices, closed at $14.04 (per
million BTU), surpassing $14 for the first time in about three months.
•  This marks a 9.2% increase compared to June 12’s close, just before Israel began airstrikes on Iran.
It's also 3% higher than the close on June 16.
•  JOGMEC interprets the rise in Platts JKM prices as primarily due to supply concerns for LNG
stemming from the Israel and Iran conflict.

•  CONTEXT: The IEA said that all LNG shipments from Qatar and UAE pass through the Strait of
Hormuz, and there are no alternative routes.
• TAKEAWAY: Shipments from these two countries account for around 20% of global LNG trade, with
approximately 80% destined for major Asian importers such as China and India, and the remaining 20% for the
EU market. Recent increases in JKM spot prices reflect market concerns over potential disruptions or delays to
LNG shipments amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. What’s more, about 95% of Japan’s oil
imports are sourced from the Middle East region.



METI director outlines hydrogen funding push beyond initial targets
(Japan NRG, June 19)
•  Japan aims to build a diversified hydrogen portfolio beyond the initial 3 Mtpa target set for 2030,
with Contract for Difference (CfD) subsidy proposals received already surpassing METI’s ¥3 trillion
budget, said Hirota Daisuke, head investment strategist for ANRE’s Hydrogen & Ammonia Division,
speaking at the Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition in Tokyo.
•  METI plans to announce successful "first mover" hydrogen projects in the second half of this fiscal
year, noting intense competition due to high demand for funding.
•  With a nod to inflationary pressures, Hirota said initial funding won’t foster the scale needed to
build robust hydrogen supply chains, prompting METI to suggest that suppliers also look at a second
support scheme (the LTDA). The latter is focused specifically on power-generation projects, covering
both capital and operating expenditures upstream.
•  Hirota stressed that Japan would take a careful approach to hydrogen-related regulations, avoiding
overly strict measures that could raise project costs.
•  Speaking on the same panel at the Japan Energy Summit, ENEOS Senior VP and CTO, Fujiyama
Yuichiro, echoed concerns on strict hydrogen safety regulations hindering market growth, urging

NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


Surging electricity demand drives up wholesale prices
(Denki Shimbun, June 19)
•  Amid scorching heat during a break in the rainy season from June 17–19, wholesale electricity
market prices trended upward.
•  The JEPX spot price for June 19 delivery peaked at ¥30.56/ kWh in West Japan between 6:00 p.m.
and 7:30 p.m. On that same day, the 24-hour system price average reached ¥14.42/kWh, the
highest since March.
•  On June 17, when supply-demand tightness was a concern, a power plant issue in West Japan
exacerbated the situation, leading to a sharp increase in trading in the intraday market during peak
hours.
•  With persistent heat, the 24-hour system price average rose to ¥14.14/ kWh on June 18, and
¥14.42/ kWh on June 19.
•  CONTEXT: Considering the risk of sudden power plant outages, there is reason for concern in the
supply-demand situation.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Intra-day market average price falls below ¥10 for first time in 13 months
(Denki Shimbun, June 16)
o  The average daily volume in May on JEPX’s intra-day market (時間前市場, also “hour-
ahead”) rose 7.2% MoM to 19.6 GWh, an increase after two months of decline.
o  During the latter half of Golden Week holidays (May 3–5), daily transaction volumes
exceeded 30 GWh, driven by active economic load dispatching amid increased power plant
outages for maintenance.
o  Clear weather boosted solar power generation, leading to lower prices. The monthly
average transaction price fell below ¥10 for the first time in 13 months (since April 2024)
reaching ¥9.83/ kWh.
o  The daily average number of transactions rose 8.9% to 8,524.
o  Monthly transaction volume grew 10.8% to 608.2 GWh, and the number of transactions

Tokyo and Chubu areas face tight supply-demand balance
(Denki Shimbun, June 19)
•  Amid intense heat during a break in the rainy season, electricity demand has surged.
•  Maximum power demand across all 10 areas reached 138 GW between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.,
surpassing the previous day’s monthly peak.
•  In particular, the Tokyo and Chubu areas were projected to have a wide-area reserve margin below
8%, prompting additional supply measures for the second consecutive day, including switching the
operation of pumped-storage power generation.
•  TEPCO Power Grid and Chubu Electric Power Grid took additional supply measures early due to
tight supply-demand conditions.
• TAKEAWAY: With summer near and many thermal power plants still facing maintenance or repairs, rising
temperatures and increased cooling demand appear to be the driving factors in the tight supply-demand

conditions.



Wheeling charges: ANRE proposes measures to reduce burden during construction
(Government statement, Denki Shimbun, June 16)
•  METI and ANRE proposed to increase the inclusion of construction work in progress (CWIP) in the
calculation of business compensation – for electricity transmission and distribution utilities – up
from the current 50% to 100%.
•  The goal is to encourage investment in T&D even during times of rising interest rates. The proposal
aims to start from the second regulatory period of the revenue cap system (FY2028–2032).
•  Business compensation, which covers the funding costs of general T&D utilities, is calculated by
multiplying the “rate base” (equivalent to the value of business assets) by the business compensation
rate.
•  Currently for assets under construction, which are incomplete and not yet benefiting grid users, only
50% of CWIP is included in the rate base.
•  CONTEXT: Amid growing need for T&D investment due to expansion of renewable energy and building
new data centers, maintaining the current system may not adequately cover the interest burden during
construction, raising concerns about delays in large-scale grid development. Including 100% of assets
under construction in the rate base aims to address this issue.
•  Also proposed was a mechanism to allow cost recovery through wheeling charges at the start of grid
construction. This would reduce financing costs and mitigate the interest burden, lowering wheeling
charges and easing costs for consumers.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE launches new working group for updating electricity system design
(Government statement, June 13)
o  ANRE launched a new System Design Working Group under the Subcommittee on the

Development of Next-Generation Electricity and Gas Business Infrastructure.
o  The group will tackle issues that come to light thanks to the review of electric power system
reform.
o  The WG plans to report on the status of its discussions in autumn and finalize its report by
the end of 2025.
o  CONTEXT: The Subcommittee on the Development of Next-Generation Electricity and Gas
Business Infrastructure only launched at the end of May to discuss institutional, business,
market, and competitive aspects of the electricity and gas industries. It is the successor to the
Electricity and Gas Basic Policy Subcommittee.

JERA might equip Sodegaura Thermal Power Station with GTCC
(Company statement, June 18)
•  JERA began evaluating plans to modernize the Sodegaura Thermal Power Station in Chiba Pref,
which has been operating since the 1970s.
•  The new facility will begin operation in or after FY2032. The number of units would drop from four
to three, and total capacity to 2.6 GW from the original 3.6 GW.
•  CONTEXT: The company plans an upgrade with a gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) system that
would improve generation efficiency by about 20%. This system would combine gas and steam turbines,
recovering waste heat from natural gas. The changes would boost the efficiency rate to 64% from 43%.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
MoE comments on JERA’s plans for LNG-fired units at Chita Power Station
(Government statement, June 20)
o  JERA plans to replace part of the Chita Thermal Power Station with two LNG-fired units

(Units 7 and 8; 1.32 GW total capacity).
o  MoE stresses that the utility must align with Japan’s commitment to net-zero by 2050. This
includes meeting intermediate emissions reduction targets set for 2035 and 2040.
• TAKEAWAY: While METI has refocused squarely on energy security and affordability, the MoE is trying to
ensure that the government’s decarbonization commitments are not overlooked. In fact, both ministries continue
to stress that net-zero remains a part of Japan’s energy strategy, and as such new thermal capacity must answer
questions around how it will lower emissions over time. Abatement (through CCUS) or low-carbon fuels (such
as hydrogen) are among the main options discussed today.



Groove Energy defaulted, missing May deadline

NEWS:    HYDROGEN


TEPCO selected by Tokyo City to build green hydrogen production facility in FY2028

(Company statement, June 20)
•  TEPCO HD was selected by Tokyo's Bureau of Industrial and Labor Affair to build a green hydrogen
production facility. TEPCO will develop more than 1 MW of solar capacity at a landfill site outside
the central breakwater in Koto-ku, Tokyo.
•  The basic design will be carried out in FY2025, construction will begin in FY2027 and operation will
begin in FY2028. The site will include solar panels, electrolyzers, hydrogen storage tanks, trailers for
transportation, and fixed compression stations.
•  Output will be a modest 100 Nm3/ h.
• TAKEAWAY: This project can be safely described as pilot-sized. With the announced hydrogen production rate,
it would be producing less than 80,000 kg of hydrogen a year. In practical terms, assuming an average fuel-cell
(FC) vehicle consumption of around 1 kg per 100 km, and an annual driving distance of 15,000 km per vehicle,
this output would only serve about 525 FC vehicles. Since FC trucks require ten times that volume, the facility
would only serve about 50 trucks. Still, the idea of creating small, local hubs to serve local needs – for a fuel that
is hard to store and transport over large distances – makes sense at this stage of market development. It will be

firing rates and GHG reduction of over 90%, with post-treatment emissions of ammonia and N₂O
reduced to near zero.
•  Development began in 2020 with fundamental ignition tests using rapid compression expansion
machines (RCEM).



Miura develops specialized testing facility for ammonia-fueled marine boilers

(Nikkei, June 18)
•  Miura, a major boiler manufacturer, completed a test facility for ammonia-fueled marine boilers at
its Horie Plant in Matsuyama, capable of burning up to 500 kg of ammonia per hour.
•  Ammonia combustion presents safety and environmental challenges due to nitrogen oxides (NOx)
emissions. Miura’s facility incorporates systems to eliminate them.
•  Following small-scale combustion tests completed in February, Miura seeks to develop practical-size
marine boilers, aiming for full commercialization.
•  CONTEXT: Ammonia is gaining attention as a zero-carbon alternative to heavy fuel oil, the dominant
energy source in marine boilers; this in line with the International Maritime Organization’s target of
net-zero in international shipping by around 2050.

•  Mitsubishi Corp will expand its U.S. solar power capacity 2.6 times by 2028, investing around ¥550
billion through its U.S. affiliate Nexamp.
•  The firm plans to grow from its assets from the current 1.1 GW to 2.9 GW, including its first large-
scale project in the U.S. Southwest by 2027, combining solar with battery storage for stable power
supply to data centers and other users.
•  To reduce tariff exposure, Nexamp is shifting procurement from SE Asia to domestically produced
solar panels.
•  CONTEXT: As electricity demand surges in the U.S, especially from data centers, Japanese trading
houses are ramping up solar investments, drawn by lower development costs and ongoing tax credits.
Itochu is aiming for 10 GW by 2030, while SoftBank is expanding its U.S. portfolio beyond 4 GW. Solar
power, easier to localize than wind and more cost-effective than nuclear, is the preferred option.
• TAKEAWAY: While these projects align with trading houses’ ambitious goals, the expansion of solar power in the
U.S. faces challenges due to a wave of anti-solar regulations, as well as rising procurement and financing costs.

Advanced Float secures ¥100 mln to develop floating nuclear plants
(Nikkei, June 20)
•  Tokyo-based startup Advanced Float, founded in 2024 by former TEPCO executive Anegawa
Hisashi, has received a ¥100 million pre-seed investment from venture capital firm Mirai Creation
Investments to develop floating nuclear power plants.
•  The concept — discussed by Council on Competitiveness-Nippon since 2020 — offers a seismic-
resistant, offshore alternative to land-based reactors, with precedents in Russia and development
underway in the U.S., Canada, and others.

•  Advanced Float is working with Mitsui Ocean Development on structural design, with construction
costs expected to exceed ¥400 billion. The company aims to begin test operations in the 2030s,
continuing to raise funding.
• TAKEAWAY: Advanced Float is not the only floating nuclear power project where Japanese funding has been
channeled. UK-based startup Core Power raised about $80 million from more than a dozen Japanese firms in
2013, including Onomichi Dockyard and Imabari Shipyard. Core Power, which aims to mass-produce molten-
salt floating NPPs, last year also partnered with Mitsubishi Research Institute to assess Japan’s maritime nuclear
market. The sector is still very much in the early stages of development, but investment flows suggest that
interest among businesses and government entities is growing.

JERA’s CEO Kani Yukio discusses LNG purchases from the U.S.
(Japan NRG, June 18)
•  CONTEXT: JERA Chairman and CEO Kani Yukio discussed the company’s LNG procurement strategy
from the U.S., noting the urgent need for the company to diversify its largely Asia-Pacific-based LNG
procurement portfolio of contracts. The utility has only 10 days worth of gas inventory in Tokyo Bay,
making diversity of suppliers and contract types vital for energy security, said Kani.
•  By the early 2030, JERA plans to increase U.S. imports to 10 Mpta.
•  LNG from the U.S. offers price competitiveness and flexibility, in contrast to Australia or the Middle
East, which often have destination restrictions.
•  Talks with the U.S. Dept of Energy began under Biden, but Kani sees a more supportive
environment under Trump for LNG exports.
•  The Panama Canal is the fastest route to Japan but poses logistical risks as back-ups are possible.
JERA assessed the competitiveness of alternative routes.
•  En route, JERA may sell LNG to countries like India, SE Asia, or Europe in order to manage risk and
maximize profit.
•  CONTEXT: Electricity demand in Japan has surged over the past year, driven by data center

development. With oil-fired power plants phased out, LNG is vital for stable, low-carbon energy supply.
•  Kani sees declining LNG demand in the long-term, but the fuel will remain crucial for Japan’s energy
security.
• TAKEAWAY: As already covered (see analysis section of the April 14 and April 21 issues), JERA has been eyeing
U.S. imports for a while. The company purchases about 30 Mtpa, and aims for 36 Mtpa by around 2035. The
U.S. could eventually supply a third of JERA’s total LNG purchases. With no destination clauses, this LNG could
be traded across Asia.

Woodside signs unique seasonal LNG deal with JERA amid rising winter demand
(Japan NRG, Reuters, June 20)
•  Woodside Energy will supply Japan’s largest power generator, JERA, with about 200,000 Mtpa of
LNG, exclusively during December to February, starting FY2027; this is a 5-year agreement.
•  The seasonal arrangement, signed at the LNG Producer-Consumer Conference in Tokyo, co-hosted
by Japan’s industry ministry and the IEA, gives JERA flexibility to forego deliveries during unusually
warm winters.
•  METI director Hasegawa described the deal as unusual but beneficial, noting it could help stabilize
Japan’s energy procurement and encouraged similar seasonal supply agreements with other
producers.
•  Separately, Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill forecasts global LNG demand rising 50% by 2030, driven by
population growth and increased energy flexibility needs, especially amid tensions near critical

supply routes like the Strait of Hormuz.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is suffering from greater than ever variance in power demand between peaks and troughs on
a seasonal basis. The demand volumes are sometimes twice that of trough volumes and that ratio could get
more extreme by 2030, according to JERA forecasts. This has led the company to look at more seasonal and
flexible contracts.



JERA CEO says Alaska LNG project to be evaluated in terms of costs
(Japan NRG, June 18)
•  JERA is evaluating the Alaska LNG project, citing its logistical advantages – only a seven-day voyage
to Japan. But it waits for the due diligence outcome before committing to offtake volumes.
•  After a 15-month LNG market study, JERA sees the need to grow procurement contracts due to
uncertainty over the nuclear sector’s inability to meet its own mid and long-term national targets.
•  With new LNG capacity post-2030 largely limited to Qatar and the U.S., Kani said that now is
perhaps the "last round" to lock in cost-effective LNG contracts amid rising EPC costs.
•  JERA is also leveraging land adjacent to its power plants to host data centers, and offers LNG-based
cooling solutions integrated with planned offshore wind and cross-border CCS to pitch this as
having decarbonization credentials.
• TAKEAWAY: Alaska is on track to require gas imports this decade due to its own growing local demand and
depleting resources, which is one reason a new local gas/ LNG project could take off. Also, the federal govt
might offer guarantees or cover a significant part of the gas pipeline construction costs, the project’s biggest
investment portion. Optimists say the project could move towards FID quickly – even as early as this year, based
on a few offtake contracts and U.S. federal guarantees. But many potential Japanese buyers worry about not
only the large investment amounts and LNG cost-competitiveness, but also whether the project would be
completed – within the estimated time frame – after the next change of presidents in Washington.

Canada.
•  He flagged a strategic shift: Europe has “lost trust in Russia” as a supplier, but cautioned against
swapping one dependency for another, in the form of the U.S.

•  TotalEnergies is advancing its Mozambique LNG project, expecting to restart development this
summer; poised to add ~13 Mtpa – part of the 30% capacity growth planned for 2027–29.
•  The firm accelerated U.S. LNG export packages, including the Cameron and Rio Grande projects, but
noted rising costs via the Panama Canal and sees Canadian LNG offering a competitive advantage,
especially due to lower CO2 emissions of local liquefaction plants.

Shell CEO eyes Asia for LNG expansion, talks down big M&A push
(Japan NRG, June 19)
•  Shell CEO Wael Sawan forecasted global LNG demand growth of 60% by 2040, reaching 700 Mtpa,
driven also by shipping industry expansion – with over 2,000 dual-fuel (LNG-capable) ships
currently on order.
•  China’s natural gas demand is rising significantly, set to climb from single digits to 20% of its energy
mix, while Japan remains a critical market and strategic player.
•  Shell intends to "double down" on LNG investments, targeting Asia alongside deeper positions in the
U.S., but seeks a careful, long-term investment horizon of 10+ years.
•  While Shell has assets targeted for divestment, Sawan said the firm is cautious and prefers
repurchasing its own shares to major acquisitions, allocating around $1–2 billion of their annual
$20–22 billion capital spending toward selective M&A.
•  Shell is exploring advanced energy solutions, including solar-traded electrons, biofuels, and bio/e-
methane projects, especially in Japan where LNG-to-e-methane conversations are progressing.

ANALYSIS

BY FILIPPO PEDRETTI

Against the Clock: Is Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP Ready to Restart?
Electricity prices in the Tokyo region remain stubbornly high, and the reason is not just
a weak yen. TEPCO, the main power supply to the most populous and industrial region
in Japan, continues to operate without a single nuclear reactor – all while national plans
call for nuclear’s share to be at 20% of the mix within five years.

The situation is unlikely to change for the next six months, and may not shift for a year
or more. Japan’s nuclear revival is still hostage to politics and public opinion, and
nowhere is this more apparent than in the Niigata Prefecture, which hosts the reactors
that supply Tokyo. Governor Hanazumi’s ability to draw out his decision on the restart
of TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP is nothing if not impressive.
This absence carries a hefty price tag. Without the NPP, TEPCO must rely more heavily
on LNG and coal-fired power. In FY2024, the firm’s profits plunged 40% and free cash
flow remained deeply negative for a seventh year. A restart of even one reactor could
swing the balance: by TEPCO’s own estimates – one unit would add ¥100 billion in
annual profit and ease pressure on spot electricity prices.

Hope flickered in April when Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s Unit 6 won support under OCCTO’s
LTDA, a subsidy scheme for zero-emission capacity. For the first time, the auction
opened up to reactor safety upgrade work at existing sites; three reactors were selected:
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 6; Tokai No. 2 (JAPC); and Tomari Unit 3 (Hokkaido Electric).
From FY2027, the winners will receive 20 years of guaranteed revenue.
For TEPCO, which also owns a 28.2% stake in JAPC, the auction offers a lifeline. But
local political resistance, reputational scars from Fukushima, and unfinished anti-
terrorism upgrades stand in the way, exposing the fragility of Japan’s nuclear policy. For
now, Tokyo’s nuclear revival remains more promising than power.

TEPCO’s finances and national policy
In FY2024, TEPCO saw profit drop 40% to ¥161.2 billion, capping seven straight years
of negative free cash flow. In addition, the utility had to pay out ¥557 billion in
Fukushima-related compensation.

The restart of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP is vital on several levels; both on a corporate
level for TEPCO and for overall national energy policy. The government is eager to see
the NPP restart in order to help raise the share of nuclear power from roughly 10%
today to about 20% by 2030. With an 8.2 GW capacity, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa accounts for
about 40% of the nearly 20 GW in nuclear power still offline.
Repeated delays have increased Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s maintenance and staffing costs,
driving up TEPCO’s fossil fuel expenses for replacement power sources. Further delays in
restarting either unit 6 or 7 will negatively affect TEPCO's financial recovery.

Tokyo area vs Kansai area electricity spot prices






















Source: JEPX
Under the gun, the utility will be happy to restart even one reactor in FY2025, which is
in contrast to earlier plans for two units online by FY2024. In this context, the inclusion
of Unit 6 in OCCTO’s results came as welcome news for TEPCO.

Unit 7
At the end of May, TEPCO said it was still betting on Unit 7’s restart over Unit 6. But
Unit 7, which is already loaded with nuclear fuel, won’t be able to operate after October
13 2025. The main problem is the need to complete construction work on an anti-
terrorism facility mandated by the NRA, and that work is expected to take 3–4 years.

The Niigata Prefecture will hold public hearings through August 31, and Governor
Hanazumi Hideyo won’t make a decision on the restart before September. Still,
regulatory inspections and test runs at Unit 7 would push full operation beyond the Oct
13 deadline.
Potential restart would most likely be impractical or short-lived. The NPP’s director said
that Unit 7 would take about two months from restart approval to reach actual
operation.

This delay has induced TEPCO to switch gears and prioritize the restart of the other
eligible reactor, Unit 6, which was selected under the LTDA. Nevertheless, it still needs
the same local approval and will be subject to inspection.

Unit 6
Unit 6’s main advantage is that it will shut for anti-terrorism facility construction work
only in September 2029. That’s a lot of breathing room. By that time, the work on Unit
7’s will have been completed and it can be put into operation.

So, TEPCO confidently began loading nuclear fuel on June 10. On that same day,
TEPCO received NRA approval to conduct tests of safety systems. With safety equipment
installation completed, TEPCO doesn’t expect any more major delays.















Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant. Source: TEPCO

This move produced immediate results, fueling hopes among TEPCO’s investors. Share
price on the Prime Market rose sharply on June 10, at one point gaining +4.22%.

Sentiment toward Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s restart is less polarized than a simple "yes or
no" poll-framing might suggest. While the business community sees restart as a
profitable endeavor, TEPCO’s persistent reputational fallout from Fukushima still stokes
opposition.
Unlike other EPCOs, many people are wary of letting TEPCO manage critical
infrastructure in light of its recent weak record on safety and transparency. TEPCO could
probably find itself bound by strict conditions that other NPP operators don’t face. But
hammering out those hypothetical conditions, and determining how to monitor them,
will take much time.

Finally, local politics is an important factor that’s often overlooked by analysts and
investors. Governor Hanazumi’s current term is nearing its end, and there are signs he
may let these issues linger unresolved until his term is over, thus escaping responsibility
for any unpopular decision. All of this guarantees that the restart will be pushed further
into the future.

Conclusion
While Japan’s strategy to reinvigorate nuclear power took off in late 2022 in the wake of
that year’s energy crisis, those efforts are now coming up against the hard realities on
the ground, which include local community approval and state regulations.
Nationwide, 14 of 17 NRA-approved reactors have restarted since 2015. KEPCO
accounts for seven operational reactors, while TEPCO has none. Political friction,
coupled with a widespread distrust in TEPCO, keeps key plants idle. The OCCTO
auctions, by underwriting nuclear upgrades, send a signal of commitment and support
to the industry, but so far its impact has been limited.

The EPCOs are stuck between rising costs and political bottlenecks. This outcome
dictates profitability: utilities with restarted reactors (KEPCO, Kyushu Electric) thrive
financially. Meanwhile, those that don’t secure a restart (TEPCO, Hokkaido Electric) find
themselves in financial hot water.
Japan’s nuclear revival is struggling. While there are promises and subsidies, the fact is
that these efforts have proceeded much slower than expected. The inability to build a
strong consensus among all stakeholders is Japan’s greatest challenge to repowering its
NPPs.

Finding a way to bridge the divide – which is mostly an issue of public perception – is
perhaps more important than any technological or bureaucratic hurdle. To date,
ministries in Tokyo seem unable or unwilling to confront this challenge.

Green Steel Goes Global: Japan, EU and Sweden on
Different Paths to Same Goal

Long one of the world’s most energy and emissions-intensive industries, the steel sector
is slowly starting to embrace ways to become ‘green’.

Governments and businesses from Tokyo and Luleå (Sweden) to Brussels are vying to
demonstrate that ‘green steel’ is not just feasible but also scalable. The objective is to
make steel with as little negative impact (i.e. emissions) on the environment as possible.
Three of the flagship projects pioneering this new direction are HYBRIT in Sweden;
Green Steel for Europe (EU); and COURSE50 (Japan). Each is influenced by their
respective industrial tradition, regulatory incentives, and regional limitations.

While still in pilot phases, they collectively chart a path toward decarbonizing a sector
responsible for roughly 7% of global CO2 emissions. All three approaches also share the
common element of hydrogen as a central solution. But as they move from pilot to
industrial scale, there are complexities to navigate. Can the national and regional steel
sectors follow?

Fostering international cooperation and uniform standards for green steel, as well as
creating distinct markets for such products – which Japan categorizes as GX (green
transformation) goods – will be crucial in order to economic success.

Developments in Japan
Japan’s steel industry, long reliant on coal-fired blast furnaces (BFs) and basic oxygen
furnaces (BOFs), faces growing pressure to cut carbon emissions. With few domestic
energy resources, it has struggled to pivot away from coal – a fuel that’s relatively easy
to source and store. But in the mid-2000s, the country’s major producers – Nippon Steel,
JFE, and Kobe Steel – launched a new program to reduce emissions from existing BFs as
a transitional step.
In partnership with the government and academia, in 2008 the firms created COURSE50
(short for “CO2 Ultimate Reduction System for Cool Earth 50”) as an R&D project that
set a goal to cut emissions 30% by injecting hydrogen-rich gases into blast furnaces and
capturing the CO2.
Through the 2010s, Japanese steelmakers built a 12 m³ test blast furnace at Kimitsu
Steel Works in Chiba Prefecture and gradually improved the hydrogen injection and

carbon capture methods. By 2022, COURSE50’s initial phase concluded, having
demonstrated an over 10% CO2 reduction via hydrogen (using coke oven gas), plus
~20% via CO2 capture.












This was followed by an upgraded “Super COURSE50” program (2022 onward)
targeting a 50% emission reduction by using externally sourced hydrogen and advanced
heat management in blast furnaces.

After a slow start, the project has seen its progress accelerate in the 2020s. Nippon Steel
reported a 22% CO2 reduction in 2022 tests; 33% in 2023; and 43% in late 2024 – a
world record for blast furnaces.

Developments in Europe
Rather than building a specific steel plant, the Green Steel for Europe (GREENSTEEL)
project convened stakeholders to chart decarbonization pathways for the EU's entire
steel sector. Its comprehensive roadmap explores multiple technologies (from hydrogen
direct reduction to carbon capture and even electrolysis), and has outlined mid- and
long-term trajectories to achieve the EU’s 2030 and 2050 climate goals.
GREENSTEEL also assessed investment needs and policy impact, concluding that
transitioning EU steel would require massive funding and policy support. The initiative
wrapped up by 2021 with recommendations that continue to shape EU industrial and
climate policy.

In Sweden, HYBRIT made history by moving quickly from concept to pilot, as part of the
country’s ambitious commitment to achieve a net-zero carbon economy by 2045.
Construction of a pilot direct reduction plant in Luleå began in 2018, and by July 2021,
HYBRIT produced the world’s first batch of steel made with 100% green hydrogen
instead of coal, delivered to Volvo.

In 2022, HYBRIT also opened an innovative underground hydrogen storage cavern to
buffer supply. By late 2024, Sweden was poised to produce the world’s first truly zero-
carbon steel at an industrial scale, a major milestone in steel history.

Sourcing hydrogen
The amount of hydrogen required to replace coal as a reducing agent in the steelmaking
process is one factor that distinguishes the different decarbonization methods.
Hydrogen is the primary enabler of a completely fossil-free process in HYBRIT, which
reduces emissions over 95% by substituting hydrogen-based direct reduction for the
blast furnace. According to its own data, 50–60 kg of hydrogen is needed to make one
ton of green steel using this method. Only water vapor is released when the hydrogen,
which is created by electrolysis with renewable electricity, combines with iron ore to
form sponge iron.

In comparison, Japan's COURSE50 has a more gradual ecological benefit strategy: it
aims to refit blast furnaces with carbon capture and hydrogen injection devices rather
than getting rid of them altogether. While the more recent "Super COURSE50" attempts
to inject externally produced hydrogen, the earlier model used hydrogen-rich gas from
coke furnaces.
The amount of hydrogen required per ton of steel is less, usually 10–30 kilograms,
depending on the extent of CO2 capture. (Hydrogen can’t completely replace coke in a
standard blast furnace.)

With GREENSTEEL, hydrogen-based direct reduction combined with electric arc
furnaces became a top candidate. Similar to HYBRIT, this approach utilizes about 50–60
kg of hydrogen per ton, making it a viable option, especially for nations with a lot of
green electricity.

The takeaway is clear: all three programs are centered on hydrogen as the foundation of
green steel, and illustrate different backgrounds: Japan’s focus on retrofitting current
processes; the EU’s broad policy-driven coordination; and Sweden’s push for
revolutionary process change.
The steel industry’s carbon-neutral roadmap calls for using hydrogen and extensive
carbon capture, but achieving this will require sustained state incentives and new
policies to deploy infrastructure (e.g. hydrogen supply networks and CO2 storage
sites).

Policy comparisons
Policy frameworks in each region have significantly shaped the initiatives. Japan’s
approach relies on government-industry collaboration without heavy carbon pricing.
Japan supported COURSE50 through state agencies like NEDO and METI, and with
support from the Green Innovation Fund for breakthrough projects. However, Japan
lacks a rigorous carbon tax/ ETS for industry; instead, it uses voluntary benchmarks and
industrial roadmaps.
The goal of Super COURSE50 is to upgrade current blast furnaces with CO2 capture and
hydrogen injection. After the test results at the Kimitsu plant showed a 43% drop in CO2
in 2024, the aim is to pursue full-scale trials in 2026.


















Should that be successful, the goal is to deploy a hybrid decarbonization model
nationwide that would see a third of Japan’s steel production coming from Super
COURSE50 blast furnaces, a third from hydrogen DRI, and a third from increased
electric arc furnace recycling.

Meanwhile, the EU has implemented an integrated policy mix that combines “sticks” and
“carrots”. The stick is the EU’s ETS carbon price and the incoming carbon border tariff
(CBAM), which put financial pressure on steelmakers to cut emissions or pay hefty
penalties.
The carrots include large-scale funding programs: the EU’s Innovation Fund has already
allocated over €2 billion to support hydrogen-based steel projects. One major example is
the €143 million grant awarded to HYBRIT’s demo plant in 2022. Additionally, the EU
launched a public-private Clean Steel Partnership to invest in R&D up to 2030, and is

aligning standards and procurement policies (e.g. green public purchasing) to create
demand for low-carbon steel.

For its part, Sweden complements EU policy with national measures. Through the
Swedish Energy Agency, the government co-financed HYBRIT’s pilot phases and set an
ambitious national net-zero 2045 target.
In summary, EU and Swedish policies actively shape a market for green steel, whereas
Japan’s support is more focused on R&D subsidies and future infrastructure planning.

Conclusion
Depending on the process, producing green steel can still cost anywhere from 35 to
100% more per ton than conventional steel. Additional commercial validation comes
from early offtake agreements with industrial buyers and automakers like Volvo.

Nevertheless, with sufficient state support, millions of tons of low-CO2 steel are
expected to enter the market across several countries by the late 2020s. Achieving this
goal hinges on scaling hydrogen supply and carbon capture and storage (CCS)
infrastructure. For Japan, this transitional model might also be exportable to steel-heavy
economies such as China and India, or at least to overseas mills operated by Japanese
companies.
Decarbonizing steel is crucial for achieving broader climate goals. The more than 30 EU-
based low-carbon steel projects, COURSE50’s industrial trials at Nippon Steel's Kimitsu
works, and HYBRIT’s 1.3 million-ton demonstration plant all clearly indicate that the
shift from concept to reality is now fully underway.
