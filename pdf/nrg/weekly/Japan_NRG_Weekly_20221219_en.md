Govt to expand JCM for the private sector

(Japan NRG, Dec. 13)
•  By March 2023, MoE and METI will issue guidelines to encourage private sector activity in the Joint
Crediting Mechanism framework, a govt official told Japan NRG.
•  This will explain the process that enables projects fully funded by the private sector to be
recognized under the JCM framework and to be awarded carbon offset credits.
•  JCM projects include private sector projects that receive state development aid.
•  CONTEXT: There are 25 countries participating in the JCM, generating over 210 projects. Japan is
committed to expand JCM to 30 countries and to generate 100 million CO2 equivalent tons of

JCM-derived credits by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: Opening the JCM system to projects wholly financed by the private sector will expand its scope
significantly, helping the country reach its 2030 credit goal. Presently, international companies can’t take active
roles in government-funded JCM projects and the guidance should be of great interest to many multinational
businesses.


METI: Emissions trading to launch in 2026, “GX surcharge” in 2028, allowance in 2033

(Japan NRG, Dec. 14)
•  Starting in 2028, METI wants to introduce a carbon pricing plan that will see charges imposed on
oil companies, trading companies, and other importers of fossil fuels. This carbon surcharge will be
called a “GX surcharge”.
•  The govt will release details about the plan at a GX meeting later this month.
•  Also, Japan’s biggest emitters will be encouraged to participate in an emissions trading plan to

begin in 2026; but electricity companies that use fossil fuels may not be charged for their emissions
until around 2033.
•  A GX League carbon trading platform, launched in Sept as a pilot, will move to “phase 2 of
voluntary trading” in 2023 and will remain voluntary until the next phase in 2026.
•  In phase 2, participants are expected to generate a large volume of voluntary credits.
•  To spur growth, the govt plans to spend ¥20 trillion in the next 10 years on non-fossil energy
development, structural changes in industry, and resource recycling. The state money will trigger

private sector investments that are expected to reach ¥150 trillion.
•  CONTEXT: The GX Council, which reports to the PM, is also making GX policy proposals.
• TAKEAWAY: As is now usual, at the end of the year METI launches a flurry of major announcements that could
play a big impact on future developments. This latest 100-page document is a blockbuster of data and policy.
There are details on GX fundraising and spending that may become more important in 2023. Japan NRG will
continue to review the changes and offer commentary as the situation develops.

METI plans to build 8 key hydrogen/ammonia supply bases
(Japan NRG, Dec. 12)
•  METI plans to build three large and five medium-sized hydrogen/ammonia supply facilities
nationwide over a 10-year period.

•  The three large bases will serve major cities and five more will be built across Japan.
•  The Green Innovation Fund will finance feasibility studies, front-end engineering designs and
building of tanks, pipelines and other infrastructure.
•  CONTEXT: METI’s scenario, which is described in the interim report of ammonia/hydrogen fuel
policy panels, is to start ammonia/hydrogen power generation by 2030 while cutting supply costs
to fuel their applications. The state will provide financing and regulatory support to accelerate

building the supply chain.
• TAKEAWAY: METI seeks speedy infrastructure solutions, but technologies from well-to-gate are still
developing. One panel member said there may be other technologies, such as synthetic fuels, with superior
properties to ammonia/hydrogen; all possible options need to compete.

The other issue that may slow down the development of these bases is the need for local buy-in. Technically,
local governments are supposed to lead the formulation of the base plans, though it will undoubtedly be
industry players that help to draft them.


LDP members want the replacement of nuclear reactors in the year-end GX statement

(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 14)
•  The LDP’s Federation for Promoting Replacement of Nuclear Reactors met with MoE Minister
Nishimura to request a safety review for reactor replacements.
•  The MPs want the conclusion of the GX Council at the end of this month to be approved in a
Cabinet meeting. That would essentially see the 6th Basic Energy Plan amended and augur in the
7th Basic Energy Plan.
•  The MPs want permit extension for aged nuclear reactors to be coupled with approvals for

replacement units. This would not necessarily mean that an old unit is replaced with a new one at
the same site. The operator would be free to build a new unit at a different site that it owns.
• TAKEAWAY: Lawmakers and the industry are keen to make sure that the decommissioning of aged reactors
does not deplete the overall nuclear capacity. Also, it may be easier logistically to have new construction
ongoing at one site while there are decommissioning works at another.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Public supports extension of nuclear reactor operating life: Poll
(NHK, Dec. 13)
o  A poll by public broadcaster NHK showed that 45% of the public support, and only 37%
oppose, plans to extend the operating period of NPPs while also developing and
building next-gen reactor technology. Another 18% of respondents were undecided.
o  Opposition is clustered among the elderly, women, and supporters of opposition parties.

Nuclear regulator asks for additional approval rights outside of operating license terms
(Asahi Shimbun, Dec. 15)
•  The current nuclear operating life permit system gives out a 40-year permit for a new reactor,
which can be augmented by a further 20 years upon review. However, the industry regulator, NRA,

wants an additional approval system to be put into place under which reactors are reviewed every
10 years starting from 30 years in operation.
•  Under the new system, a "long-term facility management plan" that outlines both the operator’s
policies and the results of equipment inspections must be submitted.
•  The NRA wants to start the new system soon.
• TAKEAWAY: Operating nuclear facilities within all the rules and regulations is already a highly bureaucratic and

labor-intensive task. Utilities must submit some 10,000 pages of documents to the NRA for restart approvals of
each reactor unit. Introducing a new system will add to the workload on both the utility and regulator side.
And while the regulator is willing to let the operators submit their documents ahead of time to allow for an
adequate period, the possibility that a facility is taken offline because of inadequate paperwork or additional
questions from the NRA is not small.

• The introduction of a new system will likely make the nuclear industry seem safer in the eyes of the public,
which is important at a time when operators and the government seek approval to move forward with
construction of new nuclear facilities. However, there are 17 reactors in Japan that have already passed the 30-
year mark. If they are all subjected to additional reviews, something is sure to slow down. That will be either
the restart of existing units, the review of older units for life extensions, or the formulation of rules for next-
generation technologies. The size of the NRA's staff seems too small to cope with all the above at the same

time.


METI is to build database to promote recycling of solar panels

(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 16)
•  ANRE will build a database of solar panel products to accelerate the recycling of discarded units.
•  Recycling of used panels is regulated by waste management law, but not enough product data has
been provided so far to facilitate waste disposal services. In some cases, the recycling method isn’t
clear due to a lack of information about source materials.
•  ANRE plans to build a database by manufacturer and model numbers that will clarify both the

components of the unit and the recycling treatment methods. This information will be given to
waste disposal companies.
• TAKEAWAY: METI expects that the disposal of solar panels could peak in the second half of 2030s. Therefore,
METI is now preparing for that period of mass disposal.



Japan to host first ministerial meeting of the Asia Zero Emissions Community
(Asia Nikkei, Dec. 15)
•  On March 4, 2023, Japan is due to host the first meeting of energy ministers from Australia and the
Southeast Asian nations. METI minister Nishimura will attend the Tokyo meeting, which is intended
to build on the government’s Asia Zero Emission Community concept.

•  CONTEXT: Japan and the U.S. are leading a $20 billion agreement with Indonesia to cut its
reliance on coal-fired power. This model could be used for other Asian countries.

Japan will share risk with financial institutions to invest in new green technologies
(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 14)
•  METI, the Financial Services Agency and MoE said they’ll share the risk with private financial
companies to develop technologies for decarbonizing.

•  The govt will promote “blended finance” to mobilize private sector finance towards sustainable
development.
• TAKEAWAY: Blended finance for green energy technology is supposed to function like the current role
performed by NEDO and NEF (New Energy Foundation). But as those state organizations are under a ministry
(such as METI or MoE), a new cross-sectoral financial mechanism needs to be established to develop
innovative green technologies.



Toyo Engineering to convert fertilizer ammonia to green fuel in Indonesia

(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 13)
•  In Indonesia, Toyo Engineering will convert ammonia made for fertilizer use into green fuel. The
ammonia will be supplied by Pupuk Indonesia Holding Co. (PIHC).
•  While PIHC’s annual ammonia production capacity is 7.3 million tons, about 1.2 million tons is
surplus due to a decrease in natural gas production. Toyo Engineering will convert this surplus into
fuel for co-combustion at coal-fired power plants or for shipping. The conversion will use energy
from renewable sources.
•  Toyo Engineering has designed 86 ammonia plants worldwide, which amounts to more than a 10%

share of all ammonia plants globally.
• TAKEAWAY: In May 2022, METI tapped Toyo Engineering to do a feasibility study for green ammonia
production in collaboration with PIHC. Thus, this collaboration seems to have been planned thanks to METI
oversight.

IHI starts feasibility study to produce ammonia in Malaysia

(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 16)
•  IHI concluded a MoU with Gentari Hydrogen, a subsidiary of Petronas’ clean energy entity, to
evaluate the feasibility of the production and sale of green ammonia made from electricity
generated by solar power.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The plan is to build a plant with 200,000 tons/ year production capacity, starting in 2026. The
green ammonia might be used for power generation and shipping fuel.
•  The green ammonia would be used in Malaysia, and also exported to Japan and other Asian
countries.



MHI to study ammonia co-firing at coal power plant in Chile
(Company statement, Dec. 7)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries signed an MoU with Chile’s Guacolda Energía to conduct a feasibility
study for ammonia co-firing at a 758 MW coal-fired power plant in Huasco, Atacama Region,
approximately 700 km north of the capital city of Santiago.
•  MHI had previously supplied the boiler, steam turbine, and other core facilities for this plant.

•  A two-phase study through 2026 will give a detailed plan for demonstration of 30% co-firing.



Toyota and Thailand’s CP Group to produce hydrogen from farm waste
(Company Statement, Dec. 14)
•  Toyota Motor will collaborate with Charoen Pokphand Group, Thailand's biggest business group

by revenue, on a project to turn farm waste into hydrogen fuel.
•  The Japanese company is keen to show other options for clean transport outside of EVs.
•  The two companies will make hydrogen using biogas. This will then go into fuel cells for new
delivery trucks that CP will deploy in its operations.
•  Toyota and CP will also study ways to improve the efficiency of logistics through connectivity
technology.



Euglena mulls $1 billion biofuel refinery in Malaysia for SAF
(Nikkei Asia, Dec. 15)
•  Japanese biotech startup Euglena is studying whether to build a biofuel refinery in Malaysia with
local state-run oil company Petronas and Italian energy multinational Eni.
•  The refinery would produce sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel fuel using waste oil, a type of
algae known as euglena, and other forms of biomass.
•  The investment decision is expected in 2023, with the refinery's completion planned for 2025;

Euglena would acquire 30% of the $1 billion, 730,000 kiloliter/ year project.


Mitsui mulls $550 million bioplastics factory in the U.S.
(Asia Nikkei, Dec. 14)
•  Trading house Mitsui is considering building one of the world’s largest bioplastics factories in the

southeastern U.S, with investment estimated at $550 million.
•  Mitsui has an MoU with U.S. chemicals firm Petron Scientech to explore a JV.
•  CONTEXT: Bioplastic is plant-based as opposed to traditional plastic, which is made using crude
oil. The proposed bio-PET plastics factory would have an annual capacity of 400,000 tons and
could start in 2025. This would significantly boost global bio-PET capacity and complement current
recycling efforts by beverage makers.

Tokyo solar bylaw prompts vigorous debate
(Tokyo Shimbun, Dec. 12)
•  Liberal Democratic Party members in the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly criticized a proposed bylaw
mandating solar panel installment on roofs of new residential buildings.

•  They say that the panels will only bring Tokyo 0.4% closer to its pledged emissions target, and the
government has a responsibility to make residents aware of this.
•  The regional political party Tomin First countered by saying that in addition to environmental
benefits, the panels bring financial benefits; the average household using a 4-kW system could
save about ¥1.5 million over 30 years.

Transmission companies now allowed to select power sources, aiding renewables
(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 15)
•  Starting Dec 21, transmission companies will change the system to select which electricity can be
allowed on the power grid. Under the new rule, more renewable energy should be allowed to
enter the grid.
•  CONTEXT: This could also lead to lower electricity prices assuming that the renewables sources

are providing cheaper power than thermal stations.
•  Under the current rule, some renewables operators are only able to secure a “non-firm” grid
connection. This means that when the power system is adequately supplied, these generators are
asked to curtail output.
•  Under the new rule, grid operators can select electricity using a “merit order” system, which ranks
output based on cost and, in some cases, emissions levels.

• TAKEAWAY: The new approach is described as the Japanese version of the “Connect and Manage” system,
which allowed more generation capacity to connect to the grid before the transmission network was upgraded.
Under this new system, the discretion of grid operators would increase.

Non-firm Grid Connection Mechanism













Kawasaki Heavy mulls hydrogen-fired power plant in Japan by FY2030

Japanese wind developers concerned about shortage of offshore wind turbines from EU
(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 16)
•  Japanese wind developers are concerned that EU offshore wind suppliers will miss delivery
deadlines due to the spate of new large-sized offshore wind plants in the EU. For example, the

world’s largest offshore wind farm is Hornsea 2 (1.39 GW), which started operation in September in
the North Sea.
•  In Japan, planned wind farm output in Chiba and Akita are 391 MW and 479 MW, much less
ambitious and lucrative than the EU market. Thus, Japan worries that EU suppliers such as Siemens
Gamesa or Vestas won’t deliver the promised equipment on schedule.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI officially licenses Mitsubishi consortium's three offshore wind farms
(Government statement, Dec. 13)
o  METI licensed the Mitsubishi consortium operating offshore wind farms in Akita and

o  The output of each wind turbine increased from 12.6 MW to 13 MW.
o  Construction will start in 2025-2026, and the turbines to be operational in 2028-2030.
• TAKEAWAY: According to the consortium’s regulatory filing, the wind turbines will be built more than 10
meters below sea level to protect marine resources in shallow waters. Furthermore, the group will be discrete

in selecting the sites for the installation to preserve biodiversity in the area.

(Company statement, Dec. 12)
o  Japan Renewable Energy will switch its Omachi Solar Power Plant in Nagano Prefecture

from the FIT system to FIP after concluding a power purchase agreement (PPA) with JRE
Trading, a wholly-owned subsidiary.
o  JRE will buy all power from the plant, which began operation in April 2022, and assume
the additional risks associated with the FIP system, such as generation imbalance (i.e. the
difference between planned and actual power generation volumes).



Toshiba runs its own geothermal power plant for the first time: Seeks increase demand

(Nikkei Business; Dec. 13)
•  Nakao Geothermal Power Plant, a JV between Toshiba and Chubu Electric, began operating a 2
MW facility after 10 years of troubled development that ran up a ¥4.5 billion budget. The JV seeks
to marry geothermal power with hot-spring tourism, which has always been a difficult matter in
Japan.
•  Since 1966, Toshiba has delivered geothermal equipment, but this is its first geothermal plant

operation. Toshiba has a 55% stake in the JV which has an FIT contract.
•  Although Japan forecasts that geothermal energy will account for a mere 1% of the country’s
electricity mix in FY2030, geothermal is a valuable domestic power source considering current

KEPCO wants to keep rates low for domestic subscribers: CEO
(Jiji, Dec. 15)
o  CEO Mori is opposed to asking the govt for permission to raise rates; he wants to avoid
making households pay more for electricity.

o  This is in contrast to KEPCO’s competitors, which seek to raise rates by up to 45%.
o  Commenting on plans to relax the moratorium on new nuclear power plants, Mori said
new NPPs require significant investment, and it’s very important that they be profitable.
Mori seeks state financial support for such projects.

(Toyo Keizai, Dec. 17)
•  The Japan Fair Trade Commission notified Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric and Kyushu Electric
that it intends to fine them a total of over ¥100 billion for restraining free trade on the electricity
market.
•  Kyushu Electric says it was informed that the JFTC found evidence of collusion with other utilities
to hold rates stable, and that a fine of ¥2.7 billion was deemed appropriate.
•  The scandal came at a bad time for Chugoku Electric, which days before requested METI to

approve a rate increase of 31% for customers on legacy (pre-deregulation) plans.

•  A spokesperson for Chugoku claimed that the rate increase was unrelated to antitrust fines, and
that fines would not be passed on to subscribers.
•  Kansai Electric was granted leniency and is exempt from fines, but its role in the cartel raises
questions over statements by former CEO Morimoto Takashi that his resignation in April was
unrelated to a JFTC raid last year.

•  Morimoto’s replacement, Mori Nozomu, is also likely to be tainted by the scandal.
• TAKEAWAY: As of Dec 15, the JFTC has not issued formal decisions on the alleged cartel case, following its
Dec 1 letter to the companies informing them they were under cartel charges. The actual amount of the
penalties and details of leniency applications have not been disclosed yet.

Road to Japan’s Battery Future:
METI Sets Goals for Developing the Burgeoning Industry

When officials drafted Japan’s new national energy strategy last year, the
development of storage batteries was seen as a longer-term process, more a 2050
than a 2030 issue. That view, however, was strongly upgraded this year, with more
urgency and KPIs put on the sector.

METI’s Battery Industry Strategy is nothing if not a grand vision. With a focus on
lithium-ion chemistry and all-solid-state technologies, the Strategy sees Japanese
firms manufacturing more battery capacity by 2030 than is being installed globally
today.

The Strategy details not only the capacity. It also estimates the investments required
to set up the component and unit manufacturing, the money needed for the
procurement of raw materials, and the scale of human resources that should be
involved. The 30,000 people that METI says will be needed to operate the enlarged
battery supply chain is only about 40% fewer than Japan’s entire nuclear power
industry.

The challenges to delivering such a vision are equally grand. Among them, ironically,
is the need to deliver on reducing the domestic price of electricity.


Strategy by numbers
With the spread of renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs), Japan needs to
secure a bigger storage battery manufacturing base. METI’s Storage Battery Industry
Strategy promises that the government will take the lead in ensuring this happens
rather than leaving investment in facilities and the upstream (raw materials) to the
private sector.

The Strategy sets out several goals:
●  Establish a domestic manufacturing base for 150 GWh of storage batteries and
materials by 2030 at the latest
●  Ensure that Japanese companies produce 600 GWh of batteries globally by the
end of this decade, giving them a 20% market share
●  Increase domestic production capacity of automotive batteries to 100 GWh as
soon as possible
●  Accelerate R&D so that Japan recovers its global share in the market for next-
gen of batteries and has full-scale output of all-solid-state Li-on batteries by around
2030
●  Attract about 30,000 workers throughout the storage battery supply chain by
2030
●  Promote the reuse and recycling of batteries and their materials
●  Expand the use of renewable energy
●  Reduce the cost of electricity

For comparison, the cumulative capacity of stationary Li-ion battery storage systems
shipped in Japan was around 2.6 GWh in FY2019, rising to 3.5 GWh in FY2020, and
about 4.4 GWh in FY2021.


Show me the money
Dreaming big is important, but METI understands that one reason Japanese battery
makers lost market share to Chinese and South Korean rivals was due to scale.
Chinese firms, in particular, quickly added capacity in the dominant liquid Li-on tech
thanks to strong state support.

This time, the government is keen to share the investment burden, which it expects to
be around ¥3.4 trillion, to expand the manufacturing base to 150 GWh. That number
assumes the need for ¥1.3 trillion to build up the raw materials and components
supply chain and ¥2.1 trillion for the manufacturing base.

Industry has not been shy to ask for greater state involvement. The Battery Supply
Chain Council (BASC), a new industry group set up in April 2021, is asking the
government to subsidize two-thirds of key investments. The group, which counts
battery manufacturers, suppliers, and automakers among its more than 100 members,
says that such a contribution is a must if Japan is to get to the same starting line as its
top competitors.

Nowhere is state support more urgent than upstream. BASC says that the U.S.
government contributed the bigger portion of investments that domestic firms made
to secure lithium resources in South America and Australia. In Japan, public money
accounts for just 10% of total funds.

To attempt a global production capacity of 600 GWh of batteries, Japanese firms
would need to secure vast quantities of critical raw materials. The investment in nickel
alone would be about ¥1.3 trillion (150,000 tons); for lithium – ¥680 billion (320,000
tons).

To get Japan to the same “starting line” as other nations, BASC says the state must
invest ¥1.3 trillion over five years. The estimate for adding 450 GWh of capacity
overseas is about ¥10.2 trillion.


Challenges
The government set target prices of ¥70,000/ kWh for residential energy storage
systems and ¥60,000/ kWh for commercial/industrial energy storage systems by
FY2030 as levels at which capital investments can be recovered through the revenue
that these systems generate.

However, arguably the biggest challenge is creating a good environment for the
battery industry to thrive. The sector is energy intensive and needs both low electricity
prices and a thriving market for renewable energy in order to be sustainable. This
makes the expansion of renewables in Japan a key factor in improving the industrial
competitiveness of the domestic battery players.

Equally, the carbon footprint of battery manufacture will become an important
competitive factor in the global market. For now, Japan’s power mix is still tilted
towards fossil fuels.

Battery makers will need access to cheap land and green electricity that’s not only
competitive on a domestic level but which can go head-to-head with industry peers
abroad. While the cost of solar PV generation has dropped in the last decade, Japan’s
levels remain close to double those in Europe.

Solutions to the above can be found in one of the 12 case studies selected by the
government as part of a project to “support the introduction of grid storage batteries,
as part of the accelerated rollout of renewable energy.” The companies behind the
projects will test various business models for batteries, pooling revenues from the
capacity market (kW value), the wholesale / spot market (kWh value), and the
electricity balancing market (△kW value + kWh value).

The economics of battery manufacturing and storage battery use in Japan are still
evolving, but at least now there’s a sense of urgency. This is a watershed moment for
Japan to regain its global leadership in the sector.

ENERGY       JOBS   IN  JAPAN:    COLUMN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Establishing an Image of Stability and Commitment
To Attract Talent


Last week a report was published in the U.S. stating that 73% of new graduates
ranked job stability as their top priority when choosing an employer. Among the
leading factors for this are the current inflation and rising living costs, as well as the
widespread belief that a recession is on the horizon.

People are not merely looking at whatever job might be on offer right now. Rather,
they wish to see how their career will develop and grow internally over a 5-to-10-year
timeframe.

In Japan, this prioritization of stability is nothing new. The country’s belief system still
promotes the notion of lifetime employment. Also, social status is often linked to the
prestige of your company’s name, much more than your job title or income.

To illustrate the importance of social status, some time ago one of our clients shared
an interesting story. They were hiring a young, talented business developer from one
of Japan’s most prestigious employers - a top-tier trading house. The new company
offered the man a more senior position and a higher salary.

In the end, the young candidate accepted the offer. However, he did ask to delay the
start date because he was due to wed soon. At the time of the ceremony, his family
wanted to claim the boasting rights associated with employment at a top trading
house.

For multinational companies hiring in Japan, understanding these cultural nuances is
critical. In today’s volatile market, with a fast-changing energy landscape and global
economic uncertainty, demonstrating a stability within your firm, and your brand's
commitment to the Japan market is paramount. Let us dig into some specifics.


GK vs KK
A corporate entity in Japan can be set up as either a GK (Godo Gaisha) or KK
(Kabushiki Kaisha). Both are limited liability companies and a suitable option to
establish a local subsidiary. A GK is typically easier to set up with lower reporting
requirements, has a cheaper registration and less requirements for shareholder
meetings, reporting, and etc.

From a Japanese perspective though, a GK is seen as a lesser form of commitment.
Having a KK in Japan is a clear demonstration of taking one’s business seriously and
planning to be here for the long term.

Shared office vs own space
We can argue that Covid-19 has changed the landscape on this issue. However,
traditionally an office in a shared space such as Regus or WeWork was seen as a
temporary measure. Hence, an indication that a foreign business was only planning a

20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

temporary sojourn in Japan. Long-term office space, rental contracts and build outs
are expensive here. However, making such investments is also seen as a statement of
intent.


Attitude to local partnerships
Newer, less known names in the conservative energy industry can gain brand
recognition by association. Secure a partnership with a Mitsubishi or Itochu, not to
mention financing from a major Japanese bank, and your credibility will soar.

On the other hand, if you come to Japan demonstrating an attitude that your
technology, business plan, track record, etc. are superior to local options, or demand
that you sell your tech without a local partnership, you’ll be met with high levels of
doubt from potential employees. Building credibility will be an uphill battle.


Local hire vs expat leadership
This is the toughest! Japanese employees (and business partners) disdain those global
firms that enter the market with an expatriate leader whose only mandate is to copy
the blueprint of [insert country here] locally. Therefore, our firm often advocates
choosing a Japanese person to be the country manager.

This demonstrates not only a commitment to Japan, but it’s also a clear sign of trust
that the local talent pool can deliver, which in turn attracts more talent in the mid-
lower levels. You can certainly hire a non-Japanese, or expatriate for this role.
However, in that case, selecting someone who brings industry connections, and most
importantly cultural understanding and sensitivity, can make or break your other talent
attraction efforts.


Examples in the offshore wind industry:
Here are some examples that best illustrate the points made above.

Earlier this year, our firm helped one Japanese professional, a man in his mid 30s at a
major oil and gas firm, to change career for the first time. He was interested in
offshore wind, and so he met with a handful of companies. He received a lot of
interest, but his final choice was not the biggest of the firms in contention. His new
employer, however, had the following:
●  A Japanese country leader from a top trading house, plus a well-connected
Japanese advisor who could leverage his network of partners and financiers - akin to
the value of a board member;
●  A strong, multi-project partnership with a major Japanese energy conglomerate
over multiple bidding rounds;
●  Their own office space, set up as a KK;
●  A previous track record of hiring from major Japanese utilities, the EPCOs.

Another case was when a European energy giant entered the Japanese offshore wind
market quite late, establishing an entity here well after the results of Round 1 auctions
came out last December. Though this could be seen as a disadvantage, they made
certain strategic decisions that made them a prospective employer of choice for many
Japanese professionals:


21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

●  Set up a KK and established an office in a prime location, close to important and
influential partners, METI etc.;
●  Hired a foreign country manager who has lived in Japan for a long time, traded
with Japan for over a decade, speaks decent Japanese, and has excellent local
cultural knowledge;
●  Established partnerships with top-level Japanese partners in a respectful
manner, bringing humility, technical expertise and options to work on projects also
outside Japan.

Overall, Japan has always been seen as a long-term investment in terms of business
development. The talent market is exactly the same. That’s why offering long term
prospects in your firm will often help you acquire the best people.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Argentina/ Gas pipeline
Argentina secured $689 million from Brazil’s state bank, BNDES, to finance the
second stage of a natural gas pipeline in the Vaca Muerta shale region. The first stage,
which will link Vaca Muerta with the area near Buenos Aires, will be finished in June
2023.

China/ LNG tankers
Three Chinese shipyards won about 30% of this year's record orders for 163 new gas
carriers, boosting that nation’s market share in a sector usually dominated by South
Korea.

Coal demand
Global coal consumption is set to rise to an all-time high this year, rising 1.2% and
exceeding 8 billion tons; the previous record was set in 2013. In India, coal demand
saw a 7% increase. In Germany coal-powered generation output rose 13.3% YoY.

ESG
Facing strong criticism over its climate change policies, HSBC will cut direct financing
and advisory ties to new oil and gas fields and coal projects. However, the decision
does not restrict financing of energy companies with plans to expand.

Germany/ Energy crisis
To keep the lights on, Berlin has spent an unplanned €440 billion on energy this year
due to the Ukraine war and anti-Russian sanctions. That's the cumulative total of
government bailouts and efforts to prop up the country's energy system, according to
a Reuters report.

India/ Nuclear power
In addition to 11 reactors under construction, the govt approved building ten 700 MW
pressurized heavy water reactors. Also approved were five sites for future NPPs.
India’s current nuclear power capacity of 6.8 GW will increase to 22.5 GW by 2031.

India/ Renewable energy
In 2023, India might attract up to $10 billion investment in renewable energy, said
Kaku Nakhate, Bank of America’s head for India. “People take us seriously. That’s why
we’re seeing more sustainability funds that want to invest in India,” she said.

Norway/ Natural gas
Germany's Wintershall Dea, along with Petoro and Sval Energi, will invest $800 million
to develop the Dvalin North offshore gas field on the Norwegian shelf. Its ‘boe’
volume is estimated at 84 million, most of it natural gas.

Oil prices
Goldman Sachs slashed its oil price forecasts for 2023, expecting a market surplus.
OPEC, however, disagrees and forecasts global oil demand rising by 2.25 million bpd
in 2023, about 2.3%. OPEC cited the Chinese economy opening up as it relaxes its
zero-COVID policy.

Russia/ Gas exports
President Vladimir Putin wants to increase gas supplies to Asia, particularly China. He
also called to set prices for gas sales to the EU using an electronic platform “in the
next few months… to determine the final price for our European consumers”.

Wind power
EU wind turbine makers will face a tough 2023 due to Chinese competition and higher
production costs. Top EU manufacturers, including Siemens Gamesa, Vestas and
Nordex, are running at a loss, with a return to profitability not expected soon.

U.S./ Shale oil
In January, oil output from the Permian shale basin is set to reach a record 5.6 million
bpd, but the increase is a mere one-third of September's rate. The rise will be about
37,000 bpd, the smallest gain in seven months, according to the EIA.
