NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







As trial carbon trading draws to a close, METI looks to speed up full market launch
(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 6)
•  Trial trading of carbon credits started on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in fall 2022 and is due to
complete at the end of January 2023. It mostly covers trading in J-Credits.
•  Between the trial's start in September and Dec. 8, credits representing a reduction of 34,249 tons
of CO2 were traded at an average unit price of ¥1,927/ ton.
•  METI will now hold interviews with trial participating companies and the Financial Services Agency

to identify issues that need addressing before launching the market in earnest. A report on the trial
period is due in spring. Based on its contents, bureaucrats will proceed to draw a detailed market
design for the emissions trading system.
•  Full trading is still expected to begin by the end of FY2023.
•  CONTEXT: The carbon credit market is a pillar of an emissions trading system for trading GHG
emission allowances. This market will allow companies that reduced more GHG emissions than

planned to sell that excess amount to others that weren’t able to meet their targets.



Auctions for four offshore wind projects start after rule changes
(Government statement, Dec. 28)
•  The government started the offshore wind power auction in four areas: Happo Noshiro in Akita
prefecture, Murakami-Tainai coast in Niigata prefecture, Oga-Katagami-Akita coast in Akita

prefecture and Saikai-Eshima coast in Nagasaki prefecture.
•  The government will apply the new FIP system to all four areas. There will be an upper limit on the
supply price: ¥19/ kWh for the first three areas, where monopile type foundations are expected to
be used, and ¥29/ kWh for Saikai-Eshima, where projects will likely use jacket type foundations.
Each auction will be for a 30-year occupancy period.
•  An explanatory meeting will be held on Jan 13 from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm.
•  Bid will be accepted until 5pm on June 30.

•  CONTEXT: Auction rules were revised last year following the Mitsubishi consortium winning three
projects in the December 2021 auction. That decision was highly controversial and led to an uproar
in the industry.



METI proposes raising GHG cuts for gasoline vehicles

(Japan NRG, Dec. 28)
•  METI proposed raising the GHG reduction goal for the transport sector to 60% of gasoline-derived
emissions from 55% currently.


4


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  In 2023, METI will conduct a fact-finding survey on GHG emissions in the gasoline life cycle; this
follows its review of the U.S. and Brazilian bioethanol life cycle.
•  It proposes to keep the national bioethanol consumption goal at 0.5 mln oil-equivalent kiloliters/
year; Domestic bioethanol supply will probably see meager growth in the next five years.
•  CONTEXT: METI has been studying the possibility of blending more bioethanol into gasoline to

cut vehicle emissions. The proposals comprise the 2023-2027 national green energy goals under
the Act of Advancement of Energy Supply Structures. The government opened the goal proposals
to the general public for comments. Feedback submissions close on January 17.
• TAKEAWAY: Some experts claim increasing bioethanol content in gasoline would not only help reduce
emissions but may also make gasoline cheaper depending on international crude and bioethanol market
conditions. However, bioethanol applications are not limited to vehicle fuel but they could potentially expand

to bioplastics and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Bioplastics and SAF promise better profit margins than
vehicle fuel, according to METI findings.


METI signs bilateral hydrogen and ammonia agreements with Saudi Arabia and Oman

(Japan NRG, Dec. 27)
•  METI minister Nishimura visited Saudi Arabia and Oman at the end of December where he signed
a MoC on hydrogen, ammonia, circular carbon economy and carbon recycling.
•  Nishimura also met with the Omani Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources and signed an MoC
on cooperation in the decarbonization sector.
•  They also discussed overall cooperation in developing Oman-Japan relations; in 2022 the countries

celebrated the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic relations.
•  CONTEXT: METI and JOGMEC are signing hydrogen/ ammonia MoCs with multiple countries and
companies that have access to cheap renewable energy in a bid to build diverse supply chains. In
the private sector, ENEOS has signed MoCs with Malaysia’s Petronas and Australia’s FMG, and the
parties have started hydrogen feasibility studies.
• TAKEAWAY: China, Australia, Canada, Norway and the Middle Eastern countries are generally seen as
potential green hydrogen/ ammonia supply giants.



IAEA reviews safety of treated discharged water at Fukushima NPP

(METI statement, Jan. 4)
•  The IAEA published a safety review of the discharge of ALPS (Advanced Liquid Processing System)
treated water at TEPCO's Fukushima NPP.
•  The IAEA’s review will continue during and after the ALPS treated water discharge. The IAEA task
force consists of IAEA officials and international experts.
•  The report is intended to instill confidence in the accuracy of the data provided by TEPCO and
Japanese authorities.
• TAKEAWAY: METI classifies “contaminated water” and “ALPS treated water” differently. “Contaminated

water” contains a large amount of radioactive material, but “treated water” has had most radionuclides
removed by purification systems (such as ALPS) to meet regulatory standards for discharge, with the exception
of tritium, which can’t be removed. There’s no tritium separation technology for treated water with low
concentrations and large volumes.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO President: need more credibility before releasing treated water into the ocean
(Fukushima Minyu Shimbun, Jan. 5)
o  TEPCO President Kobayakawa said it’s important to build credibility inside and outside of

Japan before releasing the treated water of the Fukushima accident.
o  The company plans to be transparent about secure safety and reassurances.
o  However, he added that it’s difficult to judge how much credibility has been built so far,
and how to describe the status of the broader public’s understanding.
• TAKEAWAY: TEPCO plans to release the treated water in April of 2023. The president’s comments suggest
that the company will go ahead with its plans despite some opposition voices from inside and outside of
Japan. But this is clearly a very sensitive topic and the government has been at pains to explain that the

treated water release plan was approved by several international bodies, including the IAEA. No matter what
Japan says, China will likely lodge a protest and, depending on the political relations at the time, there may be
some criticism from South Korea also.

NRA to set transition period to new reactor licensing system at “one to three years”
(Mainichi Shimbun, Dec. 26)
•  The NRA held a meeting with nuclear plant operating companies to discuss their view on the new
reactor licensing system. The system keeps the maximum life of a reactor as 60 years but allows
the years spent idle post Fukushima to be discounted. It also specifies that all units will need a

safety review every decade once they reach 30 years in service.
•  Companies said they will need time to adjust to the new system. The NRA said it would allow for a
one-to-three-year transition to the new rules.
•  CONTEXT: After the new system is introduced, approvals issued under the old one won’t be
eligible. Therefore, all operators with reactors that are 30 years or older will need to pass the new
review. This is what the transition period is for.
• TAKEAWAY: As of now, 17 reactors have reached the 30 years of service mark and six of them have restarted:

Mihama Unit 3 (46 years); Ohi Unit 3 (31 years); Takahama Unit 3 (37 years); Takahama Unit 4 (37 years); Sendai
Unit 1 (38 years); and Sendai Unit 2 (37 years). Another four reactors on the list have NRA approval but have
not restarted due to local opposition.

GX sees stand-alone battery business developing around 2030
(New Energy Business News, Dec. 27)
•  The government’s GX strategy forecasts the development of a domestic stand-alone storage
battery sector backed by private investment by around FY2030.

•  The state will support private efforts for commercialization and seek to build a market mechanism
that works with distributed power sources like household storage batteries.


Japan to relax rules on fast EV chargers
(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 4)
•  The govt plans to ease rules around installing fast-chargers for EVs.
•  Currently, units with an output of more than 200 kW are subject to strict safety measures, which

makes installation costly. By the end of 2023, rules around fire and disaster management will be
relaxed, thus lowering capex for new fast-charging facilities.
•  CONTEXT: There are no special regulations for chargers with output of 20 kW or below. Things
become progressively stricter above that marker and units with output of 200 kW or more are
treated as electrical substations. In November, EVs accounted for just 2% of new vehicle sales in
Japan, according to auto industry research firm MarkLines. Potential buyers cite the lack of

chargers as the main reason for meager interest.



J-Power and GEI to research making pellets from oil palm waste
(New Energy Business News, Dec. 27)
•  J-Power and the Green Earth Institute (GEI) will research how to develop pellets using oil palm
waste wood. This would create a green chemical/ biofuel business from inedible biomass available

at oil palm plantations in Thailand.
•  CONTEXT: Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the world. Oil palm plantations, which
support this enormous global demand, are regularly replanted to maintain palm fruit yields, and a
large amount of tree waste is created each year. The waste is usually buried onsite, but if
improperly processed, can emit GHGs.



Osaka Gas to study e-methane project in the U.S. with local partners

(Company statement, Dec. 22)
•  Osaka Gas signed an MoU with Tallgrass MLP, which operates energy infrastructure such as natural
gas pipelines, and Green Plains, which operates bioethanol plants. The three will do a feasibility
study for synthetic methane (e-methane) production.
•  Osaka Gas aims for production of up to 200,000 tons per year by 2030, with a view to liquefy it at
the Freeport LNG terminal in Texas and export it to Japan. The process will use biomass-derived

CO2 recovered from bioethanol plants owned by Green Plains and blue hydrogen obtained by
reforming natural gas.
•  The partners will also look at opportunities for utilizing green hydrogen.

IHI wins world's first AiP for ammonia floating storage and regasification barge
(Company Statement, Jan. 5)
•  IHI, NYK Line and Nihon Shipyard obtained an Approval in Principle (AiP) from ClassNK for their
design of an ammonia floating storage and regasification barge (A-FSRB). This apparently is the

first such approval globally.
•  While ammonia is expected to be a potent next-gen fuel that helps with measures to counter
global warming, a large initial investment cost is required to secure land for new onshore facilities,
including storage tanks and regasification facilities.
•  A-FSRB offers the advantages of shorter construction time and lower costs in comparison to
construction of onshore storage tanks and regasification plants. Offshore floating facilities can

receive and store ammonia that has been transported via ship as a liquid, regasify ammonia
according to demand, and then send it to a pipeline onshore.



Toshiba to set up new department to develop next-gen NPPs
(Nikkei, Dec. 28)
•  Toshiba Energy Systems set up an “Innovative Reactor Propulsion Team”, which consists of
engineers and marketers tasked with securing orders for the next-gen NPPs.

•  Toshiba supplies BWR nuclear reactors, the design of the Fukushima NPP.
•  As construction of new NPPs stopped since the Fukushima accident, the most recent one built by
Toshiba is Unit 1 of Higashi-Dori NPP (Tohoku Electric) in December 2005.
• TAKEAWAY: Toshiba acquired Westinghouse in 2006 to become the world’s first major global company to sell
both BWR (Toshiba) and PWR (Westinghouse). However, Toshiba took on Westinghouse’s huge debts, and
their BWR business also faced a crisis. Then, the Fukushima accident set back Japanese NPP suppliers,

including Toshiba. One great challenge for this new Toshiba department should be how to retain engineering
skills, because construction of next-gen nuclear power plants is only set for the 2030s.



Mitsui and European real estate fund launch $500 million climate friendly fund

(Nikkei, Jan. 9)
•  Mitsui & Co. and Patrizia SE, a major European real estate fund, have launched an environmentally
friendly infrastructure fund, "AECIF," to invest in the Asia-Oceania region.
•  The two companies see growth in infrastructure such as renewable energy in the region, and want
to set up a $500 million fund (approx. ¥67 billion) by December 2023.
•  The fund will be managed by Patrizia MBK Fund Management, a 50-50 joint venture in Sydney,

Australia.
•  This is believed to be the first environmentally friendly infrastructure fund established for the Asia-
Oceania region. It will focus on six countries and regions, including Australia, New Zealand,
Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, with an allocation of 50% for renewable energy.

Itochu to enter power management business, remotely control batteries
(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 5)
•  Itochu will enter the electricity management systems business this year. This will include remotely
controlling household storage batteries that source power from solar panels.
•  Itochu’s VPP (virtual power plant) system hopes to improve energy efficiency and avoid power

shortages. The company has sold about 55,000 batteries to homes around Japan.
•  The trading house (through its GridShare subsidiary) will cooperate with TEPCO Energy Partner
and three other power retail firms.



ENEOS to build Japan’s largest energy management system site

(Company statement, Dec. 27)
•  ENEOS contracted Nippon Koei to build a next-gen energy supply system on the site of a former
oil refinery in Shizuoka City. Operations will start in April 2024.
•  It will consist of large-scale solar generation facilities and storage batteries, as well as an energy
management system. The complex promises to be Japan’s largest energy management facility,
covering about 42,000 m2.
•  The complex can work independently from the power grid in times of natural disaster.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

NTT Anode and Shizen Energy join forces to use AI in energy management
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 4)
o  NTT Anode Energy and Shizen Energy will form an alliance in energy management
systems using IoT/AI tech and microgrids.
o  The partners will offer EV smart charge/discharge services, using their system to find
optimal times for charging. Solar power generation equipment and EV recharge/
discharge units (V2B/Vehicle to Building) will be installed in public and private high-

voltage power facilities.
o  CONTEXT: Optimization services help to shift power demand outside of peak times,
thereby lowering costs.



Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy mull merging thermal power generation divisions

(NHK, Dec. 28)
•  Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will study setting up a JV to integrate
their thermal power generation businesses by April 2024. Mitsubishi is expected to become the
majority shareholder of the new company.
•  The JV will cover planning, design, development, manufacturing, sales, and after-sales service of
large generators and related equipment used in power generation.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: MHI leads the global market share for large power plant turbines, but it relied on
Mitsubishi Electric to supply the generators. In 2016, MHI and Hitachi pooled their thermal power
assets into one company, but Hitachi sold its stake in the business to MHI in 2019.
• TAKEAWAY: Mitsubishi Electric and MHI were part of the same Mitsubishi zaibatsu conglomerate before a
forced split post World War 2. After a largely fractious MHI-Hitachi partnership, the latest proposed deal would

consolidate the thermal power business capacities of three of Japan’s top engineering companies.



METI may delay expectation for drop in solar cost, and creates new PV categories

(New Energy Business News, Dec. 27)
•  METI’s pricing committee met at the end of December to discuss solar power generation. The
committee proposed delaying the ministry’s ¥7/ kWh price target for solar generation from FY2025
to FY2028.
•  The ¥7 target was set in FY2018. The committee still believes that very cost-effective projects will
be able to reach ¥5/ kWh in 2028.
•  The committee also suggested splitting PV generation into two distinct groups: ground-mounted

and rooftop-mounted. New classifications for perovskite and other next-gen solar cells will also be
considered later and adopted under the FIT/ FIP systems to help stimulate demand for the
technologies.



HSE plans to develop 150 MW onshore wind farm in Iwate

(New Energy Business News, Jan. 5)
•  HSE plans to develop an onshore wind farm in the vicinity of Karume-cho, Iwate Prefecture. The
maximum output is 150 MW.
•  Construction will begin in FY2026 and operation in FY2028. In the surrounding area, Tokyu Land,
Invenergy, and others are also planning wind projects.
•  CONTEXT: HSE is 85% owned by Mitsubishi HC Capital.




INPEX to acquire 31.45% stock of Indonesian geothermal plant from Engie
(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 5)
•  INPEX invested in Rajabasa Geothermal, its fourth geothermal power plant in Indonesia.
•  Rajabasa was founded by Indonesia’s PT Supreme Energy (19.10%), Sumitomo Corp (40.45%) and
Engie (40.45%). INPEX acquired 31.45% and Sumitomo acquired 9% from Engie.
•  INPEX also opened an office in Jakarta on Oct 10.
•  CONTEXT: Engie sold all shares of this project to two Japanese companies, and Sumitomo

became the largest shareholder.

Kansai Electric gained unauthorized access to customer information since 2016
(Kansai TV, Dec. 28)
•  Kansai Electric gained unauthorized access to new power market client information that’s managed
by Kansai Transmission and Distribution, Inc.

•  Since 2016, Kansai Electric employees were able to gain unauthorized access to company names,
staff names and phone numbers of new power market players.
•  Between Dec 6 and 12 of 2022 alone, 329 Kansai Electric employees and outsourcing company
staff accessed about 1,300 data entries.
• TAKEAWAY: This is the latest scandal to hit Kansai Electric and while it is not directly related to the nuclear
industry, experts worry that the company needs to take compliance more seriously before applying to extend

the operational life of its NPPs. The discovery will also vindicate those that doubt the unbundling of the
EPCOs, the major regional power utilities. With an antitrust probe against several of the EPCOs ongoing, the
timing of this scandal is highly unfortunate for Kansai Electric.




Residents appeal to stop the restart of Kansai Electric’s Mihama nuclear reactor
(MBS News, Jan. 4)
•  On Jan 4, nine residents of Fukui, Shiga and Kyoto prefectures filed an immediate appeal to the
Osaka High Court to overturn the Osaka District Court ruling to dismiss their appeal to stop
operation of Unit 3 of Mihama NPP.
•  Unit 3 is the only reactor to operate beyond its original 40-year license in Japan at present. The

residents claim the NPP is dilapidated, and there are active faults at the site.
•  The Osaka Court ruled on Dec 20 that the measurement of age degradation by the NRA is reliable;
thus, more safety measures aren’t required under new IRA standards.
• TAKEAWAY: After 10 years of cessation following the Fukushima accident, Unit 3 at Mihama restarted in June
2021. This NPP is the oldest in operation in Japan, so Kansai Electric has to be vigilant to prevent even the
slightest problem. Any issue can negatively impact the entire nuclear industry.




Mitsubishi CEO wants more renewables and energy security
(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 2)
•  Mitsubishi CEO Nakanishi Katsuya says the company will spend ¥1.2 trillion on renewables by

FY2024. He sees renewables and nuclear as key to Japan's energy security.
•  He said Japan has tempered gas prices hikes thanks to long-term LNG contracts.
•  He said Mitsubishi is keen to invest in hydrogen and ammonia projects to supply Japan.

JERA has narrowed its potential ammonia suppliers down to 10 companies
(Diamond, Jan. 7)
•  JERA President Onoda said the company has narrowed the number of potential suppliers of
ammonia on a long-term contract, which it announced as a public tender in 2022. It is now looking
at proposals from about 10 companies.
•  JERA’s preparations to move its thermal power plants to use fuel ammonia is progressing well and

the company needs a broad supply chain that will allow large quantities of the fuel to be imported,
Onoda said.



Japan strikes several key LNG deals
(Japan NRG, Dec. 29)
•  INPEX and JERA agreed to a major long-term LNG supply deal, reversing a trend of Japanese

firms running down such contracts.
•  While domestic demand has softened over the past few years due to Covid, high LNG prices and
the restart of more nuclear capacity, the government is supporting gas imports. For example,
JOGMEC will assume the investment risk in new upstream projects, and buy “spare” LNG cargoes
if domestic demand lags. This encourages Japanese importers to make purchases based on a
high-demand scenario, covering the risk of losses.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

INPEX inks 20-year LNG deal with Venture Global in the U.S.
(Japan NRG, Dec. 28)
o  Japan’s top oil and gas explorer, INPEX, agreed to buy 1 mln tons of LNG per year for 20
years from Venture Global in the state of Louisiana.
o  The deal is on the basis of “free-on-board”, which means the buyer has flexibility to
choose the cargo’s destination.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan, Oman agree on terms of 2.35 mln tons/ year LNG supply
(Japan NRG, Company statements, Jiji, Dec. 27)
o  Mitsui, Itochu and JERA, and Oman LNG signed a contract to supply 2.35 mln tons/ year
of LNG over a 10-year period. The METI minister and Oman’s Energy Minister Salim Al-
Aufi attended the signing ceremony.
o  The countries will continue negotiations on more issues such as shipping schedules.

o  The contract is unlikely to include a destination clause and would allow Japanese buyers
to sell the cargoes outside of Japan, a source close to the talks told Japan NRG.
o  JERA alone accounts for 0.8 mln tons of the deal total.
o  METI minister Nishimura said Oman’s location makes it less likely to be affected by
geopolitical factors.


12


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Other Japanese companies are also in talks with Oman on LNG supply. Mitsui, Itochu,
Mitsubishi and Osaka Gas all have stakes in an LNG project in Oman.
o  CONTEXT: 2.35 mln tons/ year is nearly equivalent to the current import amount from
Oman. Oman currently provides less than 3% of Japan’s total LNG imports.
• TAKEAWAY: The deals will help Japan find alternative supplies to Russian gas. However, both the Oman and

the U.S. deals won’t start deliveries until around 2025. They’ll total under 3.4 million tons, compared to the 6
million tons or so that Russia sends to Japan each year. Also, several Japanese long-term deals are expiring.
JERA decided not to renew a 5.5 mtpa deal with Qatar at the end of 2021, while Itochu has an 0.7 mtpa Oman
contract that expires in 2025. So, from Tokyo’s point of view, the new deals create necessary options in a very
tight market. But they cannot be used to walk away from Sakhalin-2 LNG cargoes.




Tokyo Gas seeks to buy U.S. natural gas producer for about $4.6 billion
(Reuters, Jan. 4)
•  A unit of Tokyo Gas is in talks to buy U.S. natural gas producer Rockcliff Energy for about $4.6
billion, including debt. The seller is equity firm Quantum Energy Partners.

•  The all-cash deal may be announced later this month.
•  The buyer would be Houston-based TG Natural Resources, which is 70% owned by Tokyo Gas and
30% by Castleton Commodities International.
•  Rockcliff produces over 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Haynesville shale
formation in Louisiana and East Texas.
•  CONTEXT: Tokyo Gas sold minority stakes in several Australian LNG projects at the end of 2022.

The U.S. deal would give it more exposure to upstream operations.



Japan seeks to minimize reliance on China for critical raw materials
(Asia Nikkei, Dec. 21)
•  Japan designated 11 areas, including semiconductors, batteries and machine tools as “strategically
critical” and vowed to lessen reliance on China for supplies.
•  Bolstering national security means finding new supply options and building stockpiles.

•  The change will affect battery manufacturers such as Panasonic, which had sourced much from
China, for example, raw materials like graphite. Tokyo will lend as much as ¥1 trillion in support for
companies to invest in new mining to diversify sources.
•  The initiative is spearheaded by Economic Security Ministry Sanae Takaichi. The risk of conflict over
Taiwan is one concern driving the policy change.
•  CONTEXT: Around the start of the previous decade, China banned the export of rare-earth metals

to Japan over border disputes. This spurred some Japanese firms to research machinery and motor
designs that utilize less rare-earths or rely on those elements more readily available.

Japan to continue insurance for Russian LNG cargoes
(Nikkei, Dec. 30)
•  After concerns that Japanese insurers will need to stop covering ships sailing though Russian
waters from Jan. 1, the companies seem to have reversed direction.

•  METI’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy asked the three main insurers to continue
offering war-risk coverage so as not to disrupt energy deliveries.
•  Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance, Sompo Japan Insurance and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance
relented and will keep the insurance available but scaled back the coverage.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan imported 0.45 mln tons of Russian LNG in Nov

(Government data, Dec. 28)
o  Japan imported 0.45 mln tons of LNG from Russia in Nov, out of the 5.55 mln tons total.
Australia Imports were 2.31 mln tons; Malaysia 1.12 mln tons; Brunei 0.26 mln tons.
o  Japan did not import any crude oil from Russia.



LNG stocks at 2.41 mln tons at end-2022

(Government data, Dec. 28)
•  As of Dec 25, LNG stocks of 10 power grids stood at 2.41 mln tons, down from 2.44 mln tons a
week earlier. The end-December stocks last year were 2.34 mln tons. The five-year average for this
time of year is 1.84 mln tons.
•  METI has not updated figures for Jan 1.

TOP INTERVIEW:
MOE’s Point Man for the JCM Program Outlines Expansion Plans

Japan expects to facilitate the development of high integrity carbon markets around
the world. Such an approach could allow financing from wealthy nations to flow to
decarbonizing technology and infrastructure in developing economies. The end result
should be more funds for the latter and also a reduction in global GHG output. But
there are several challenges to orchestrating this kind of exchange.

One of the countries with the most experience in international carbon transfer
happens to be Japan. It has implemented the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) for a
decade, which is a program that promotes the deployment of decarbonizing
technology and infrastructure by verifying credits for and funding projects conducted
by Japanese firms to reduce GHG emissions in JCM Partner countries. The credit for
the GHG emission reduction is allocated between the JCM Partner country where the
project takes place and Japan.

This year, the topic of carbon credits will likely reach a whole new level: 2023 is the
inaugural year for implementing the carbon market mechanism alignment according
to the rules of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Japan NRG sat down with the Ministry
of Environment’s Shigematsu Takayuki, the Planning Officer for JCM, to discuss the
evolution of the mechanism and its expansion.


EXPANDING THE JCM PROGRAM
What’s exciting about 2023?

In 2023, the Paris Agreement Article 6 Implementation Partnership will start its activities.
While the programs related to it will only just get started, Japan will celebrate a decade of
operating the JCM. Under the JCM scheme, Japan is facilitating diffusion of leading
decarbonizing technologies and infrastructure, etc. as well as implementation of
mitigation actions in partner countries. The JCM contribute to the achievement of both
countries’ NDCs while ensuring the avoidance of double counting through corresponding
adjustments. Only Japan and Switzerland have experience with such international
frameworks. Japan will be happy to help other countries understand the workings of an
exchange mechanism and develop things further.

The JCM program has a 2030 goal of registering credits equivalent to the reduction of
100 million tons of CO2. You also hope to boost the number of participating countries to
30 from the current 25. What’s the latest status of the program?

As of December 2022, a total of 227 emissions-reduction projects have been
implemented in 17 countries. These projects are expected to generate credits
cumulatively equivalent to 19 million tons of CO2 by 2030. It’s a significant number but
far short of the ultimate goal. So, we need more projects, and we need bigger projects.
Of course, small projects are just as important and they add up, but bigger projects do
have better cost efficiency.


15


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

On the other hand, many small and medium-sized companies are also participating in
JCM, expanding projects in collaboration with partner countries and contributing not only
to GHG reduction but also to SDGs such as sanitation and food issues.

With that in mind, we plan to expand the scope of JCM to include projects that are fully
funded by the private sector. The existing 227 projects all received government grants.
We want to increase the number of private companies that implement the JCM scheme
but do so entirely on their own. We plan to publish guidance that will elaborate what
companies need to take note of when registering their emission reductions; how to apply
the JCM rules; what are the verification processes, and how to avoid double counting of
credits. This guidance will be released and formally announced before March 2023. The
business community, represented by the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren), has
been supportive of JCM’s growth.

Non-Japanese entities have had limited access to JCM so far since all projects must
involve a Japanese company. That’s because the projects receive government grants. We
have a platform that matches global businesses with Japanese companies to carry out
JCM projects. This platform is called “JCM Global Match”.

JCM was intended to transfer technology to developing countries but there is no rule that
clearly excludes UNFCCC’s Annex I parties1. Such categorization may not be that relevant
anyway as situations change. If there’s a need to include projects in industrial economies
as part of the JCM program, that could be possible. But at this very moment, demand for
JCM implementation comes from developing nations.

JCM projects can be categorized into: energy efficiency, renewable energy, waste, and
transport. Most projects fall into the first two categories. We haven’t touched CCS (carbon
capture and storage) tech as a means to cut emissions, but we could go into that
direction in the future.

For now, we plan to reach out to countries in Africa, Central and South America and the
Pacific islands as a way to boost JCM’s partnership network to 30 countries by 2025. Most
countries have announced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and need to
reduce emissions. They may have their own initiatives, but JCM would be another option.
Developing countries are attracted by the financial and technology support that Japan
offers via JCM.


MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
Will credits verified via JCM be integrated with the Japanese carbon trading market,
which is in a trial phase2 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange?

There is a possibility, but it’s not confirmed. The purpose of offset credits is to stimulate
ever higher emission reduction goals. Credits are not meant to reduce carbon volumes
with money. We need to strengthen our ambition to pursue further GHG emission.

GLOBAL COOPERATION
At COP27, Japan established the Paris Agreement Article 6 Implementation Partnership
with 40 countries and 23 institutions. What activities are planned for it in 2023?
2023 will be the inaugural year for the Implementation Partnership. We’ll begin by
deepening our understanding of Article 6 and offering support to create high integrity
carbon markets.

The most challenging part of implementing an Article 6 framework is setting the
institutional arrangements to authorize and allocate credits among parties while avoiding
double-counting, and establishing methodologies for new technologies such as CCS.

The methodologies used for renewables and for energy efficiency are similar across
countries. With that, it should be possible to disseminate JCM methodologies more
globally.


How do you see the carbon market evolving under Article 6 implementation?
New types of credits may emerge within the Article 6 framework. Japanese tech might
find application in Australia and the U.S., for example. As the scope of credits expands,
it’s important to ensure that there is no double counting. Credits will also likely become
more diversified. There will be so-called “good” credits and “bad” credits. The former
credits are backed by solid processes and systems, and have credibility.

I also believe credits could be worth more than their “face value.” We should look into
the various positive impacts these projects have. For example, how much they help local
residents by reducing air pollution and improving sanitation.

At the time of the interview, 46 countries and 24 international organizations are part of
the Implementation Partnership. Among the major emitters, the U.S., India, and Germany
have joined. Among the organizations involves are UN entities, financial institutions such
as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and the International Emissions
Trading Association. One of our goals is to increase the membership number to 100. We
have received several inquiries from the private sector and are discussing ways to involve
them in the Partnership.

We will reach out for collaboration through newsletters and through an information
platform, which will launch next year. That will report on our progress as well as offering
insights on how to effectively run Article 6 initiatives at international forums and so on.

TOP INTERVIEW:
Japan’s Top Trader of Battery Metals Discusses 2023 Outlook

Raw material prices have skyrocketed in the last 18 months, causing a headache for
both consumers of fossil fuels and clean energy tech. The price of solar projects, for
example, is up by a third in some cases, while wind turbine and battery makers have
struggled to turn a profit despite strong demand for their products.

This year promises to be less volatile for raw materials, but it’s too early to breathe a
sigh of relief. Japan NRG spoke with Tomono Junichi, a corporate officer for the
Primary Metal Unit at Hanwa Co., Ltd., a key Japanese upstream investor and trader of
metals used in batteries. He offers a 2023 outlook for critical materials such as lithium,
nickel and cobalt, and details expected changes in the battery supply chain.


2023 PRICE OUTLOOK
In 2023, LNG and other fossil fuel prices are forecast to stay high. What’s your outlook
for battery metals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt?

The price direction for these metals is generally on the up. It’s hard to see prices
decline with such robust demand for batteries. I see lithium trading in the $70-90/ kg
range compared to $30-85/kg during 2022. Prices are at historically high levels but
demand continues to grow. Market records could be broken again.

My nickel outlook is for $22,000-32,000/ ton in 2023, and $15-30/ lb for cobalt. That
compares with a range of $20,000-$48,000 for nickel and $18-38/ lb for cobalt last
year.

Spot lithium supplies are extremely tight. Consumers need to book material via long-
term contracts because spot sellers are difficult to find. Suppliers are prioritizing deals
with long-term customers. Even if you offer double the current spot price, you might
still struggle to find a willing seller. For new market entrants that’s especially tough.
Sellers will typically run checks on new prospective clients before deciding on whether
to accept them as a buyer.

Nickel is easier to procure. New supply sources have emerged in Indonesia thanks to
the emergence of a new remelting and processing technique that refines Class-III
nickel matte into Class-I battery grade material. So, it’s likely that nickel supplies will
ramp up in 2023.

The cobalt market is soft, presently trading at around $19/ lb. Cobalt has trended
down since the summer of 2022 due to weak demand for digital devices in China.
However, the spread of Covid in China could actually hit the metal’s supply side pretty
heavily. China accounts for 60% of the world’s intermediate cobalt processing
capacity. It would make cobalt prices very volatile this year and the development of
the pandemic in China could cut both ways.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

In 2022, lithium-ion battery prices rose to $151/kWh from $141/kWh in 2021,
according to BNEF, which expects the rally to continue this year. My outlook is in line
with their forecast, which is for $152/ kWh in 2023.

Raw materials are perennially in a boom-then-bust cycle. Do you currently see any
chance of prices suddenly plunging to levels that are below cost of production?

I don’t see any chance of that happening, unless there’s some major incident. Nickel
production costs are around $15,000/ ton or less. I could see nickel hitting $18,000,
but not $12,000 or less. Likewise, I don’t think we’ll see lithium drop below $70/ kg
thanks to EV demand. Cobalt may slide somewhat but will likely stop at $15/ lb.

How will high metal prices affect the battery supply chain?

The battery business model is showing its limitation because a rise in battery demand
is not leading to lower costs. An economy of scale was supposed to emerge as the
rollout of EVs led to higher demand and hence lower costs. But the rising demand for
batteries is actually increasing their cost. EV makers like Tesla are raising prices. So,
the obvious question is: how will that impact EV demand? Will buyers accept the
elevated price tags, which end up being even higher because of rising interest rates?

We have to see if automakers manage to sell several million units of EVs a year and
retain the sector’s momentum despite cost increases. Even if EV demand momentum
holds, raw material supply volumes will not be able to keep up with demand. You
can’t use just any lithium, nickel or cobalt to make batteries. These metals have to be
of a certain purity and other quality standards, otherwise the batteries could explode.

ALTERNATIVES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES
But industry needs cheaper battery solutions. Do they exist?

Presently, EVs dominate battery demand. Storage batteries for power utilities have a
very negligible market share. There is talk of sodium-ion batteries as a cheaper
alternative to lithium-ion batteries. For storage battery systems, new technologies
such as vanadium-based redox flow and NAS (sodium sulfide) batteries have been
developed. But these technologies are in their infancy. Their commercial installations
are limited in number and are unlikely to impact lithium-ion battery demand at least in
the next year or so.

One recent trend in EV batteries is to use less cobalt and more nickel, in part due to
safety issues. But if cobalt prices soften, could the trend reverse?
That’s impossible. That said, each time industry has looked to increase its
consumption of cobalt prices have jumped. Such volatility prevents a stronger move
to cobalt.


SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS
The spread between lithium carbonate, the raw material, and lithium hydroxide, which
goes into batteries, has been unstable. How has this affected the supply chain?

Lower hydroxide prices have benefited battery makers and carmakers. Higher
carbonate prices hurt profit margins for hydroxide producers.
At the moment, hydroxide trades above carbonate. The spread flips back and forth.

Constraints on the raw material supply chain suggests Japan should make more
upstream investments in mining to secure access to the so-called “minor” metals
(such as rare earths) needed for batteries. And yet, Japanese investors tend to focus
primarily on base metals (iron, copper), with Hanwa, Toyota Tsusho and Sojitz the
exceptions. Why so?

Rare earth metal projects are smaller in size and market volume compared to base
metals, so perhaps companies find them to be less attractive on an economic basis?
My strategy has been to get our hands on anything that has to do with batteries and
be a step ahead of the others. Hanwa has developed a complete rare metal supply
portfolio including scrap.

There are plenty of “minor” metal deposits waiting to be explored around the world.
What could governments overseas do to attract Japanese investments?

Japan is starting to look around and is making some progress. For example, there was
recent news about a Japanese trading house forming a JV with a Canadian
exploration company to develop nickel deposits in Canada. I think subsidies will be
key to attract Japanese investors. I’ve heard provinces in Canada are offering
subsidies. Many governments in South America don’t have deep enough pockets to
offer the same, but they can still take measure to guarantee lower development costs.
That would certainly be appreciated.

GLOBAL       ANALYSIS

B Y JOHN VAROLI

2023 Global Energy Outlook: Key Trends and Concerns
The global economy will continue to face turmoil in 2023 in part due to recent
underinvestment in energy. The good news is that the issue is now widely
acknowledged and both state and private funds are starting to pour into all forms of
energy. We expect this year to mark a genuine boom in energy investments in terms
of capital allocated to new projects and R&D, government programs, green finance
issuances and M&A.

Looking back on Japan NRG’s 2022 predictions from a year ago, we successfully
recognized the trend toward more nuclear and fossil fuels in the global energy mix.
However, like most everyone else, we didn’t expect such a drastic shift. The speed of
change was dictated by a black swan event — the outbreak of full-scale war in eastern
Europe. Since then, global energy systems have undergone a real-life stress test as
sanctions and geopolitics upended decades-old trade flows.

What we also couldn’t foresee was the unprecedented levels of state intervention in
energy markets. Governments on both sides of the new geo-political divide no longer
hesitate to take action to control markets through price levers (e.g. caps), supply-side
manipulation (e.g. stock releases and the creation of new reserves), and political
filters. Talk of a decoupling between the U.S. and China simmered for years, but the
war in Ukraine led to an open demarcation of consumers as belonging to “friendly”
and “unfriendly” nations. This trend will surely accelerate in 2023.

The 2022 trend that households felt most prominently, however, was a return of high
energy prices. That theme will continue this year despite government attempts to use
subsidies to shield consumers. Should the IMF's grim economic outlook for the first
half of 2023 hold true, a slowdown in Europe, China and the U.S. will help cool energy
prices in the latter part of the year.

Energy pragmatism and security concerns will remain the dominant government and
corporate guidance. While the pace of investments in clean energy projects will also
rise, their immediate impact will be less pronounced. Most obviously this will put
further pressure on state and business leaders to explain how they can reach 2030
emission reduction goals. The answer will increasingly be via some form of carbon
credits and/or taxation. The latter assumes a stronger economy, so the former will
likely gain more traction in the near term.

Let’s take a look at the major energy sectors and their prospects for 2023.

Nuclear
In 2022, the ghosts of the 2011 Fukushima accident were banished. Many countries
now embrace nuclear power, seeing it a vital component of a reliable, carbon-free
energy system. The U.S. — which has the world’s largest nuclear fleet, with 93
reactors — saw private investment grow with federal support. New legislation will
inject about $40 billion into nuclear power over the next decade. Nuclear sceptics in
Europe are also becoming reluctant converts. None more so than Germany, which
postponed closing its three remaining nuclear plants until April and then sparked a
debate around further extensions. France, Poland, Romania and the Netherlands are

21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

among the EU nations planning to add new nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, the vast size
of China’s plans could see it emerge as the nuclear industry leader by the end of this
decade.

Oil
This year will be another bonanza for energy companies trading in fossil fuels, though
without the wild profits seen in 2022. Barring an unexpected geopolitical event, there
shouldn’t be a sharp spike in oil prices, which will probably hover between $80 and
$100/ barrel. Even more significant is that a new and unusual era in oil markets will
coalesce in 2023. Due to western sanctions on Russian exports the global oil market
will split. Russian energy exports that once flowed to the EU now head to India and
China. U.S. exports will increasingly flow to Europe and to Asian allies. How prices are
formed in these two markets will impact us for years to come.

LNG/ Gas
The record prices of 2022 are unlikely to repeat, but LNG and natural gas will enjoy
another robust year. Prices should remain high but stable. EU countries lowered
dependence on Russian gas by turning to Norway and the U.S., along with
accelerating plans to build clean energy sources. But without Russian supplies it will
be difficult to refill Europe’s storage facilities in the run-up to next winter. Japan is
forging ahead with LNG, thanks to its latest slew of major deals, and is back as the
world’s top importer based on last year’s volumes.

Coal
Just a year ago, the industry seemed in terminal decline, but 2022 was coal’s best
year in over a decade. According to FT data, total earnings of the world's 20 largest
coal miners hit $98 billion in 2022, compared to $28 billion in 2021. Major economies
such as India, China and even Germany will continue to increase coal use in 2023
because they’re far from installing sufficient clean energy capacity. Japan is in no rush
to retire coal-fired power plants and will continue to rely on them for backup when
power demand surges and LNG reserves dwindle. Since energy security and
pragmatism will remain paramount in 2023, coal can count on another strong year.

Solar and Wind
By the end of 2023, renewables are expected to account for nearly 33% of the world’s
electricity production, with solar PV’s reaching almost 60% (about 697 GW) of growth,
according to the IEA. The high prices for energy manifest the benefits of energy
efficiency and are stimulating new technologies to reduce consumption. However,
high prices for everything is a double-edged sword, also making the building of clean
energy capacity more costly. State subsidies are seen as a cure and the Inflation
Reduction Act in the U.S. will provide a shot in the arm for the domestic renewables
industry. But it has also upset the EU and Japan, which fear the U.S. will lure clean
energy firms away from their shores.

The U.S. plans to build 57 GW of new wind and solar capacity in the next two years.
That should help to influence other countries to stay the course on the energy
transition. But the U.S. is not the only big spender on green tech. The EU has a €300
billion clean energy strategy to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports. China plans a
33% increase of solar and wind capacity this year, and Japan’s offshore wind tenders
are set to finally resume in 2023 after a year-long debate over rules. With all the major
markets seeking to accelerate the rollout of wind and solar at the same time, China is
likely to be a major winner in global equipment orders because of its market size.

Hydrogen
More than any region of the globe, the EU is betting big on hydrogen to power its
energy transition. The bloc has set up a €3 billion investment vehicle to “guarantee
the purchase of hydrogen” by spurring demand. Also, Norway and Germany plan to
build a blue hydrogen pipeline between the two countries by 2030, and the EU’s
recent $50 billion green hydrogen deal with Kazakhstan could be an energy
gamechanger for the bloc. In 2023, this energy source will continue to enjoy much
favor from governments and private investors.

Biomass
For the first time in many years, high energy prices led to a record number of people
losing access to modern energy. As many as 100 million people, mostly in Africa and
India, will turn to traditional biomass for simple tasks such as cooking and heating.
However, even in Europe, wood burning made an ignominious comeback this winter.
A more positive industry development is seen in the biofuels sector with global
aviation urgently seeking non-fossil options for jet fuel. Though over a decade in the
making, Sustainable Aviation Fuel usage looks likely to finally take off, with Japan
eager to be a leader in this sector.
