NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY







Starting FY2024, Japan will ask EV makers to report CO2 emitted during production
(Nikkei Asia, May 9)
•  Starting FY2024, Japan plans to mandate that EV makers disclose the CO2 volume released during
battery production, to determine eligibility for subsidies.
•  Initially, battery emissions will only be reported to METI but eventually consumers will also have

access to this information.
•  The government may impose a cap on emissions, which would prevent vehicles exceeding the
limit from receiving subsidies.
•  CONTEXT: Although EVs have minimal emissions during operation, they are believed to emit twice
as much CO2 as gasoline vehicles during manufacturing. Up to 60% of all CO2 emitted by EVs
comes from battery production.



Trading of TOCOM electricity futures in 2022 rose 50%; May volume is record high
(Denki Shimbun, May 9)
•  TOCOM’s trading of electricity futures rose 49.7% in FY2022, to 1,561 GWh.
•  In reaction to the sharp price hike of Spot Market (Day Ahead Market) traded at JEPX, the demand
to fix electricity prices showed a substantial increase.
•  In May, monthly trading volume reached over 200 GWh for the first time. One reason was that

prediction accuracy was ahead of the high demand season.
•  CONTEXT: In the summer, electricity markets tend to be volatile, which makes price forecasting
difficult. However, in May, since trading is not so active, traders find it easier to forecast. This is
why trading increased in May 2022, even when fuel prices were uncertain following the start of war
in Ukraine in February 2022.
• TAKEAWAY: Power trading volumes are up in Japan in general. The two main platforms for electricity futures
in the country are the TOCOM, which is part of the JPX exchange group, and the EEX. Trading volume on the

EEX almost doubled in February from a month earlier to approach 2,500 GWh. Greater interest in power
futures is attributed to increased price volatility and uncertainty, as well as a push to have more market
participants deploy risk-hedging strategies.



Record energy prices propel Mitsui to surpass ¥1 trillion in profit, a first for Japan
(Business Nikkei, May 10)
•  Mitsui reported a 23.6% YoY increase in profit, reaching ¥1.13 trillion in FY2022, the company’s
first time exceeding ¥1 trillion and a first among trading companies.
•  The growth was primarily attributed to the energy sector, which benefited from the combined
effect of a weaker yen, and higher oil and gas prices.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The company lowered its 3-year profit plan to ¥920 billion, assuming that the current "strong
tailwind" driving profits will subside in the next three years.
• TAKEAWAY: Record energy prices last year helped propel profits at major oil and gas suppliers around the
world and Mitsui is no exception. The most energy-reliant of Japan's trading houses, Mitsui is heavily invested
in both resource extraction, processing, and retail. Its biggest assets in the field include a stake in Russia's

Sakhalin-2 LNG project, investments in Mozambique and Australian LNG developments, and a shale gas and
pipelines business in the U.S. It is also involved in energy distribution in Brazil, Mexico and North America, as
well as ranking among the top Japanese importers of iron ore from Australia.



Deliberations start for GX Decarbonization Power Supply Law
(Denki Shimbun, May 11)
•  The Committee on Economy and Industry in the House of Councillors began discussions on the GX
Decarbonization Power Supply bill.
•  At the Q&A, a Komeito Party member said the GX policy would be incongruous with the Sixth
Strategic Energy Plan, which calls for less nuclear energy. METI Minister Nishimura replied that

nuclear power’s share won’t exceed 30%, which was the share at the time of the Fukushima
accident, and it will eventually be lessened.
• TAKEAWAY: The GX Decarbonization Power Supply bill was passed during the House of Representatives
plenary session on April 27, with some amendments. Now, the bill has been sent back to the House of
Councillors to deliberate on the amended parts.



New 2040 hydrogen goal highly ambitious: FEPC
(Japan NRG, May 8)
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPC) told an ANRE panel, which is rewriting the
2017 Basic Hydrogen Strategy, that the new goal to supply 12 million tons of hydrogen in 2040,

(up from 3 million tons in 2030), was highly ambitious.
•  The FEPC urged ANRE to include in the revised hydrogen strategy the necessary steps to reach
this goal, as well as challenges that the relevant industries need to clear.
•  It also asked ANRE to include measures to support local hydrogen production, which might be
hampered by low cost imports. Until domestic renewable costs drop, the govt’s support for local
renewables needs to be clarified, FEPC said.
•  CONTEXT: In revising the 2017 Basic Hydrogen Strategy, ANRE plans to add new targets: the

water electrolysis capacity target of 15 GW by 2030, and the 2040 hydrogen supply target of 12
million tons that stands between the goal of 3 million tons in 2030 and 20 million tons in 2050.


MoE launches study group on environmental impact of offshore floating wind stations
(Japan NRG, May 11)
•  The MoE set up a group to study the long-term environmental impact of floating wind power
stations. The 13-member panel comprises experts from academia, the Central Research Institute of

Electric Power Industry and the Development Bank of Japan.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Floating power stations are believed to have less impact compared to fixed foundation stations
since there are less bird and wildlife species further out in the sea; but there’s no data to back it
up.


Five Hokkaido coastal areas designated potential offshore wind zones

(Government statement, May 12)
•  METI approved five Hokkaido coastal areas as potential offshore wind zones. Talks with
stakeholders will cover “Offshore Wind Promotion Zones” and project tenders.
•  The five areas are the coasts in Ishikari City, Ganwu-Minami Shiribeshi, Shimasaki, Hiyama and

of the Japan Sea coast in Aomori Pref, the south side of the Japan Sea coast in Aomori, Yuza
Township in Yamagata Pref, Kujukuri in Chiba Pref, and Isumi City in Chiba.



Chile aims for hydrogen superpower status, Japanese companies involved
(Nikkei, May 10)
•  Diego Pardow, the Minister of Energy for Chile, said he’s in talks with several Japanese companies
to finalize investment plans in the hydrogen sector.
•  Chile’s goal is to make hydrogen exports a major industry, with plans to become one of the world's

leading green hydrogen exporters by 2040. Japanese companies, including Sumitomo and
Idemitsu Kosan, entered Chile in early 2023.
•  CONTEXT: Chile boasts areas suitable for generating solar and wind power, and intends to
establish large-scale hydrogen plants in various regions to export to Japan and the EU.
Additionally, the country aims to mass-produce both green ammonia and green hydrogen.

Seoul and Tokyo can cooperate on LNG: South Korea finance minister

(Nikkei Asia, May 4)
•  Choo Kyung-ho, South Korea’s deputy PM and Minister of Economy and Finance, spoke about
possible cooperation with Japan on LNG.
•  He said that given both countries’ high dependency on LNG and their geographical proximity,
cooperation should be natural.
•  According to the minister, the two countries should cooperate through price negotiation, joint
purchases and exchanges when facing unstable supply and demand.
•  CONTEXT: For years, historical issues have strained relations between Japan and South Korea. In

March, a summit resulted in improved economic and security ties. South Korean leader Yoon Suk
Yeol's proposal to address historical issues played a role in improving relations. Both countries are
U.S. allies and are urged to cooperate to confront the challenges presented by China and North
Korea.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is the world’s biggest importer of LNG and until the recent rise of demand in China, South
Korea was the world’s second largest buyer. Should this evolve into more than political statements, it could

give the two countries some more clout in negotiations with LNG sellers. Perhaps the greatest benefit of
cooperation between the two, however, would be if they had flexibility to swap cargos to better balance each
other’s demand and supply.



Mitsubishi Materials, Capstone to test cobalt extraction technologies in Chile
(Japan NRG, May 10)
•  Mitsubishi Materials and Canada’s Capstone will develop new processes to extract cobalt from
waste generated at the Mantoverde copper mine in Chile. It’s owned 30% by Mitsubishi Materials
and 70% by Capstone.
•  Mitsubishi Materials said field tests of its proprietary leaching technologies will start before March

2024, and if positive then cobalt production starts around 4 years later.
•  Mantoverde reserves contain around 1,512/grams of cobalt in one ton of ore and 14 other
minerals. Presently the mine focuses on copper production.
•  CONTEXT: Capstone’s goal is to develop cost-efficient cobalt production processes, with new
technologies and expanding mine scalability. It plans to bring onstream the Santa Domingo mine
close to Mantoverde and integrate the two. Mitsubishi Materials has no stake in Santa Domingo.
• TAKEAWAY: Mitsubishi Materials faces complicated negotiations with Capstone on the licensing of the tech

developed separately and sharing the mine facilities and production.
Pressures to reduce cobalt refining costs are mounting globally as untapped reserves containing over 2,000
grams of cobalt per ton of ore have been discovered in Africa.

Japan Electricity Trading Market Renewal Scheduled After 2028

Electricity always requires perfect balance. Maintaining this equilibrium between what power
plants can deliver to the grid and what users require is, however, a tough task that’s only
getting harder.
Two years ago, Japan’s energy officials thought that they had mostly fixed the issue by
unveiling a new electricity trading platform specifically designed to keep disparate forces at
bay. The aptly named Balancing Market was supposed to do just that: patch up short-term
discrepancies in weather, generator performance, and consumer demand. But the result can
be best described as imperfect.

What Japan’s policy specialists discovered is that while the end product – electricity – was
always the same and priced equally, how and when this energy was produced, and the efforts
to do so, had a huge impact on its availability. And, hence, on the overall balance of the
system.
Now, officials are hoping that a new, more complex market platform will better mirror the
realities of what it takes to provide electricity at competitive prices, while also ensuring that
there is sufficient capacity to meet future demand. The platform is partly based on the PJM
system in the U.S., and while it won’t launch for another five years, the main tenants are
already known.

What is the PJM system?
PJM is the largest competitive power market in the world, serving 65 million people in the U.S.
The system operates a competitive wholesale electricity market that enables generators to sell
electricity to retail electricity suppliers, which in turn sell electricity to end-use customers.

The PJM market is a two-settlement system, which means that power suppliers must first
submit their offers for energy, capacity, and ancillary services into the Day-Ahead Market,
which clears one day in advance of actual delivery. Then, in real-time, suppliers can submit
additional offers or modify existing offers based on changing market conditions, and the PJM
Balancing Authority dispatches generators to meet real-time demand.
The PJM market has several components, including the Day-Ahead Energy Market, which
schedules generation resources to meet forecasted energy requirements for the next day; the
Real-Time Energy Market, which accounts for real-time deviations from the Day-Ahead Energy
Schedule; and the Capacity Market, which ensures that PJM has sufficient resources to meet
the future peak load requirements.
In addition to these markets, PJM also has an Ancillary Services Market, which provides for the
procurement of ancillary services such as regulation and frequency response, and a Financial
Transmission Rights Market, which enables market participants to hedge against the risks
associated with transmission congestion.

What is Japan’s current system?
Before Japan fully liberalized its electricity market in 2016, then regional monopolies (now
better known as EPCOs) were fully integrated power utilities. That means, they were
responsible for the generation, transmission, distribution, and retail of electricity in their
respective regions.
Japan’s power balancing system was largely based on dispatchable thermal power and
pumped storage hydro power plants, all of which the EPCOs controlled. Even the power plants

18


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

that EPCOs did not own, such as in-house power generators at factories, were strictly
monitored by the energy companies. If a factory failed to fully consume the electricity it
produced in-house and sent the surplus to the grid, it was fined.
As a result, keeping the balance of power demand and supply was relatively straightforward.
Staff at a load dispatch center could manage the balance without modern software tools and
systems. In addition, there was little intermittent power generation from solar or wind to
consider at that time.

Once the market was fully opened to competition in 2016, and with the ongoing boom in solar
and other renewables, the number of factors impacting on the daily balance of electricity in
the grid rose. METI tried to keep pace with the changes by introducing a number of market
mechanisms.
Over the last three to four years, the number of these mechanisms has grown substantially.
Many are also subdivided by regions and other factors.


Electricity volume (kWh)
•  Day-Ahead Market (Spot Market): Electricity is traded for each of the 30-minute slots
in the next 24 hours of the following day. Managed by JEPX.
•  Intraday Market: Opens at 5pm on the previous day and trades electricity until one
hour before the real-time delivery of electricity.
•  Forward Market: Contracts for virtual or physical delivery of electricity are bought for
delivery as soon as in three days, or as far back as three years.
•  Baseload Market: Trade electricity volumes for the following year.

Electricity capacity (kW)
•  Capacity Market: Auction-based system that allows buyers to book capacity four
years from now. Started in FY2020 and managed by OCCTO.
•  Long-Term Decarbonized Power Resource Auction: starting this year, this sub-section
of the capacity market will target capacity that reduces the energy system’s
emissions, and may allow booking for up to 20 years.

Electricity availability (delta kW)
•  Balancing Market: Introduced two years ago to relieve the EPCOs of performing the
(expensive) role of balancing the overall electricity system. This task now falls to
transmission and distribution (T&D) firms, which use the platform to secure the
power they need to balance their local system.

Problems with the current system
In theory, the various platforms cover all the angles. The Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX)
collects information on expected demand and supply for the next 24-hours. Power generators
(EPCOs and new market players) then adjust their supply/demand and submit offers for the
next day’s market. Should circumstances change just before the deadline for such submissions,
known as “Gate Close”, operators can turn to the Intraday Market for fine-tuning.

In reality, there are a number of imperfections in the balancing system.
1) The Day-Ahead Market is based on a single-price auction (all contracts for each 30-
minute slot for the next 24h are traded at the same price), but the Intraday Market is
based on a Merit Order auction (contracts executed based on the cheapest bid). This
means power plants used to balance the system are priced differently in the two
markets.
2) The balancing power sources are traded in two different units, namely kilowatt-hour
(kWh) (real power supply at a specific time) in the spot and the Intraday markets, but
they are sold as kilowatts (kWs) (the right to use power generation capacity at a specific
time) on the Reserve Exchange. This leads to inefficiency in allocations.
3) The time and cost needed to start up reserve power sources widely differ, but this is not
presently reflected in the price. For example, gas-fired power plants are able to start
supplying electricity within 18 or so hours. Coal plants need more than a day, while
nuclear plant operations are planned months in advance.
4) Japan relies on pumped storage hydro plants for energy storage and to regulate
electricity frequencies. However, EPCOs need one week for preparation, so that they can
most effectively pump water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. Prior to
2011, EPCOs used night-time electricity volumes from nuclear plants to move the water
higher at a low cost. But the current shutdown of many of the reactors means operating
costs of pumped storage to cover peak times are significant.

New system
In response to these issues METI plans to merge
several components of the current power balancing
setup. The ministry wants to combine Electricity
Volumes (i.e., the kWh based Spot and Intraday
markets), with Electricity Availability (i.e., the delta
kW market on the Power Reserve Exchange. In
other words, this will take into account the cost of
maintaining a power plant that’s ready to go as
needed; the cost of starting it up; and the
incremental cost of running it.
In practice, this means bids will need to reflect all of
the above aspects on an integrated market
platform. So, the bidding will be based on what
METI calls “three-part cost-based offers”. The
combination would take into account short-term needs and the situation in a week’s time, and
match that with the awareness of the time and cost required to bring additional capacity
online.
While this sounds even more complicated than the current system, the caveat is that a very
similar set-up already exists and works well elsewhere. METI’s new system took inspiration
from the PJM Interconnection, which is a regional transmission organization (RTO) that
coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in 13 U.S. states and the District of
Columbia.
Such a system is better able to differentiate and value the power sources in terms of their
characteristics. A power plant that’s quick to go online can get paid for its flexibility or lose out
to alternatives that best match the demand picture.

Once Japan completes the renewal of load-dispatch centers at T&D companies, probably after
FY2028, the new power market is supposed to come into effect.
The change could be monumental, not only because it’s likely to bring more efficiency to the
nation’s electricity markets, but also because it should create a fairer industry landscape.

The system will allow power sources to be priced by their characteristics, including how
quickly they can respond to changes in demand or weather, and how economically they do so.
Amid endless debates about which energy sources are “best”, this could settle at least one of
the arguments.

ANALYSIS

BY MATSUMOTO TAKEHIRO

Going into this week’s G7 summit Japan is on the defensive

When Japan hosts the Group of Seven this weekend in Hiroshima, Prime Minister Kishida will
be keen to project a positive image of the country’s energy agenda. His headline Green
Transformation (GX) policy will no doubt be touted as a pragmatic solution attuned to the
realities of developing Asia and Japan. Some of his G7 peers, however, may be less sanguine.
Energy won’t be the only topic discussed in Hiroshima, which is Kishida’s home constituency,
but it will be the one area that connects the key challenges facing the G7 today: international
security, climate action, and the cost of living crisis (inflation, global economic inequality, etc.)

Given the central role of energy, the G7 leaders will be keen to show a united front. Tensions
with China and Russia almost demand it. However, the gaps between allies on energy strategy
are also obvious. The roles of nuclear and natural gas, the timing for a phaseout of coal, the
weight of reliance on renewables, the faith in EVs, and the interpretation of “transition” in
financing are among potential flashpoints.
In the eyes of many international media and environmental groups, Japan is the laggard that
needs to upgrade its views. Coverage of the G7 Energy Ministers' meeting in Sapporo on April
15-16 largely painted Japan as a holdout against a cleaner world. But Kishida won’t be relying
on diplomacy and mild manners alone to keep the peace while defending Japan’s position.

The prime minister has invited strong voices from outside the G7 to join the Summit. These
will likely challenge what it means to be “ambitious” in energy and climate discussions.

Political background
In the last two decades, with the notable exceptions of the late Abe Shinzo and Junichiro
Koizumi, Japanese prime ministers have lasted in office only about a year. Kishida also looked
to be on his way out last fall with plummeting ratings, but six months on his approval rate has
rebounded strongly. The G7 is seen as a crowning moment for a PM who’s spent much of his
20 months in office focused on foreign policy.
It’s now expected that Kishida will call for a snap election soon after the G7 summit, possibly in
June. The summit will be a test of his ability to balance divergent views between Japan and its
Western allies on climate and energy issues, as well as a way to build smoother relations
between the developed and developing worlds.

Should Kishida prevail and lead his party to victory in a general election, his GX policy will be
cemented in the national strategy.

April meeting sets the tone
The Sapporo meeting is an indicator how the Hiroshima summit might unfold on May 19-
21. The meeting highlighted the urgency to cut global GHGs by an eye-popping 60% by 2035
compared with 2019 levels, in line with the latest IPCC report released in March.
The G7 ministers, however, failed to discuss in what form and to what extent China should
take responsibility. China accounts for one third of global GHGs and isn’t a member of the G7.
Neither is India, the world’s No. 3 emitter of GHGs.


China and India, however, are part of the broader G20, which the latter also hosts this year. As
such, Kishida has made a point of inviting India among eight non-member countries to the G7
summit. These include the United Arab Emirates, which will host the COP28 climate
conference later this year, as well as Indonesia, the current chair of ASEAN, and also Brazil.
Indonesia and Brazil are in the Top 10 countries by GHG emissions, according to the World
Resource Institute, which counts the EU as a single entity in its rankings.

The presence of G20 members and others from outside the G7 in Hiroshima will likely make it
more difficult for the summit to commit to new emission-cutting targets without locking in
more financial commitments to achieve this, especially as regards aid for developing
economies.

Coal and gas
The G7 climate ministers agreed last month to “accelerate the phase-out of unabated fossil
fuels so as to achieve net zero in energy systems by 2050” in general, including LNG. Adding
LNG to this conversation, which was previously focused on coal, was seen as a victory for the
European members of the G7.

Still, from Japan’s viewpoint, this was not really a loss. Abating fossil fuels means installing
carbon capture technology, which Japan has supported for many years and where many of its
engineering firms claim to have a competitive advantage. While locations for storing CO2
inside Japan are yet to be decided, there are multiple projects exploring the creation of such
storage hubs with partners in South East Asia, as well as in North America and Australia. A
number of pilot projects are also testing the idea of recycling carbon.
For Japan, the question lies more on timing. Abating thermal generation remains an expensive
and still partly experimental task. No two projects are the same. And until carbon capture,
utilization and storage (CCUS) can be declared as fully commercialized, Japan and its allies will
likely remain cautious in putting a definitive date on an exit from coal.
In this context, adding natural gas to the “abated” rule was also not as significant for Japan
and some other G7 members as the tacit approval by the group’s ministers for further
investment in upstream natural gas. While acknowledging the need to end dependence on
natural gas, the climate ministers’ communiqué said that investment “can be appropriate” to
the extent that it accords with GHG reduction targets.

Hydrogen and ammonia
Hydrogen seems to get almost universal approval, but Japan’s suggestion that ammonia (a
hydrogen carrier) should also be used for power generation is starting to face strong pushback
from some G7 partners.
Japan’s logic is that ammonia does not release CO2 when burned and can be used as a
substitute at coal power plants. Initially, the gas would be burned alongside coal, with the
former’s ratio gradually rising until it takes over completely.

In the last six months, however, that vision has come under strong criticism from
environmental groups inside and outside Japan. According to calculations by entities including
23


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

BNEF, burning ammonia as well as coal is not cost-efficient and could allow coal to be used for
many years to come. The drop in CO2 emissions from switching to ammonia is also questioned
since nearly all of it today is made from fossil fuels. Manufacturing the gas with the help of
renewables is expensive.

U.S. climate envoy John Kerry even expressed concerns that hydrogen / ammonia co-firing
(with coal) would lead to a “postponement” of the energy transition.

Most G7 ministers expressed a desire for hydrogen and ammonia to be reserved for industrial
and transport use. Japan’s GX strategy, however, sees power generation as the catalyst for
greater use of hydrogen / ammonia.

EVs
Perhaps the most sensitive issue from Japan’s viewpoint is how the G7 views the future of
transport. The expansion of electric vehicle (EV) sales in European countries, as well as in the
U.S., has led those G7 members to push for concrete targets in the sector. Most accept that
clean vehicles (termed Zero Emission Vehicles, or ZEVs) could also include those that run on
some form of hydrogen as well as on batteries. For Japan, this is not an ideal solution.
The U.K. wants the G7 to demand that all new vehicles sold in major markets be ZEVs by 2035,
while the U.S. proposes a 50% share of ZEV sales in the next 10 years, synchronized with its
respective industrial policy at home.

So far, however, G7 ministers only agreed to “note the opportunity to collectively reduce by at
least 50% the CO2 emissions from the G7’s vehicle stock by 2035 or earlier relative to the level
in 2000 as a halfway point to achieving net zero….”

The ministers also agreed to track progress on an annual basis. In doing so, Japan believes that
there is room to insert another clean-transport pathway via biofuels and synthetic fuels. This is
why the use of the term ZEV is preferable to the one previously used: BEV (battery electric
vehicles).
Japan has announced a policy that new car sales will be limited to EVs by 2035, but the
country’s highly influential auto industry is also keen to develop synthetic or e-fuels, noting
that blending regular gasoline with cleaner fuels would cut emissions of the cars already on
the road (and hence total emissions) faster than waiting for everyone to switch to electric cars.

Furthermore, Japan has expressed concern about the availability of the raw materials needed
to make EV batteries. China controls the majority of the market for such materials or their
processing.
Fukushima cleanup
Japan is also keen for the G7 to support its agenda to clean up the wrecked Fukushima nuclear
plant. This includes releasing water, which has been treated to remove radiation, into the
ocean over a period of time.

The plan has so far received the blessing of the IAEA, but not everyone is convinced. German
Environment Minister Steffi Lemke, for example, said the release of treated water is not
welcomed.
A green light from the G7 for the Fukushima cleanup plan would help Kishida win further
domestic approval for such actions. But this remains a sensitive subject.


Carbon pricing
One area where the G7 may see the biggest consensus is that of carbon credits and / or
pricing. The April climate ministers’ meeting already spelled out that Japan will establish a
24


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

secretariat for the “Article 6 Partnership,” a scheme to trade emission reductions among
nations, indicating that preparations are now in place for the creation of an international
carbon trading market.
This is seen as a useful mechanism to transfer funding from wealthier nations to developing
economies by financing emission reduction projects. In effect, it also helps to transfer clean
energy tech to the Global South while allowing developed economies to claim some of the
benefit against their own CO2 numbers.

Ever since the 2000s, UN climate summits and similar events have been hampered by tensions
between the developed and developing economies, with the latter claiming that any climate
“ambitions” should be matched by real financial assistance. The $100 billion per year promised
to developing countries in 2009 has never materialized.
If Kishida is able to persuade his guests from the G7 and the G20 that carbon credits are a way
to bridge those differences and allocate funding to match the ambitions, he will achieve a
major coup and real progress in climate action. In that case, the other rifts will become a lot
easier to gloss over.

GLOBAL      VIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Solar power
The govt earmarked AU$4 billion for new investments in the energy transition, with focus on
lowering energy costs and supply reliability. AU$1.3 billion will go to household energy
upgrades, of which AU$1 billion will provide low-cost loans for solar modules.
Brazil/ Natural gas
Equinor and partners will invest $9 billion to develop a gas discovery off the coast; it’s
estimated to hold more than 1 billion barrels of recoverable oil equivalent. Gas from the
project could represent 15% of Brazil’s total gas demand when it starts in 2028.

China/ Peak emissions
China’s carbon emissions will hit a new record in 2023, but a rapid expansion in green energy
will soon enable peak emissions. China, the world’s largest emitter of GHGs, saw CO2
emissions rise 4% in Q1 YoY, reaching more than 3 billion tons, according to the Centre for
Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).
France/ ESG
BNP Paribas will no longer finance new gasfield projects, as it faces lawsuits for supporting the
sector. But climate activists say that most of the bank’s support for oil and gas is through
corporate loans and bond underwriting, not direct loans.

Germany/ Batteries
Northvolt, Europe’s main battery maker, will go ahead with plans for a factory after the govt
agreed to hundreds of millions of euros in subsidies. Northvolt had earlier indicated it might
suspend its plans for the factory and concentrate solely on North America unless the EU
matched generous U.S. subsidies.
Indonesia/ Cobalt mining
The country is now the world’s second-largest supplier of cobalt, contributing to a sharp fall in
the price of the battery metal. Indonesia generated 9,500 tons of cobalt in 2022 — 5% of the
global supply; this is up from very small volumes in 2020, said the Cobalt Institute.
Turkey/ Natural gas
Turkey has deferred to 2024 payment to Russia of a $600 million natural gas bill, the first such
postponement under a new deal. As much as $4 billion in Turkey’s energy payments to Russia
may be postponed until next year.

UK/ Battery management tech
Abu Dhabi-based renewables developer Masdar agreed to use Octopus Energy's technology
platform Kraken to manage battery systems. In October, Masdar committed to invest £1
billion in UK battery storage, following its acquisition of London-based Arlington Energy.
U.S./ Coal power plants
Joe Biden unveiled a plan to impose GHG limits on power plants. Existing coal plants will have
to install CCS technology starting in 2030, while those shutting between 2035 and 2040 will
have to co-fire with 40% natural gas by 2030. By 2050, the capacity of coal-fired power plants
in the U.S. should decline by more than half from 2022 levels.

U.S./ Oil

Berkshire Hathaway won't take full control of Occidental Petroleum, where it has a 20% stake,
Warren Buffett said at its annual shareholder meeting. Last year, Berkshire received regulatory
approval to purchase as much as a 50% stake in the oil and gas company.
Venezuela/ Oil exports
Chevron will boost oil production in Venezuela to recover $3 billion of debt by late 2025. So
far, Chevron recovered $220 million. In November, The U.S. issued a 6-month, automatically
renewing license for Chevron to resume Venezuelan crude exports to the U.S.
