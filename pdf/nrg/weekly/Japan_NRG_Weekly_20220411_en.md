OPINION: Deregulation to blame for electricity shortages
(Shukan Diamond, April 16 edition)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by the Shukan Diamond editorial team.
•  While recent power cuts around Japan were triggered by an earthquake off the Fukushima coast, a

chronic shortage of generation capacity means that it might not even take a natural disaster to
cause power outages.
•  The electricity sector reform in 2012 is to blame for the chronic capacity shortage.
•  Electricity generation and transmission deregulation, and transition to a profit-based model, made
legacy power plant operators less financially secure, forcing them to shut oil-fired plants and other
aging and little-utilized plants.
•  In the five years since 2016, over a gigawatt of capacity—equivalent to the output of one nuclear

power station—has been removed from the grid.
•  A quick fix to this problem is restarting some of Japan’s idle nuclear reactors. Four nuclear power
stations have been approved for restart by their local communities.
•  Such a move would free up a total of 4.6 GW of additional capacity.

WAR IN UKRAINE:
Japan will phase out Russian coal imports in latest round of sanctions
(Nikkei Shimbun, April 8)
•  PM Kishida announced that Japan will phase out coal imports from Russia in response to the

latter’s invasion of Ukraine and reported war crimes.
•  The coal ban is part of a broader import restriction against Russian products, which will include
Russian wood, machinery, and even vodka.
•  The schedule for the phaseout is not yet clear, with PM Kishida saying that it will be done in
consultation with the power generation, cement and steelmaking sectors, which will need to find
alternatives.
•  In order to avoid problems with coal supply for power generation, Kishida said: "we will make

maximum use of renewables, nuclear, and other power sources that are highly effective for energy
security and decarbonization.”
•  The latest sanctions also ban new investments in Russia.
•  Several power utilities in Japan said they will stop new spot or long-term contract purchases of coal
from Russia.
• TAKEAWAY: PM Kishida continues to act quickly and largely in lockstep with Western allies in the G7. Russian

coal accounts for only about 13% of Japan’s supply (but as much as a third in the thermal coal segment). It
won’t be simple to replace these volumes because today’s market is very tight, coal prices are the highest in
decades, and buyers tend to require particular grades of coal for their specific needs. Some goal grades are
only suitable for power generation, for example, and power facilities also tend to be “tuned” to operation on
coal that has specific characteristics in terms of energy, ash, moisture and other content. That means we’re
unlikely to see all Russian coal supplies vanish from Japanese ports for four to six months.

• In the meantime, Japan’s coal supplies will be at risk, despite the country’s ample stockpiles. Should Russia’s
government decide to disrupt coal exports to Japan in retaliation for the embargo, problems will compound in
the domestic and broader Asian markets. At the very least, we can expect continued increase in coal prices,
and as a result further increase in electricity prices.

• For some, the key comment from PM Kishida related to nuclear power. Yet as discussed previously, Japan’s
central government does not have direct control over reactor restarts and there’s not yet enough evidence to
suggest a pick-up in the pace of restarts.



Japanese buyers stick to Russian gas, but cast eye for alternatives

(Yomiuri Shimbun and Financial Times, Apr 8-10)
•  Tokyo Gas CEO Uchida Takashi said that his company intends to continue to source LNG from the
Sakhalin 2 project in Russia.
•  Uchida said any interruption in gas imports will jeopardize residential gas supply.
•  Gas from the Sakhalin 2 project makes up around 8% of Japan’s total LNG imports.

•  Hiroshima Gas relies on Sakhalin 2 for half its long-term contract volumes, but it may ask Malaysian
suppliers to increase volumes or deliver ahead of schedule in case of problems with Russia.
•  Osaka Gas said it will ask for earlier deliveries from Australia and U.S. producers in case of
disruptions to Russian supply.
• TAKEAWAY: Today’s global LNG market is like a zero-sum game. If Japan is pressured by Western allies to

reject Russian supplies, it will need to secure similar volumes from elsewhere. At a time when the EU and the
UK, among others, are seeking alternative suppliers to Russia, this simply adds more eager bidders for the
same available LNG volumes. At some point, demands for a complete exodus from Russian natural gas will
need to be seen in this context.

• It’s also questionable how much Japan’s energy buyers can request earlier deliveries from non-Russian sources.
Without a long-term storage facility, balancing the timing of deliveries is hard.
• Global LNG market shortages are expected if Russian LNG volumes do not enter the market somewhere (for

example: China or India, which could free up some of the volumes those buyers would have procured
elsewhere).
• We expect curtailment of industrial output to conserve gas to become an increasingly regular topic, if not a
reality, going forward this year.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
Hydrogen’s Day of Reckoning Is Approaching in Japan;
Which Technologies Will Win Out?

The next two years will make or break the fate of hydrogen in Japan, at least as far as
the state-led hydrogen economy program plans to meet its 2030 targets.

The goal is for hydrogen-fired power generation to have a nominal but noticeable
place in the national electricity mix, at 1% of the total by 2030. Instead of building
new power capacity oriented on hydrogen, most of that 1%, which is equivalent to 9-
10 TWh of electricity, will come from so-called co-firing. This assumes that some gas
power plants will add hydrogen into their fuel mix and some coal plants will do the
same with its cousin, ammonia.

The challenges were, and remain, picking the most reliable, cost-effective, and
environmentally clean technology. Booming interest in the hydrogen economy has
revealed a plethora of technological solutions for both H2 and ammonia.

After years of testing and R&D, it’s decision time. Supply chains from production to
transport and storage to consumption must be up and running well before 2030 for
Japan to hit that 1% target. Here, we review some of Japan’s current solutions in
hydrogen and ammonia.


Imports and domestic sources
Japan’s hydrogen economy program calls for the fuel, or ammonia, to account for 1%
of national power generation and be used in manufacturing processes by replacing
fossil fuels. The assumption is that hydrogen production costs will drop to ¥30/ Nm3
by 2030, from the current ¥170/Nm3 for hydrogen, and to ¥15-20/ Nm3 from ¥25-
30/Nm3 for ammonia.

Most of Japan’s ammonia and hydrogen demand is expected to be met with overseas
supply. While the government expects to initially use blue hydrogen that’s made from
natural gas, after 2030 the outlook is for green hydrogen (made with renewables) to
become more popular.

With few low-cost renewable energy facilities, Japan doesn't expect to become a
significant producer of green hydrogen. Since the hydrogen will originate from natural
gas and be utilized by gas-firing power plants for co-firing, Japan plans to lean on its
fossil fuel infrastructure.

According to oil refining major ENEOS, by 2030 Japan will require 300,000 tons of
hydrogen for gas power plants’ co-firing. ENEOS will convert its refineries into
hydrogen supply bases. The company’s desulfurization units could be used for
dehydrogenation (turning hydrogen from liquid to gas); its port terminals, piers,
pipelines and storage tanks can offload and store H2.

Crucially, seven ENEOS refineries are located on the Pacific coast, close to half of
Japan’s gas-fired power plants. ENEOS has 12 crude oil tankers and 15 chemical
tankers that can be adapted to carry hydrogen. The company favors MCH technology

16

for transport, which it believes it can secure in large quantities from Saudi Arabia,
Australia and Southeast Asia.

MCH (Methylcyclohexane), already a widely used compound, can also be produced
when converting hydrogen into a liquid using an element called toluene. This turns
hydrogen into a compound that’s relatively easy to transport.


Liquid or compound?
Five years ago, most efforts focused on finding ways to transport H2 in liquid form.
Kawasaki Heavy Industries built the world’s first liquified hydrogen carriers, the Suiso
Frontier, which set sail in 2021. Japan’s largest hydrogen producer, Iwatani
Corporation, now uses the liquified form to transport locally produced hydrogen to
fuel cell vehicle service stations.

Cooling hydrogen to the point of liquefaction (-253°C) is energy intensive. Initially, it
was better because it had lower energy losses (25-35%) compared to MCH (35-40%).
But MCH’s advantage is that it’s condensed by 500-fold; so, one liter of MCH can
store 500 liters of hydrogen that can be transported at room temperature and
pressure, avoiding the cost of cooling pure hydrogen.

MCH is also safe due to limited chemical reactions regardless of ambient pressure or
temperature changes. Now, ENEOS says it found a way for MCH to make up the
energy losses by developing a green hydrogen process it calls Direct MCH.
















Source: ENEOS
At present, green MCH has two steps: water electrolysis powered by renewables to
separate hydrogen from water, and then toluene hydrogenation. Direct MCH allows
for a direct reaction of toluene with water instead of hydrogen, eliminating the need
to store hydrogen in tanks before the next toluene hydrogeneration phase. As a
result, the cost of MCH is halved.

The company believes the innovation will help achieve the ¥30/ Nm3 goal. It’s also
developing MW-class large electrolyzers by expanding the electrode area and
stacking cells. In 2021, ENEOS and Origin Energy conducted a trial run of Direct MCH
in Australia. Solar powered the electrolyzer, producing 4 liters of MCH, then shipped
to Japan to power a FC vehicle.

Breakthrough ammonia technologies
Japan’s ammonia demand is 1 million tons/ year, which might triple by 2030.
Ammonia is manufactured using the Haber-Bosche process. Japanese manufacturers
have to pay license fees to European firms for the process, so they’ve looked for an
alternative for years.

Recently, startup Tsubame BHB developed an electride catalyst that produces
ammonia at a lower temperature and pressure than Haber-Bosche. It can produce the
gas at 300-400°C and in a 3-5 MPa environment, compared to Haber-Bosch's 400-
500°C and a 20 MPa requirement.

So far, the catalyst has been used in smaller manufacturing plants with output of 500
to 50,000 ammonia tons/ year. Tsubame BHB has yet to find a way to apply the
process to bigger facilities. The new catalyst raises cost issues, however. It contains
platinum group metals that are expensive and not easy to secure, with Russia one of
the major global suppliers. The process also generates nitrates and nitrites, which are
toxic.














Graphic: Tsubame BHB
Another Japanese oil refinery major, Idemitsu, says it has a better solution — a
process that will employ molybdenum instead of PGMs. Idemitsu’s catalyst is
dinitrogen-bridged dimolybdenum, a combination of molybdenum dioxide and
nitrogen. The company manufactures compounds with a similar composition for its oil
products. Molybdenum is commonly found in copper ores and costs $20-30/ kg, a
clear price advantage against the $10/ gram for ruthenium, a PGM.

18

Challenges still remain. Idemitsu needs to improve the energy efficiency of its
ammonia production process and find a way to control the toxic substances
generated as a byproduct. The oil refiner hopes to complete development by 2024
and to have a cartridge-based system that allows the scaling up of output by 2028.
Tsubame BHB also hopes to develop a PGM-free version of its catalyst by 2024, and
aims to be ready for pilot tests by 2027.

Japanese academics have stepped up research on new non-PGM catalysts. New
possibilities include compounds composed of nickel, copper, manganese and others.
Main challenges are improving the endurance and life cycle of the compounds,
scaling up the process, as well as improving energy efficiency.

Build it and they will come
Despite all these advances and progress, industry insiders and experts are concerned
that all efforts to create abundant hydrogen and ammonia suppliers will fall flat if the
promised demand does not materialize. As one METI committee panel on the matter
noted, nearly all the R&D in the space is heavily weighted towards production. There’s
much less innovation among industries to actually deploy the hydrogen.

Consumers in the power sector, such as JERA, have committed to moving towards
hydrogen and ammonia in the mid-to-long-term, but are still guessing on timelines
and volumes. Much depends on the technical testing of co-firing, such as the one
JERA started at its Hekinan coal-fired power station last year.

If it goes well, JERA hopes to accelerate full commercialization of co-firing before a
self-imposed 2030 deadline. In fact, the power utility this February launched a global
tender for “up to” 500,000 tons of ammonia per year from FY2027. But ultimately,
JERA’s decision will depend on the cost of this ammonia, as well as the co-firing pilot
projects.

Despite the many uncertainties, the window of opportunity to hit the 2030 net-zero
targets is closing. In the next two years, Japan may simply need to take a leap of faith.

Renewables Operators May See Some Asset Values Jump
On Change in Grid Rules


In some of Japan’s local power grids, developing renewable energy facilities has
proved problematic with a lack of spare capacity often cited as the reason. To address
the issue, a few years ago a new kind of “non-firm” contract was rolled out. It allowed
new power assets to connect to the grid but limited their operations to times where
there was spare capacity in the transmission system.

As such, owners of “non-firm” contracts were the first in line to have their operations
curtailed in times of weak demand or oversupply.

Now, with the government looking to give renewables priority access to the grid,
bumping thermal and other CO2-emitting sources down the priority order, the group
of power facilities likely to benefit the most could be those with a “non-firm” contract.
Once owners of an arrangement that offered only a partial operating schedule,
developers and investors behind plants with a “non-firm” contract could now see
material upside in the value of their assets.

The change could also have a significant impact on coal and gas-fired power plants in
areas with a large volume of such contracts. The Tokyo power grid, in particular, may
see a strong shakeup in run rates among various power plants.

Fluctuation in firm capacity use and non-firm availability












How the system works today
With a big surge in interest from developers in building solar and wind power plants
over the last decade, local transmission system operators, or TSOs, have struggled
with how to accommodate the newcomers while reserving grid capacity for existing
suppliers.
When a generation asset is brought into operation, a grid connection request must be
addressed to the TSO in charge of the area. The TSO evaluates the grid connection
costs, which include checks that the capacity of the network allows the new power
source to be effectively transmitted and/or distributed, as well as the actual cost of
connecting the asset to the correct voltage branch of the grid.

| On Change in Grid Rules |

If there is not enough network capacity to accommodate the asset, two options are
available to the TSO. It might consider upgrading the grid, especially if several
generating assets were able to share the grid upgrade costs. Alternatively, it can offer
the developer a non-firm contract.
Assets under a non-firm transmission contract can send power through the grid only
when there is capacity left after other (firm contract) power sources have dispatched
their power. This means that when grid capacity is reached, non-firm assets will be
curtailed.

This system was originally applied to areas with a significant shortage of capacity,
including the Tokyo area from September 2019, and Tohoku and Kyushu from 2020.
From January 2021 it was deployed nationwide for the bulk power system of each
area and soon after that was extended across all three levels of the grid.
Such an un interruptible transmission system was created to increase the amount of
renewable assets connected to the grid. As much as 98% of the 855 connection
requests in FY2020 were for renewable assets, and the period from April 2021 to end-
September 2021 saw even more connection requests.

Instead of refusing the connection of some of these renewable assets, the TSOs
offered non-firm contracts. Out of the 1409 connection requests during this period,
497 non-firm contracts were offered - a nationwide average of 35%, with considerable
variation among regions.
In theory, such a system allows for the integration of more renewable power on the
grid, but the increased curtailment risk means a project may not getting funded or
commissioned.

Non-firm assets are also currently not allowed to participate in the capacity and
balancing markets, reducing monetization options.
Under the current rule, coal assets under a firm contract could keep producing power
during periods of grid congestion, while renewable assets under a non-firm contract
are curtailed.


Reforms of the rules
METI is now changing the system to support growth in green power sources. From
April 2022, only non-firm transmission contracts will be given to all forms of
generating assets connecting to the bulk power system nationwide, and this will be
extended to the local power system layer by the end of FY2022.
From December 2022 the curtailment order will be modified for non-firm assets as
well as for adjustable power assets. From FY2023 these rules should be extended to
all assets, including assets under firm-contract.

The new curtailment order will be as follows:
1. The first assets that will be curtailed will be thermal power plants that have been
appointed as priority curtailment assets by the TSOs, thermal power plants with online
curtailment control system, pumped hydro, and batteries
2. After that thermal power plants with no online controls will be curtailed
3. Followed by biomass power plants
4. Followed by PV and wind power plants
5. And finally other plants such as nuclear, hydropower and geothermal
Within each category, plants with the highest marginal cost of generation will be
curtailed first. This will have the added benefit of reducing the power wholesale

market price as the price is equal to the marginal cost of the most expensive asset
cleared for a given interval on the market.
In addition to the change in curtailment priority order, non-firm assets will be allowed
to participate in both the capacity market (from this year for delivery in 2026) and the
balancing market. METI plans to monitor and review the results of these changes in
FY2022 and FY2023.


Impact
These changes should have several effects. Renewable assets developed over the last
two years with non-firm contracts but not commissioned due to the associated risks
are likely to move forward.

In future, curtailment of renewable assets will be reduced considerably from where it
would have been under the old system - although as renewable penetration increases,
curtailment risk is still expected to increase compared to recent years, apart from in
the Kyushu area.
Finally, the economics of fossil fuel generation plants are going to be further
squeezed as curtailment increases. These assets will have to find new sources of
income, potentially through the balancing market.

For now, victory in the competition to grid access goes to renewable energy
operators. But there is one eventuality that has yet to be explained by the
government under the changing rules of the game. What will happen to fossil fuel
generation plant curtailment orders when, or if, METI’s vision of ammonia fuel and/or
carbon capture materializes?

If the premise for curtailment orders changes to include a plant’s environmental
criteria, as well as its marginal costs, we may see another shift in grid access hierarchy.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Asia/ Floating solar power
Asia is leading global growth in floating solar installations, said Fitch Solutions. There
are now 22 such projects, with expected total installed capacity of 10 GW, up 37.5%
from early 2021. Among the leading projects is China’s 320 MW Huaneng Power
International.

Colombia/ Renewables
Spanish solar developer Grenergy issued €52.5 million of green bonds to finance
renewables projects. In total, Grenergy plans to invest more than $700 million in
Colombia to develop a portfolio of 1 GW of renewable projects that are currently at
different stages of development.

Europe/ Solar power
The EU has the potential to add 39 GW of solar power under an “accelerated high
scenario” that in 2022 would add 23.3 GW of rooftop and 15.7 GW of utility-scale
solar, said SolarPower Europe. This accelerated scenario could see global solar
capacity reach 1 TW by 2030.

Germany/ Gas storage
Berlin nationalized Gazprom Germania, the local subsidiary of the Russian gas group
that operates some of Germany’s largest natural gas storage facilities. The
government cited the company’s alleged “unclear legal relationship and its violations
of its reporting obligations”.
Global solar and wind power
Wind and solar generated 10.3% of global electricity in 2021, twice more than 2015,
said Ember Research. Denmark and Luxembourg led electricity generation from
renewables, at 52% and 43%, respectively. 50 countries now produce 10% of their
electricity from wind and solar, up from 43 in 2020.

LNG/ Infrastructure investments
Miami-based I Squared Capital closed its $15 billion infrastructure fund. The LNG
sector is said to be top on the fund’s priority list, as it hopes to capitalize on Europe’s
need for alternative gas supplies from Russia, as well as Asia’s growing appetite for
LNG.

Russia/ Coal exports
In March, several Chinese firms purchased Russian coal with yuan. The shipments will
arrive this month and are the first commodity shipments purchased in China's currency
since the war in Ukraine began. According to the Bank for International Settlements,
90% of foreign-exchange transactions in 2019 were in U.S. dollars, compared to just
over 4% for the yuan.

Sweden/ Carbon capture
The EU gave €180 million to Stockholm Exergi to build Europe’s first large-scale
negative carbon emissions plant. When completed, the bio-energy with carbon
capture and storage (BECCS) at the company’s KVV8 bio-cogeneration plant will have
an annual capture capacity of almost 800,000 tons of CO2.

Switzerland/ Carbon capture
Climeworks, the Swiss carbon capture startup, raised CHF 600 million. Financing was
led by Partners Group , GIC, and Swiss Re, with participation from Baillie Gifford,
Carbon Removal Partners, Global Founders Capital, and Climeworks’ anchor
shareholder, BigPoint Holding.

Taiwan/ Renewables
The government and state-controlled companies will invest $32 billion through 2030
to develop renewable technologies, grid infrastructure and energy storage. The
country plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. By 2026, it has a goal to produce
20% of power from renewables.

U.S./ Energy transition
NextEra Energy sold its 156-mile natural gas pipeline in Texas for about $200 million,
and will invest the transaction proceeds “to acquire higher-yielding renewable
assets,” said NextEra CEO John Ketchum.

Zimbabwe/ Coal power
RioZim Ltd, one of the country’s biggest mining and energy companies, had planned
to work with China to build a major coal-fired power plant. Beijing, however, pulled
out because it’s scaling back overseas funding, forcing nations in Africa and Asia to
rethink energy plans.
