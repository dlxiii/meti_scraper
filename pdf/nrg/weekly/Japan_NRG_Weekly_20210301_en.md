Japanese startup to roll out first typhoon-proof wind power turbines this year
(Asia Nikkei, Feb. 22)

o  Japanese startup Challenergy plans to produce its first stormproof wind power turbines
this year and believes it can sell as many as 100 units next year.
o  The Magnus VAWT, or Vertical Axis Wind Turbine model, uses rotating vertical cylinders
that are more stable and can work even when wind speeds reach 40 meters per second.
That is almost twice the design specs for a regular turbine.
o  The company is targeting island nations with frequent storms, such as the Philippines,
where the first 10 kW unit will be installed. Th turbines will be sold together with a

storage battery to compensate for lower and costlier power output.
o  Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Venture Capital and Dai-Ichi Life Insurance are among the
investors in Challenergy.




Itochu partners with Air Liquide to build one of the world’s largest hydrogen plants
(Nikkei, Feb. 25)
•  Itochu, a Japanese trading house, will work with Air Liquide of France to build a liquid hydrogen
plant in central Japan. The facility will use natural gas as feedstock and, when completed in mid-
2020s, will be among the world’s largest.
•  The partners plan to produce 30 tons of liquid hydrogen a day and target power generation

facilities and fuel-cell vehicles as buyers.

Konica Minolta leads Japan manufacturers in decarbonization model
(Shukan Diamond, Feb. 20)
•  With global companies such as Google and Amazon demanding their suppliers go green, a

commitment to decarbonization is now a prerequisite for doing business in Japan.
•  Konica Minolta, the first Japanese manufacturer to commit to cutting carbon emissions, says
businesses should treat green policies not as a cost but as an opportunity to make money.
•  Minolta’s strategy differs from other Japanese manufacturers in that the corporation demands
suppliers to cut carbon emissions to help Minolta achieve decarbonization goals.
•  Konica Minolta also provides technical assistance and expertise to suppliers in China and Malaysia
to help them reduce carbon emissions while also reducing procurement costs.




Gas/renewables mix will provide ample power at low cost, Renewable Energy Institute says
(Gas Energy News, Feb. 22)
•  The Renewable Energy Institute released findings suggesting that limiting Japan’s energy sources

by 2030 to natural gas and renewables won’t create any economic or supply issues.
•  The report claims that after emissions costs are factored in, limiting energy sources in this way will
actually reduce Japan’s total energy cost to ¥11.1 trillion in 2030, which compares favorably with
the ¥12.7 trillion spent in 2019/20.
•  The report called for the use of coal-fired power stations to be limited to Hokkaido and Okinawa,
which face supply issues.
•  The findings are based on simulations of major power plant shutdowns and other emergencies.

•  The report cites an analysis of electricity supply and demand in all regions at all times of the day.



Could JOGMEC’s cobalt find make Japan a rare metals superpower?

(Emira, Feb. 24)
•  In July, JOGMEG announced that they had successfully extracted minerals from areas of cobalt-
rich crust that lie within Japan’s exclusive economic zone, in a world first.
•  The crust, only a few centimeters thick, tops undersea mountains that are located at depths of
1,000 to 2,500 meters below sea level.
•  The achievement has the possibility to turn Japan into a rare metals superpower in the next 10 to
20 years.
•  Demand for lithium-ion batteries has seen global demand for cobalt double in recent years.




MUFG establishes ¥100 bn fund to invest in renewable electricity

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 25)
•  As the first stage in an initiative to power its offices and branches exclusively with renewable
electricity, the Mitsubishi UFJ Group established a green investment fund that will invest around
¥100 billion in renewables.

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The fund will initially concentrate on procurement of electricity from FIT-approved solar farms, and
later broaden focus to include virtual power plants and hydrogen generation.
•  MUFG expects the initiative to reduce its CO2 emissions by 20,000 tons.
•  The bank’s offices and branches consume around 400 GWh per year. Assuming a renewable

electricity procurement cost of ¥12- ¥13 per kWh, it will cost ¥100 billion to procure the bank’s
electricity requirements over the next 20 years.



Kansai Electric to deliver power to less developed African regions

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 26)
•  Kansai Electric is collaborating with Tokyo-based SucreCube Japon to trial a service to bring
electricity and communications services to parts of Africa that currently lack these services.
•  The one-month trial will take place in March.
•  Under a memorandum signed with Senegal’s Ministry of Health and Social Action in 2019,
SucreCube Japon deploys a product known as the “Tumiqui Smart Kit”, which combines solar
panels, storage batteries, and LED lighting with communications equipment, to regions of Senegal

that lack electricity and communications services.



Kansai Electric, Keihan Bus and BYD to collaborate on electric bus initiative

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 26)
•  Kansai Electric, also known as KEPCO, Keihan Bus, and BYD Japan have agreed to collaborate on
an electric bus trial in Kyoto.
•  The first stage in the trial involves deploying four electric buses on the Kyoto-Station to Hotel
Emion Kyoto route. In a first for Japan, the route will be served solely by electric buses.
•  Subsequently, other routes will be added. In order to optimize bus operations, KEPCO will also
analyze data on bus movements and charging times.




Ammonia generation major opportunity for turbine manufacturers
(Shukan Economist, March 2)
•  JERA plans to blend an average of 20% ammonia with the thermal coal burned at its power

stations by the early 2030s.
•  JERA will trial an ammonia-coal blend at its Hekinan power plant in Aichi from 2021/22,
necessitating modifications to boilers, port facilities, storage tanks, and evaporation units.
Experiments with hydrogen blends are also planned.
•  The transition to ammonia will also create demand for new turbine technology. Since ammonia
releases polluting nitrogen oxides upon combustion, Mitsubishi Power is pursuing a strategy of
using waste heat to separate out ammonia’s hydrogen component and then using that hydrogen

to power dedicated turbines.

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Mitsubishi Power aims to leverage its hydrogen gas turbine technology to gain a bigger piece of
the ¥500 billion global gas turbine market, of which both Mitsubishi and GE currently control one
third each.
•  Sophisticated technology is required to build turbines that run on pure hydrogen because of the

risk of “flashback”. Mitsubishi has succeeded in producing a hydrogen turbine capable of
operating at 1,800 degrees with no risk of flashback.



Sumitomo Rubber to manufacture tires without CO2 by 2050, may use hydrogen

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 22)
•  Sumitomo Rubber Industries is aiming for virtually zero CO2 emissions in the tire manufacturing
process by 2050, and as part of that effort, it’s considering using hydrogen energy at its main tire
factories in Japan.
•  The Co. has joined the domestic hydrogen council to participate in solving problems around the
building of a hydrogen-based society.

(Nikkei, Feb. 24)
•  SG Holdings, which runs the Sagawa Express courier and delivery service, plans to move all of its
7,000 mini-cars to electric models by 2030, which should cut the company’s carbon footprint by

more than 10%.
•  This is the first such move by a Japanese delivery company.
•  The switch relates to the so-called kei cars - the smaller, narrow mini autos often used in Japan to
navigate in residential areas.
•  SG will use a new EV developed jointly with Japanese startup ASF. The prototype is due in spring.




Kawasaki Heavy forced to delay first hydrogen shipment due to Covid lockdown
(Various, Feb. 22)
•  Kawasaki Heavy’s plans to receive its first trial shipment of hydrogen from Australia this spring will
be delayed due to the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.
•  The Co. has manufactured the world’s first liquid hydrogen carrier, and carried out some test runs

last October. However, the ship needs to undergo a final registration process, which has been
delayed after overseas engineers were barred from visiting Japan as part of the recent lockdown in
the country.
•  The ship might not sail from Australia to Japan with the fuel until second half of this year.

TEPCO drops plans for near-term restart of Kashiwazaki nuclear plant
(Japan NRG, Feb 26)
•  The power utility operator said a recent inspection of Unit 7 at the Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP found
that work to fix a water leak issue hasn’t yet been resolved,
•  This made the company change the status of the unit restart to “undecided” from June.

•  CONTEXT: The utility had flagged its intention to load fuel into Unit 7 this spring ahead of a
restart.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO ignored broken seismographs for months
(Tokyo Shimbun, Feb. 22)
o  TEPCO said on Feb. 22 that because both of the seismographs installed in the unit three

reactor building at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were faulty, it was unable
to record seismological data from the Feb. 13 earthquake.
o  According to TEPCO, the seismographs stopped working last year due to rain damage
and other causes. A TEPCO representative apologized for the oversight.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Water leaking from Fukushima containment vessels

(NHK, Feb. 23)
o  On Feb. 22, TEPCO revealed since the Feb. 13 earthquake, water has been leaking from
the containment vessels enclosing Units 1 and 3 at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power
plant.
o  Nitrogen gas injected into the containment vessels to prevent explosion has also leaked
out, with the pressure within the vessels dropping from 1.2 kPa to slightly above
atmospheric pressure. The earthquake ’s force also caused the slight movement of tanks

erected on the site used to store radioactive water.
o  The Nuclear Regulation Authority, while saying the leaks do not pose a safety issue, has
called for TEPCO to step up its monitoring of the plant.

Liability claims against TEPCO from shareholder lawsuits climb to ¥22 trillion
(FACTA, March edition)
o  Lawsuits related to the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP accident have been ongoing for

almost 10 years, almost since the date of the accident itself. One of these is a lawsuit by
the company’s shareholders asking former TEPCO management to be responsible for
liabilities, and which has seen the compensation requested grow to ¥22 trillion.
o  TEPCO faces three kinds of court actions.
1) Shareholder lawsuits against the company filed at the Tokyo District Court
2) Class action suits by citizens from various areas of Japan who claim both the company
and the state are responsible for forced resident evacuations

3) Criminal suits against former TEPCO management, including ex-chairman Katsumata
o  In all cases, the main focus of the trial is whether the accident was avoidable and if
appropriate measures were in place. A lawyer experienced in such cases says all of these
suits will hinge on the Supreme Court and whether it rules that enough long-term
assessments highlighting the risks were available prior to the accident.
• TAKEAWAY: The recent scandals around an unauthorized personnel entry into the control room of the NPP is
just the latest in a number of small yet persistent mishaps around the company’s facilities. The fact it wasn’t

aware that seismographs at the Fukushima plant weren’t working until after this year’s quake on Feb. 13 can be
added to the list, which includes such basic errors as misreading radiation levels by a factor of 1,000. On the
eve of the 10-year Fukushima anniversary, it’s not clear how TEPCO can ever restore public faith, while the
liability claims against it keep climbing.

• In our view, TEPCO has less than a year to restart its Kashiwazaki NPP and show the government that it can
come back from nuclear exile. If it fails, we expect the company to lose its operable nuclear facilities in a state-
orchestrated restructuring.





Japan's top business lobby chief says nuclear is vital but needs a new vision
(Asia Nikkei, Feb. 24)
•  CONTEXT: The chairman of Keidanren, Japan’s top big business lobby group, is also the chairman
of Hitachi Ltd.
•  Chairman Nakanishi of Keidanren said the group understands the risks associated with climate
change and will seek cooperation with the U.S., the EU and others on decarbonization.
•  Nakanishi believes the difference in energy transition approach between Japan and the EU is that

the latter ignores the option of transition technologies.
•  Nakanishi did not dismiss the idea of a new carbon tax in Japan, but said the pricing mechanism
and how the money raised is then utilized needs to be discussed. Keidanren is working on a set of
recommendations about carbon pricing and will present them to METI. The business group wants
its basic principles set out before debating it with lawmakers.
•  Nakanishi reiterated that “not using nuclear is not an option” for decarbonization and stable

electricity supply reasons.

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Japan has so far missed the boat on new nuclear developments, especially in the area of small
modular reactors, and the country’s companies aren’t deeply involved in this technology, Nakanishi
said.
•  Japan needs a new vision for nuclear and it’s not clear who will bring that, he said.




ENEOS, others testing JEPX-linked pricing plan for electricity for EV drivers

(Japan NRG, Feb. 28)
•  ENEOS, Direct Power and three other firms are testing dynamic pricing for electricity for power
planned to be offered to EV drivers.
•  ENEOS, which is partnering with Nissan Motor on its price tests, is using a market that is a discount
to the 10am to 2pm price levels on the JPEX spot market. The test is being carried out in the
Kyushu area and would see prices change with the seasons.
•  Electricity market-based pricing trials are also being conducted by a JV between Mitsubishi Corp
and Lawson, Direct Power and at least two other firms.




Energy Agency to look for radical ways to boost nuclear output
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 26)
•  The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy has begun a review of ways of improving the

utilization of nuclear power plants.
•  To achieve the government’s target of 20% to 22% of power from nuclear sources by 2030, the
Agency will review options such as the adoption of 10 by 10 fuel rod arrays, the extension of
operation cycles, and the shortening of scheduled maintenance times.



Kansai Electric’s nuclear plants seen as key for Japan cutting plutonium stocks
(Japan NRG, Feb. 26)
•  The Federation for Electric Power Companies, or FEPC, has published plans of its 11 members in
terms of employing plutonium as part of the fuel in their nuclear power stations. Plutonium mixed
with uranium as a fuel is known as Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX).
•  Japan is expected to use only 0.2 tons of plutonium during FY2021, based on an assumption that

Shikoku Electric’s Ikata NPP will restart. The NPP is currently prevented from operating by a court
due to a citizens’ group challenging the reactor’s safety.
•  If Ikata NPP restarts and uses the expected plutonium volume, then the country’s total stocks
would decline to 41.5 tons in the 2021 fiscal year.
•  Next fiscal year and in FY2023, Kansai Electric’s Takahama NPP Units 3 and 4 are seen as the only
facilities that will deploy plutonium from the stocks. The two reactors are expected to require 1.5
tons of plutonium to cut Japan’s total to 40 tons.
•  Kansai Electric owns Japan’s second-largest volume of plutonium at 12.6 tons. TEPCO is the

biggest owner with 13.7 tons.
•  Only four reactors in Japan can employ plutonium, with Kyushu Electric’s Genkai NPP Unit 3 being
the fourth. By 2030, FEPC expects this number to grow to 12 units.

•  Japan’s total used uranium fuel volume stood at 19,040 tons at the end of FY2019, according to
FEPC.
•  The FEPC also said that a Japanese facility would start to produce MOX from FY2026.
• TAKEAWAY: FEPC’s timeline also suggests that the Rokkasho used fuel processing plant would be working at

its 800 tons per year of uranium full capacity only in FY2026. At that point, the plant would extract 6.6 tons of
plutonium from its uranium processing work. Very rough calculations suggest that Japan needs at least 10
reactors to be burning MOX fuel by (or close to) FY2026 in order to make sure plutonium stocks do not rise. At
present, Japan doesn’t have 10 reactors licensed to operate. Unless the country embarks on an aggressive
restart program in the next five years, the plutonium stocks will grow with no end use.

Kansai Electric CEO lends support to new nuclear tech development, eyes green ammonia
(Nikkei, Feb. 26)
o  CEO Mori gave interview to Nikkei, saying the company is exploring how to move away
from generation that emits CO2. This will include the company producing hydrogen, a

fuel Kansai Electric plans to test at its generation facilities.
o  Kansai Electric also wants to supporting the development of new nuclear technologies,
such as Small Modular Rectors and High-Temperature Gas Reactors. These two would be
suitable for Japan, Mori said.
o  The CEO said he is still working on regaining public trust, including of local govt. officials,
so that the utility can restart nuclear reactors, but did not give details on what Kansai
Electric will do with its used nuclear fuel.




Federation of Electric Power Companies lends support to power futures contracts
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Feb. 22)
•  Federation of Electric Power companies chair and Kyushu Electric Power Company CEO, Ikebe

Kazuhiro, said the government’s proposed carbon pricing scheme will be counter-productive if it
results in higher power bills.
•  The Federation maintains that the transition to electricity from other energy sources is an important
part of reducing carbon emissions.
•  Commenting on January’s power shortage, Ikebe said there’s no such thing as a perfect energy
market.

Mitsubishi Corp exits Vietnam coal power plant project amid pressure

(Nikkei, Feb. 25)
•  Japan’s largest trading house decided to exit from the Vinh Tan 3 coal-fired power plant project in
Vietnam amid rising pressure to stop all fossil-fuel related investments.
•  This is the first time a Japanese trading house has withdrawn from a power project on climate
grounds. Mitsubishi said it now plans to contribute to more environmentally friendly power
projects, including in LNG and renewables.

•  The 2 GW Vinh Tan 3, planned for southern Vietnam, is scheduled to come online in 2024. Chinese
companies are handling all the EPC and project financing after several western banks pulled out.
•  CONTEXT: Mitsubishi earlier this year defended its participation in a separate Vung Ang 2 coal-
fired power plant in Vietnam, saying the country’s capital Hanoi is beset by chronic power

shortages and needs a stable power supply. Several Japanese banks are involved in the financing
of Vung Ang 2.
• TAKEAWAY: Mitsubishi is exiting the Vinh Tan 3 but staying in the similar Vung Ang 2 project. The pretext is
climate, but the reality is more complicated. The former is not a national project, whereas Vung Ang 2 is. This
represents the real politik of business that climate activists mostly ignore. If one firm exits, another (which won’t
be swayed by environmental groups) will take its place. For Japanese firms to fully exit all coal-related projects
abroad, they need to know that these same contracts won’t go to Chinese or other rivals – and then be used

against them by local politicians, which may see the exit as a sign of disloyalty.




Japan’s power retailers fear March 5 payment after falling into EPCOs’ trap
(FACTA, February edition)
•  Power Producer and Supplier (PPS) are new electricity firms that came to being after the
liberalization of Japan’s power industry in 2016. Many PPS don’t actually have their own generation
facilities and simply buy electricity on JEPX and then resell it. Until recently, that has provided a
healthy margin of some ¥10 to ¥15 per kWh. However, the January energy crisis, which saw

electricity spot price jump to record levels, burned the PPS very badly.
•  Retailers were lulled into a false sense of security by record-low LNG prices in the first half of 2020
and the drop in power demand soon after the spread of COVID-19.
•  PPS like Shizen Energy, TERA Energy and Minna Denryoku offer electricity prices linked to market
rates. They have over 800,000 customers that use this kind of plan. Due to the spike in electricity
prices in January, the bills of these customers will be 2 to 3 times higher, according to Shizen. That

will encourage many to cancel their contract.
•  PPS would have been protected from this situation had it not been for a change in which the Feed-
In Tariff system for solar and wind wasn’t changed. In 2016, the FIT was linked to retail prices. This
was a trap set by the incumbent regional power utilities, which had foreseen such an emergency
situation and prepared for it.
•  Under the new rules from 2016, when faced with a shortage of electricity available on the
wholesale market, PPS must secure power via the so-called “imbalance price”. The latter is higher

than JEPX spot prices.
•  The imbalance fee is paid on the fifth business day, two months after. So, the PPS are scared of the
“March threat.”
•  PPS companies are lobbying the government to have the incumbent utilities “return” the
unexpected gains they made from the imbalance fee.

New $5.6B fund to buy LNG-powered vessels for Japanese shipping firms
(Nikkei, Feb. 26)
•  A private fund manager, Anchor Ship Partners, plans to start a ¥600 billion ($5.6 billion) fund that
will buy fuel-efficient new LNG carriers (that also run on LNG themselves) and lease them to
Japanese shipping companies such as Nippon Yusen, Mitsui OSK and Kawasaki Kisen.
•  The fund aims to help the shippers decarbonize their operations, and as a result bring more LNG
to Japan, which would help the power utilities switch their generation to gas from oil and coal.
•  The fund may later start to invest in vessels that run on hydrogen and ammonia, and other non-
carbon-based fuels.
•  Anchor Ship Partners is raising financing from regional banks and other financial institutions in
Japan on the promise of double-digit returns.

INPEX makes its first acquisition of carbon credits via Indonesia project
(Japan NRG, Feb. 23)
•  Oil and gas producer INPEX said it has entered into an agreement with conservation firm

InfiniteEARTH to acquire 5 million tons worth of carbon credits over five years.
•  The project involves forest conservation in the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve on Indonesia’s part
of the island of Borneo. The carbon credits are verified under the UN’s REDD+ scheme.
• TAKEAWAY: This is the company’s first foray into carbon credits. It helps the company show that it is
decarbonizing the business, and it also offers INPEX an option to start offering carbon-neutral LNG plans,
which could be added to its Ichthys LNG portfolio. For details on what is carbon-neutral LNG and how it works,
see the Feb. 15 edition of Japan NRG.

ANALYSIS

Japan mulls domestic carbon tax but forgets the obvious:

Carbon is global and so its tax must also be

In the last month, several key government committees discussed how Japan should
act regarding setting a price on carbon emissions. Ideas range from setting a border
fee taxing goods produced in places with “insufficient environmental measures”, to
bolstering Japan’s nascent carbon credit mechanisms. There’s even talk of tying
carbon pricing to the development of CCS technology inside Japan.

The arguments within government, academia, and business circles will likely go on for
the rest of the year. Yet, there is one basic truth that Japan cannot avoid when
discussing carbon pricing: CO2 emissions are not restricted by national borders and,
therefore, any scheme implemented by Japan has to be part of a global initiative.

Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, formerly Japan’s chief climate negotiator and a member of
the UN Secretary-General’s High-level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing
(AGF), tells Japan NRG that the country’s best chance to keep competitive, while
moving forward with a levy on emissions, will be to support the creation of a new
international carbon market system, and outlines how one could work in practice.


BY MUTSUYOSHI NISHIMURA
FORMER DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS,
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE UN CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS
Putting a price on carbon emissions creates an added financial burden for polluters.
As such, it forces companies to include the carbon cost in their price of
goods/services, reduce their CO2 output and invest in cleaner technologies.

There are two main types of carbon pricing: emissions trading systems (ETS) and
carbon taxes. Japan has done neither of these so far, mostly because its business
community feared losing its competitive edge against overseas peers.

Instead, Japan created several limited-application carbon reduction schemes that
were entirely voluntary, and touted “PR effects” and lower running costs among their
core benefits. The schemes were merged in 2013 into a unified J-Credit system.

The unification opened up the credits to bilateral trading, and firms can even buy
them at government auctions. However, it’s safe to say that the J-Credit scheme is a
minor blip on the Japanese industrial landscape. By June 2020 its cumulative number
of projects registered over eight years was 325. These projects are set to remove a
mere 13 million tons of CO2 before 2030 – equivalent to 1% of the country’s annual
carbon emissions total.

What’s worse, the pace of projects applying for J-Credits has slowed to a trickle, with
just 26 added in 2019.

Of course, the entire landscape changed in October last year when Prime Minister
Suga vowed that Japan would achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The momentum

18


CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

has carried on, and with growing pressure at policy level PM Suga was compelled to
declare on Jan. 18 this year that Japan will adopt “carbon pricing that would lead [the
country] to economic growth”.

Compared to the action (or lack thereof) in the last two decades, this represents a
major leap in Japan’s decarbonization efforts. However, it also creates an enormous
challenge to transform the economy in less than 30 years. So, can it really also lead to
economic growth?


Can carbon tax really lead to growth?
Judging by recent media reports, the Suga government is preparing to introduce a
carbon tax system with a possible price converging mechanism vis-a-vis competing
countries.

Carbon tax is supposed to work as an incentive for firms to reduce emissions by
quickly installing more modern technologies. But, this is only in theory. In practice, if
the carbon tax is set too high, companies cannot afford new clean technologies.

On the other hand, if the government is too soft on the carbon tax, firms may simply
choose to pay the levy rather than pursue emissions reductions any time soon.

This makes the carbon tax a very tricky mechanism to manage for a bureaucracy and,
in truth, nobody knows if it will lead to economic growth. Furthermore, coordinating a
new tax on carbon with other tax systems in Japan and abroad, plus managing the tax
against the rising and falling prices of goods and services, is bound to be a thorny and
exhausting issue for all governments. At some point, the lure of protectionism for
domestic industry will come through.

The way to avoid the extra bureaucracy and politics would be to adopt a market-
based pricing system. Several microcosms of carbon pricing already exist around the
world, most famously perhaps in the EU. However, the fact that they work separately
makes it very hard to utilize them as an effective tool to stop climate change. After all,
CO2 emissions are global and have an impact on the entire planet, no matter where
they’re released.

If we can create a global commodity market for crude oil, which while separated by
blends and bourses is intricately linked, we should aim to do so for CO2. No matter
where it’s traded, CO2 prices around the world must converge in a narrow band.

A CO2 price signal that’s ascending is just as important as carbon pricing itself. It
shows the danger of staying put for too long with old technologies.

Moreover, we need an ascending price signal for businesses to take continual
decarbonizing actions on a long-term basis. Again, such an approach is very tough to
implement for a bureaucracy.

With the above conditions in mind, here is a proposal for an alternative to the
Japanese carbon pricing system.

PROPOSAL: a new International Carbon Price System

We need a new international carbon market system that both allows for the price formation of a universal
carbon price and one that continuously rises in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In practice, it
could work like this.

1. Creating a fully global system would take an enormous amount of time and diplomatic effort,
so a new carbon market system could be created in a more compact and manageable
format. The top 20 emitting countries account for about 80% of the global CO2 total each
year. All but two of these countries (Iran and Poland) are also members of the G20. Starting
dialog via an existing international institution would save time in creating a new global
carbon market.

Global CO2 Emissions by Country






















2. So far, more than 110 countries have made pledges to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by
2050. (The only major standout is China, whose goal is for 2060.) Assuming that the Top 20
emitters all share the same timeline, we can plot a basic “Carbon Budget” for the bloc,
based on their aggregated emissions in a recent year. For example, in 2018.













20


CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

The “Carbon Budget” represents the maximum amount of CO2 that can be emitted before 2050 while
still meeting climate targets. The budget will give rise to an ascending pricing signal for carbon.


3. The international carbon market rules:

3.1. The market would work by offering a limited number of emissions permits, with the limit
imposed by the Carbon Budget. Firms would buy the permits in correspondence with the
carbon content of their operations. This would apply to all CO2 emissions, including fossil
fuel extraction, transport and combustion.
3.2. The permits would be verified by each country’s Customs Office when fossil fuels are
imported. The same verification applies when fossil fuels are extracted and burned in the
same country.
3.3. Firms would then pass on the carbon cost to the downstream. So, a steelmaker would add
their carbon cost to the cost of a steel sheet, which when used to make a car would be
added to the sale price of the auto. This is a neat way to realize the environmental
economists’ most cherished “polluter pays” principle.
3.4. The global carbon market should be managed by an international secretariat. Perhaps, it can
be linked to an existing international body to save time. Operational costs should be small as
everything would be done digitally.
3.5. Funds raised from the sale of permits will be used based on the agreement of the
participating countries. Ideally, part of the money would go to support developing nations in
the form of subsidies for decarbonization initiatives and technology.
3.6. Those that transgress the market’s rules or cheat would face strict penalties.

Geothermal: Japan’s Overlooked Renewable Energy Source

Renewable energy is often criticized for its inability to deliver electricity as reliably as a
coal-fired or nuclear power plant. Japan, however, classifies one renewable source as
“base-load.” It is also the source the country is richly blessed in: geothermal energy.

The amount of heat within 10 km of the Earth’s surface contains 50,000 times the
energy of all the world’s oil and gas resources, according to the International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Japan is more serious about tapping that
potential. The government set an ambitious target of more than tripling geothermal’s
share of the electricity mix and loosened legislation to favor development. In addition,
Japan already has companies that rule the global market for geothermal turbines.

For all of the ambition, however, Japan’s ability to realize its target looks uncertain.


In a different league
Geothermal is the only renewable energy source classified as "base-load power" –
meaning one that can work around the clock and independently of weather conditions
– according to the country's latest Strategic Energy Plan. This ranks geothermal
alongside nuclear and thermal power in terms of being a stable energy supplier, in
contrast with intermittent sources such as solar and wind.

Unlike its nuclear fleet, geothermal also benefits from Japan’s tricky geology that has
the country hug the volcano-rich Ring of Fire. The country has potential for at least
23.47 GW of geothermal capacity, ranking third in the world after the U.S. and
Indonesia, according to Japan’s own figures.

Still, progress in developing the resource has been slow. Data shows that as of 2017
Japan’s installed geothermal capacity was about 0.55 GW, up just 3% from a decade
ago. In 2019, IRENA estimated capacity at 525 MW, meaning that only 2% of total
potential is utilized.

Japan gets just 0.3% of its electricity from geothermal facilities, barely placing the
country in the Top 10 countries for volume of electricity from this source. This
contrasts with progress elsewhere. Global geothermal capacity rose to 13.9 GW in
2019, up 37.3% since 2011, according to IRENA. The World Geothermal Congress
reports an annual compound growth rate for geothermal direct utilization at 8.7%.

Japan’s lawmakers have tried to reverse course and bring more business interest to
the sector. A non-partisan geothermal energy caucus of Japan’s Diet was established
with Nikai, the current secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as a co-
head. Nikai is credited with helping to install current Prime Minister Suga in power.

The government has also made geothermal power applicable for the Feed-In Tariff
system, which helped fuel massive investments into solar over the last decade.

Most notably, relaxed laws on development inside national parks opened up more of
the country’s geothermal capacity and METI is seeking to shorten the average
development period of a project from 14 years to less than 10 years through faster
drilling and environmental assessment. Also, the national budget for geothermal
power, mainly consisting of subsidies for potential surveys and drilling activities, has
increased.

Progress on the ground
Although excavation surveys and environmental assessments are currently conducted
at about 100 sites across the country, many are small-sized because the geothermal
fluid reservoirs are scattered around volcanos, mainly in Tohoku and Kyushu regions.
That leaves only a handful of large-scale projects on the horizon.

Apart from the Ministry of Environment, which mainly focuses on binary generators
around hot springs, geothermal power development is handled by the Policy Planning
Division of Natural Resources and Fuel Department in the Agency for Natural
Resources and Energy (ANRE), which is subordinate to METI.

The second driver of geothermal projects in Japan is the quasi-governmental resource
company, Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC), which is tasked
with identifying new development sites. An accurate, publicly available map showing
good candidate sites is still lacking, according to geothermal industry experts.

While China is ahead of Japan in the production of solar and wind energy equipment,
Japanese companies have a stronger presence in geothermal power generation. Fuji
Electric, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems manufacture turbines for
geothermal power generation, and altogether they have more than 60% of the global
market. These turbines are often tailor-made.

Against this backdrop, trading companies such as Marubeni, Itochu, Sumitomo, and
Toyota Trading have taken the lead in exporting the package infrastructure, for
example to Kenya and Indonesia, which are now bigger geothermal power producers
than Japan.

Also, representing regions where geothermal power resources are concentrated,
Tohoku Electric and Kyushu Electric are not only building facilities at home but also
actively participating in overseas projects through capital investment. This will become
important as global systems evolve, with the new Enhanced Geothermal Systems
(EGS) technology being receiving wide attention in the U.S. and Europe.

The government has set a target of renewable energy generating 22-24 % of
electricity by 2030, with geothermal supplying 1.6 GW, or 1-1.1% of Japan's energy
needs, about triple the current level. However, with few new large-scale projects at
this point and the lack of clear strategies, many believe the 2030 goal is unachievable.

Given the fact that nearly 80% of geothermal resources are located in national parks,
deregulation is paramount. In an interview with Nikkei last October, Environment
Minister Koizumi hinted at further relaxation of restrictions imposed on national parks
in order to encourage the building of geothermal and other renewable energy plants.


The risks of development
Geothermal power development in Japan is fraught with risk and high cost. Promising
sites are often in mountainous regions rather than in flat territory. Finding a profitable
geothermal source requires long-term drilling surveys, and developers are reluctant
because of the risk of wasting investment if they can’t find one.

Close to 30% of a geothermal plant’s development cost in Japan comes from initial
surveys and planning, according to NEDO. Plants also take three to four years to
construct, less than offshore wind developments, but longer than solar.

Worse still, potential geothermal power generation sites often overlap with hot spring
resorts, making it difficult to convince residents who are concerned about the impact
on hot spring sources. Reflecting this concern, the government set up an advisory
committee inside JOGMEC, offering relevant analysis data to municipalities upon
request.

The industry finally had something to cheer when Japan’s first 10 MW-plus
geothermal project in 23 years opened in Akita prefecture in May 2019. The 46MW
Wasabizawa Geothermal Power Plant has a double-flash cycle system and is a joint
development from J-Power, Mitsubishi Materials, and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical.

The next big step for geothermals in Japan may come this summer, when the
government is due to update its Strategic Energy Plan. There’s expectation that the
target portion of renewable energy sources will be raised. Some lawmakers argue
geothermal energy should even take center stage.

While that may seem fanciful, geothermal power has the ingredients to generate 1%
of the country’s electricity by 2030, as per current target. It will be up to the new
Strategy to show industry that the government is serious about turning that potential
into reality.

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Latin America:
Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro fired the CEO of Petrobras, the country’s oil
monopoly, last week. Outgoing CEO, Roberto Castelo Branco, will be replaced by
Army General Joaquim Silva e Luna who has no prior energy industry experience.
Castelo Branco had sought to increase gasoline and diesel prices by between 10% to
15%, a move that Bolsonaro objected to. Petrobras’ stock price dropped by 20% in
Sao Paolo after the announcement. Petrobras has a market capitalization of $4 billion
and Castelo Branco had reduced Petrobras debt by $30 billion over the last two years.
Petrobras’ oil production is over 2 million bpd, 90% of which is deep-water offshore.
Bolsonaro faces an election in 2022.

Mexico’s President Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador (‘AMLO’) passed a law in the
lower house of parliament last week that gives priority grid access to the state
electricity monopoly, CPE, over private sector utilities. This effectively cancels
important parts of the 2013 energy legislation enacted by AMLO’s predecessor that
opened Mexico’s energy markets to foreign investors.

Oil & Gas:
1). Brent prices closed February up over 20% for the month, or $12 a barrel ending
the month at $66. The next OPEC+ meeting will be held this week on Thursday and
Friday.
2). Stronger oil prices enabled Saudi Arabia to raise $1.8 billion in sovereign debt on
Wednesday that had a negative 6 basis point yield.
3). J-K-M gas prices in Asia dropped to $5.9 mmbtu on Friday about 80% lower than
the January peak.

EVs:
1). Lucid, the Silicon Valley EV maker, will go public in a $24 billion SPAC deal backed
by Michael Klein, the former Citigroup executive. Lucid is 85% owned by Saudi
Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has 2,000 employees, and operates a manufacturing
facility in Arizona. The Lucid Air is expected to go on sale this year.
2). Fisker, the Californian EV manufacturer, has signed a collaboration agreement with
Foxconn

Batteries:
Californian battery maker Enovix will go public via a SPAC, having raised $400 million
last week. The company makes silicon lithium-ion batteries.

Power Infrastructure:
Three European power cable manufacturers, Prysmian, Nexans, and NKT, have
doubled their market capitalizations since March 2020 as demand for undersea high-
voltage lines surges because of developments in offshore wind and the broader
energy transition.
