Japan sets up scheme to prolong service of aging thermal plants as capacity shrinks

(Japan NRG, Sept. 24)
•  By the end of 2022, Japan is due to lose 3.17 GW of thermal power capacity as aging plants close.
So, with power supply-balance forecasts of shortages over the next few years, METI decided to
launch a new “matchmaking” system to prolong the service of retiring plants.
•  METI will allow electricity retail firms to offer bids to keep the facilities in business. If the offers are
insufficient, the plants will close.
•  To create this “matchmaking” process, METI will conduct a thorough review of each power unit

that’s been scheduled by their owner for closure. At present, there’s 3 GW of LNG-fired capacity
and 170 MW of coal-fired capacity due to close.
•  Before being allowed to shutter the plants, operators will be asked to disclose all the key operating
details and running costs to the grid oversight body, OCCTO. Based on this info, OCCTO will post
online the cost of keeping the plant operational and other details, and open it to bids from other
electricity companies.

•  The first online matchmaking will start this or next month.
•  METI will also continue to look for other ways to restart idled plants to secure more power capacity
for FY2022. It's encouraging local power suppliers in areas with shortages to cooperate to secure
more capacity.
•  CONTEXT: Both METI experts and OCCTO have warned that the Tokyo area, and other major
urban centers will face power shortages over winter/spring in the next two years. In winter of 2023,

Tokyo demand could outstrip supply by more than 2%, should the area experience a cold snap,
according to OCCTO forecasts.
• TAKEAWAY: Just a year after METI said it’d seek to close most coal-fired power plants, top grid officials now
want to achieve the opposite. Based on OCCTO’s scenarios, the nation’s grid is simply not ready to ditch the
old energy system because there is not enough new, clean generation to take its place. There are different
ways to read it, but the numbers suggest there’s plenty of demand for new power capacity in Japan.

Tokio Marine no longer insuring coal miners
(Nikkei Shimbun, Kankyo Business, Sept. 27)
•  As of October, Tokio Marine and Nichido won’t insure or finance coal development projects,
making it the first Japanese insurance company to divest from the sector.

•  Japan’s annual market for coal mining insurance is about ¥10 billion.
•  CONTEXT: This makes the company Japan’s first insurer to pull out of the sector.
• TAKEAWAY: The move by Tokyo Marine is likely to be followed by close rivals Sompo Japan and Mitsui
Sumitomo. While the actions are very much in line with current trend to decarbonize, they are at odds with the
power industry and government stance of trying to keep older coal-fired units online at least for the next few
years in order to prevent capacity shortages. If the stations are kept, but their insurance and other support

lapses, the cost of thermal power will rise.


Japan sets terms for offshore wind project bids in the Happo/Noshiro zone

(Japan NRG, Sept. 30)
•  METI disclosed the terms based on which operators will be selected to run offshore wind projects
in the Happo Town and Noshiro City (Akita prefecture) zone.
•  CONTEXT: This area was designated as a preferred promotional area for offshore wind a few
weeks earlier, on Sept. 13.
•  The terms include conditions that:
•  The operator contributes 0.5% of revenue from power sales to a local community fund for a 20

year-period.
•  The operator conducts studies on the potential impact from the project on the fishing community
one year before the start of construction and honors the views presented by professionals close to
the project and by the fishing community.
•  The operator holds consultations with the fishing community and local boat operators on
navigation rules in the waters around the offshore turbines.
•  METI also clarified that the process of selecting operators for the promotion zone will take around

eight months. The authorities will take two months to set area access rules and details. Pre-
screening to determine the qualifications of the bidding company will take another two months.
Final evaluations, with input from the Akita governor, the METI minister, the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport and a third-party committee, will take three months.
•  The rules for Happo / Noshiro area also preclude applications from disclosing their project details
before placing an official bid in order to avoid interactions with other applicants.

This is different from the approach in previous wind zones.
•  Finally, applicants will need to describe their Covid prevention measures.
•  The evaluation will be scored out of 120, 80 of which will represent an assessment
of the technical specifications and the rest of the community engagement /
relationship.
• TAKEAWAY: The terms for this area seem more granular than in previous cases and more
specific around surveys, ship navigation rules, and interactions with the local community.

• Akita prefecture is now home to three of the five major offshore preferred zones set out by
the government and it also has the Oga/Katagami/Akita City coastline that’s classified as “a
promising area”. The latter signifies that consultations with the local community and field

5

surveys are less advanced that in a “preferred zone”. There are seven coastal zones around Japan that are
certified as “preferred”.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hokkaido snubbed by government wind strategy
(Nikkei, Sept. 27)
o  Plans to build several wind farms off Hokkaido’s coast may come unstuck after it was
revealed that not a single Hokkaido site made a recent METI list of promising sites for
wind development.

o  A similar list in 2020 classified Hokkaido sites Gan’u, Minami-Shiribeshi, and Hiyama as
‘likely to become promising in future’, but no Hokkaido sites made the grade this year;
the honor instead went to Yamagata.
o  To make the list, sites must demonstrate sufficient grid capacity.
o  The large number of solar farms in Hokkaido means there’s little surplus grid capacity for
wind generators; wind farms would have to settle for ‘non-firm’ grid connections that
enable them to sell electricity at off-peak times.

• TAKEAWAY: TEPCO is one of the companies seeking to build an offshore farm in the Happo / Noshiro zone
(See the Power Markets section for details). Given the propensity of METI to give TEPCO a leg-up at many
occasions, it would not be a surprise to see the fastest developments occur in zones where TEPCO is bidding.




Environment Ministry publishes general policies on scrapping offshore wind facilities
(Japan NRG, Sept. 30)
•  The MoE has published the general policies on scrapping fixed foundation offshore wind turbines
based on proposals from an expert panel.
•  The policies allow for some equipment to be dumped in the sea due to the technical challenges of

bringing it onshore. Operators will need to get prior ministry approval to make sure the action has
limited environmental impact.


METI publishes risk management principles for the power sector
(Japan NRG, Sept. 24)
•  A METI panel drafted a set of risk management principles for the power sector that are based on

lessons from the January electricity price spike.
•  The principles are not legally binding, but describe best practices for power firms to cope with
unexpected events in the market. The ministry urges operators and retailers to spend time to
identify and analyze supply side risks and to consider the potential for capacity to come offline.
•  Over half of power retailers haven’t assessed the impact of spot market volatility, the panel on
electricity and gas policy said in its principles document draft.
•  The panel also suggested the formation of a group for retailers to negotiate with power generators

and to oversee changes in the supply and demand balance.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
EGC wants to revise power retail guidelines on market-linked rates
(Japan NRG, Sept. 24)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) proposed to alter the
guidelines for power retailers following consumer complaints over the price increase in
January, when the electricity price suddenly spiked.
o  The regulator wants retailers to provide written communication to consumers describing
the risks associated with tariff plans that are linked to wholesale prices. The officials want

consumers to be able to check the rate changes.
• TAKEAWAY: The fallout from the power price spike in January continues and is all the more pertinent given
the chance of a repeat this winter. Although METI’s surveys suggest many power retailers are still not taking
adequate measures to protect their price risk exposure, in the event of a crisis the officials want to be able to
say that everyone had been warned. The recent defaults of several UK power and gas retailers should act as
another warning for companies in Japan.



Environment Ministry to subsidize 19 JCM projects in 2H 2021

(Japan NRG, Sept. 28)
•  The MoE will subsidize 19 carbon reduction projects in six countries under the Joint Credit
Mechanism (JCM) framework for the second half of this year. The projects promise to cut 100,000
tons of CO2/ year.
•  Almost half of the projects involve installing solar panels at manufacturing plants.



IMO to release guidelines for carbon neutral shipping

(Kankyo Business, Sept. 24)
•  The International Maritime Organization, the UN agency responsible for preventing marine
pollution, began debating guidelines for assessing maritime greenhouse gas emissions.
•  Japan, Australia and Norway proposed a scheme distinguishing between land-based greenhouse
gas emissions (fuel production and supply) and emissions at sea, thereby preventing them being
counted twice.




Tidal generation gets boost as Kyushu Electric touts its commercial promise
(Nikkei, Sept. 24)
•  Kyushu Electric subsidiary Kyuden Mirai Energy recently began generating electricity from a tidal
generation system installed in Nagasaki.
•  Other operators, including Chubu Electric, have started investing in overseas tidal generation

schemes.
•  It’s estimated that Japanese waters could generate as much as 4 GW of tidal electricity.
•  Electricity generated from tidal energy is less subject to fluctuation than that from solar or wind
farms. Additionally, tidal generation systems, being underwater, do not raise issues of visual
pollution.
•  On the downside, tidal generation systems are not readily scalable.

J-Power touts new form of carbon storage under the sea via hydrates
(Newswitch, Sept. 27)
•  J-Power is working on technology to store sequestered CO2 on the seafloor as CO2 hydrates--a
technology that has so far received little attention.

•  Comprising combinations of one molecule of CO2 and six molecules of water, CO2 hydrates are
denser than water and do not rise to the surface.
•  The technology involves first depositing a layer of solid CO2 on the seafloor to act as a barrier.
Additional CO2 can then be injected under the barrier.
•  The Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth estimates 150 billion metric tons of
CO2 could be stored around Japan as hydrates.


Tokyo governor may make rooftop solar mandatory

(Nikkei, Sept. 28)
•  Tokyo Governor Koike Yuriko is considering making photovoltaic panels mandatory on new
residential buildings.
•  In future, the government will debate what section/building sizes would be subject to the new rules
and when the rules should come into effect.
•  The national government has set a target of having PV panels fitted to the roofs of 60% of all new
residential buildings by 2030.




Mitsui to invest over ¥100 bn in Australian blue ammonia plant
(Nikkei Shimbun, Oct. 1)
•  Trading house Mitsui & Co. plans to invest more than ¥100 billion to build a “blue” ammonia
production plant in Western Australia. The plant would ship 1 million tons of the fuel to Japan

annually.
•  The ammonia would be produced with natural gas from a nearby gas field, in which Mitsui has a
50% stake. The CO2 generated during the process of converting natural gas to ammonia will be
extracted, compressed, and stored in a waste gas field nearby.
•  Mitsui hopes to start ammonia exports to Japan in 2028.
•  Wesfarmers, an Australian conglomerate that already operates an ammonia plant in Western
Australia, will work with Mitsui on the project, and Japan’s state-backed JOGMEC Corp. will be

involved in the CO2 storage part.



Kyushu Electric partners with Yara to develop blue and green ammonia
(Company statement, Sept. 27)
•  Kyushu Electric signed an accord with Yara International (Norway), the world's largest manufacturer

of nitrogenous fertilizers, to collaborate on both blue and green ammonia.
•  The two companies will discuss (1) the establishment of a supply chain from production of clean
ammonia to its use at power plants, and (2) the establishment of a receiving and shipping system
for clean ammonia to be widely used in the Kyushu area.

(New Energy Business News, Sept. 28)
•  Toshiba and trading house Sojitz signed an agreement with Brazil's CBMM for the
commercialization of next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LiB) using niobium-titanium oxides
(NTOs).
•  NTO is a material with twice the theoretical volume capacity density compared to graphite, which
is generally used as a negative electrode material for LiB.
•  CBMM already has a contract with Volkswagen Kaminyois y Onibus, a developer of electric trucks

in Latin America, and will demonstrate its next-generation LiB using NTO. Toshiba and Sojitz will
cooperate in this demonstration and gather the data.
•  Niobium is mainly used as an additive in high-grade steel materials such as high-strength steel and
stainless steel. CBMM is the world’s biggest producer and seller of niobium. Sojitz is a shareholder
in CBMM and the Brazilian firm’s distributor in Japan.




Kirin to install solar panels at all Japanese factories
(Smart Japan, Sept. 29)
•  Kirin Beer will install photovoltaic panels at its Hokkaido, Ibaraki and Okayama factories in a bid to
increase to over 30% the percentage of its electricity that’s renewably generated.
•  Work to install the panels will be completed by January.

Cheaper daytime electricity on the cards as METI wants more client options
(Nikkei, Sept. 27)
•  METI is considering forcing utilities to offer subscribers the option of cheaper electricity during
periods of maximum sunlight to better utilize surplus electricity from solar farms.
•  Currently, output restrictions mean that solar generators are often unable to generate maximum
output during sunny periods. In 2019, output from solar farms was restricted on 74 days of the year

for this reason.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE studies ways to limit curtailment of renewable energy output
(Japan NRG, Sept. 30)
o  The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy is studying new mechanisms to improve
day-to-day control over supply and demand electricity balances in order to allow for

wider use of variable renewable energy.
o  Among the measures are more efficient curtailment procedures, having more renewable
energy capacity available online to create a faster response, decreasing the minimum
power generation levels for thermal and biomass plants, using more storage batteries,
and increasing power transmission bandwidth.
o  ANRE plans to finalize its studies and recommendations by the end of 2021.
•  CONTEXT: Curtailment of solar and wind capacity in some regions is wasting as much as two-

thirds of output on certain days, as well as costing operators profits.


JERA to invest $1.58bn in Philippine utility Aboitiz

(Nikkei Asia, Sept. 27)

•  Philippines is a fast-growing power market, and it’s transitioning away from coal to cleaner fuels.
Aboitiz has just 4.6 GW of power capacity today, but expects to double that by 2030 with almost
50% of the new total coming from renewable sources.
•  JERA said it will offer the Philippines utility both its thermal power and clean energy experience,

for example switching coal generation to ammonia.
•  JERA said it believed that LNG or renewable energy alone cannot drive decarbonization effectively
in the Philippines.
•  CONTEXT: Philippines is also a growth market for LNG, which opens opportunities for JERA to
secure a solid customer base.

Fukushima orchards not receiving promised compensation
(Mainichi Shimbun, Sept. 18)
•  Orchard operators whose reputation was damaged by the Fukushima nuclear disaster get less
compensation than TEPCO initially promised,
•  In some cases, the amounts of compensation offered are nearly 10 times less than promised.

•  TEPCO changed the formula used to calculate compensation to orchards in 2019 to one based on
the average market price for fruit in the five years before the accident.



TEPCO needs to get serious about reform

(Nikkei editorial, Sept. 25)
•  CONTEXT: The Nikkei is Japan’s most influential business media.
•  Restarting the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata prefecture is vital as TEPCO misses out on ¥50
billion of annual revenue. This money is needed to fund Fukushima’s rebuild and compensate
those affected by the disaster.
•  TEPCO’s lax attitude to safety betrays the trust of the Niigata community.
•  The drop in morale in the company, exemplified by similar compliance breaches regarding

seismometers at Fukushima, is cause for concern.

Japan continues to show appetite for small LNG cargoes from Africa

(Japan NRG, Sept. 30)
•  Japan continued to buy small LNG volumes from African sellers after losing suppliers from Peru
LNG in May due to production issues.
•  In August, Japan imported 65,368 tons of LNG from Egypt and 62,419 tons from Nigeria, after
buying 67,582 tons from Guinea in June.
•  CONTEXT: Japan seldom takes such small import volumes, the equivalent of one ship cargo,
preferring to work with regular sellers on a series of deliveries.
•  Imports from Peru amounted to 533,846 tons over January-April this year, and totaled 626,668

tons in 2020.

ANALYSIS

BY TAKEHIRO MASUTOMO


Choice of Mr. Kishida as Japan!s Next Leader Means
A Step Back from Drastic Changes in Energy Policy

Japan will not ditch nuclear, and the energy mix will continue to be diversified: those
are the key signals from last week’s ruling party leadership race that produced Japan’s
next prime minister.

The win by former foreign affairs minister Kishida Fumio was a vote against radical
shifts in current energy policy, rejecting both anti-nuclear and renewables-sceptic
candidates. The strong focus on social equality in Kishida’s platform also suggests that
his approach to the energy transition would prioritize affordability and seek to avoid
major job losses and other disruptions.

Outgoing PM Suga lasted only a year in the job, but his surprise announcement that
Japan will move to decarbonize is certain to continue. Suga’s Green Growth Strategy
championed the development of an offshore wind sector, while expanding on earlier
hydrogen policies and urging faster transitions to clean energy for manufacturers.

While Suga’s main tenets will stay, Kishida’s immediate challenge will be to bridge the
ideological rifts that have dogged Japan’s energy debate over the past year. He won’t
have much time to accomplish that. The latest Basic Energy Plan, now in public
review, is due for Cabinet approval in mid-October. Also, key global forums such as
the G20 in Rome and COP26 in Glasgow are only weeks away.

Most importantly, Kishida will soon face a general election. He’ll want to keep all sides
hopeful. Even if he attends COP26, his message is more likely to be aspirational than
concrete.


Industry Friendly
Kishida was born into a political family in Tokyo. Both his father and grandfather had
close ties to the !Kochikai” faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that
prioritizes the economy, and which has links to the METI predecessor, Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI). Kishida has led this mid-sized faction since
2012.

It is also noteworthy that Kishida’s bureaucrat-turned-politician father was once
appointed as chief of the state SME Agency. Kishida himself has often advocated for
SMEs and industrial sectors. His constituency (Hiroshima, 1st District) is located near
the HQ of automaker Mazda. Tellingly, he had an arranged marriage with a former
Mazda employee.

Between 2012-2017, Kishida served as Foreign Minister in PM Abe’s Cabinet, and
later he was assigned as chairperson of the LDP’s core Policy Research Council,
suggesting that he has an understanding of a number of fields. Still, his key political
ambitions have long remained unclear.

| Choice of Mr. Kishida as Japan!s Next Leader Means |
| --- |
| A Step Back from Drastic Changes in Energy Policy |

His first book, Kishida Vision, published in 2020, gave some glimpses of policy
direction and a brief outlook on energy. !In the future, renewable energy sources such
as offshore wind, geothermal, and solar power should be the main sources of power,
and dependence on nuclear should be reduced,” Kishida wrote. This position would
later deviate from the one he took during the LDP race.

In the book, he also called for Japan to become a leader in environmental
issues. From an industrial policy perspective, he argued that Japan should contribute
to the world by developing technologies for electricity storage, hydrogen, CCSU, and
new materials with low environmental impact such as gallium nitride, a compound
used for semiconductors. Kishida also said he believes the government should invest
in these areas.


Kono Vs Anyone-But-Kono
As the four candidates vied for leadership of the LDP, a surprisingly large portion of
their debates and media coverage centered on energy policy. In part, this was
because frontrunner Kono Taro had been openly anti-nuclear throughout his career,
while supporting maximum use of renewables, an unusual position in a party that had
always stood behind nuclear.

Rival candidate Takaichi Sanae took an almost opposite stance to Kono. The former
home affairs minister, promoted by former PM Abe, strongly backed more use of
nuclear tech while casting doubt on the extent to which Japan should embrace
variable renewable sources such as solar.

This debate extends beyond electricity. Japan’s nuclear policy includes support for
the nuclear fuel cycle – the idea that used fuel can be recycled many times before
expiry. However, this vision has proved challenging to achieve technically, as well as
very expensive. It also involves the handling of plutonium, a material that can be
deployed in weapons. For all that, the nuclear fuel cycle is a technological and
security issue that binds Japan and the U.S. Raising questions about this inside the
LDP has been almost taboo. And so Kono’s opposition to nuclear power, which he
somewhat dialed back during the campaign, raised concerns not only among those
involved in nuclear energy.

It’s telling that Takaichi managed to grow support as the campaign went on partly
based on her rhetoric around nuclear energy.

As Kono and Takaichi clashed over nuclear and renewables, Kishida kept the middle
ground. Kishida vowed he would proceed with the restart of nuclear plants across the
nation and he defended the nuclear fuel cycle, but also stressed his backing for the
maximum deployment of renewable energy, particularly regarding R&D into storage
batteries.

Kishida even declared that his administration would put forward a !national strategy
for nuclear energy”, and lent support for new nuclear technologies, such as SMRs.

The reason Kishida’s stance was more accommodating on nuclear than in his 2020
book seems largely due to who supported his election.



19


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Business-connected LDP heavyweight Amari Akira publicly welcomed Kishida’s entry
into the race. Of the 20 lawmakers needed to officially launch a leadership bid,
Kishida got the support of current METI minister Kajiyama and other junior MPs known
for energy and nuclear expertise.

Kishida gained ballots from the top two fractions, which are largely under the control
of former PM Abe and his longtime ally and deputy PM, Aso Taro.

Big business also backed Kishida, or at least anyone but Kono. Keidanren’s chairman
voiced his support for Kishida before the campaign even began. The President of
Toyota, who also heads the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, made
skeptical comments about the pace of the EV rollout that seemed like a veiled dig at
Kono.

Energy industry groups, such as the Federation of Electric Power Companies, openly
spoke of !any candidate but Kono”, while former top METI executive Imai Takaya,
now an adviser to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, reportedly joined Kishida’s camp as a
policy advisor and pushed a message to the business world that Kono will dismantle
Japan’s nuclear industry.

Kono’s renewables-first position was painted as an unbalanced vision for Japan’s
energy grid and one that could disrupt electricity supply. Kishida won for his portfolio
approach.

Of course, the view of LDP members, and even big business executives, is not the
same as that of the general public. Still, recent opinion polls show anti-nuclear
sentiment is waning since the post-Fukushima period when it spurred mass street
demonstrations.

In a recent poll for the left-leaning newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, 48% of respondents
said the next prime minister should denuclearize the energy sector, while 40% said
this is not necessary.

While local governments make the final decision on reactor restarts, many will look to
the prime minister and his government for a sense of direction.

So far, Kishida’s reported picks for his Cabinet suggest state backing for pro-nuclear
policies will remain and probably accelerate. Aspirations to grow other non-fossil-fuel
sources will also remain.

On Oct. 8, Kishida will deliver a general policy speech in the Diet. At the same
juncture last year, Suga announced the commitment to decarbonization.

Until Kishida secures a majority for his party in a general election, however, he is more
likely to say that various options can be considered for Japan’s future energy policy.

race.

ANALYSIS

BY SAKI ISETANI

Japan Seeks a New Cement Recipe to Tame Major CO2 Emitter
As the main raw material for concrete, cement is responsible for 4% of Japan’s total
CO2 emissions. To tackle the issue and improve the industry’s green credentials,
Japan is switching to a new recipe that promises to suck up more CO2 than it emits.

Several groups of private Japanese companies and scientific institutions recently
developed new cement and concrete techniques that create material from CO2, or
that absorb it. One such innovative cement, developed by Taisei Corp, claims to lock
up to 170 kg of CO2 per cubic meter of concrete, which gives the material a negative
carbon footprint.

Together with applying carbon capture systems, the government hopes such
innovations will accelerate the decarbonization process of domestic construction firms,
which lately has been slowing.

The roadmap for greening cement is part of the broader “Environment Innovation
Strategy” that METI launched in January 2020, and which aims to leverage low-carbon
emission technologies in heavy-emitting sectors.


Background

As of 2021, Japan has 30 cement factories, with an annual cement
clinker production capacity of about 53.7 million tons. The Kanto
district is the nation’s largest cement production center, with six
plants.

Why decarbonize cement?
After power-generation and steelmaking,
Source: The Japan Federation of Construction Contractors
cement production is one of Japan’s
largest CO2 emitters. In 2014, the country’s annual concrete shipments were around
90 million cubic meters. Since concrete production generates up to 300 kg of CO2
per cubic meter, the annual CO2 emissions were around 27 million tons.
About 60% of these emissions appear during the “calcination” reaction, in which
limestone (CaCO3) is broken down into CO2 and calcium carbonate (CO3) to produce
“clinker”. The rest are energy-related emissions, mainly from the electricity needed to
power the manufacturing process.

As such, the bulk of cement’s decarbonization will be found in applying green
technology to its production process, especially during the firing of limestone.


Targets and achievements
The current targets, as set by the industry, are very
conservative. Progress on both energy efficiency and CO2
reductions has been slow in recent years. After slashing
emissions by roughly 33% from 2000 to 2010, the industry has
done little in the last 10 years to further reduce CO2 levels.
Source: Carbon Brief, Chatham House, via the BBC
Power consumption is also down just 3.7% since 2010.
According to the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, their industry seeks a
40% cut in emissions, over FY2013 levels, possible at some point between the early
2030s and 2040. The net-zero emissions target is FY2050.

Given the slow pace of the industry’s internal change, government is stepping in to
take action. In June, METI listed the country’s top seven emitting sectors and started
to draft a detailed FY2050 decarbonization roadmap for each. Cement was one of the
seven.

As a result, a more ambitious METI plan for decarbonization is expected. While the
numerical targets are not yet known, the drivers for this change are clear: new green
technology for making cement and CCUS.


Re-making cement
One of the most promising new technologies is the “C4S” system developed by
Taiheiyo Cement, Tokyo University, and Hokkaido University with support from
NEDO. The “Calcium Carbonate Circulation System for Construction” aims to make
concrete that can be classified as carbon-neutral.

The technology, which was announced earlier this year, utilizes CO2, concrete waste,
and water to make concrete. The CO2 is captured from the atmosphere and recycled

into calcium carbonate, with concrete waste used to solidify its state. The result is
called CCC (calcium carbonate concrete), which can be used in construction.

Since CCC can be recycled many times over, it not only reduces emissions but also
limits the volume of resources required for cement-making, and also helps with waste
management. The latter in particular is a major issue for Japan, which replaces and
renovates buildings relatively quickly compared to other countries, thus generating
large volumes of concrete and cement waste. Utilizing that waste for new construction
would be a significant business opportunity, as well as a decarbonization solution,
according to NEDO.

If half of Japan’s current concrete production is replaced with CCC, by 2050 the
industry’s annual CO2 emissions could be down by 30 million tons. Furthermore, 6.2
million tons of CO2 could be stored inside construction materials each year.

The private sector leader of the CCC project, Teiheiyo Cement, has pledged to invest
¥100 billion over this current decade to decarbonize the cement sector. The
company’s goal is for its own CO2 emissions to drop 10% by FY2025.

Taiheiyo is also cooperating with businesses outside of the cement sector. For
example, it’s working with JFE Steel and trading house Sojitz to produce calcium
carbonate via carbon capture technology.


Re-making concrete
Another approach is being test by construction major Taisei Corp., which recently
developed a carbon recycling technology known as “T-eConcrete/Carbon-Recycle”.
This captures CO2 emitted during the manufacturing process and uses the by-product
of steel (blast furnace slag) to fix the gas as a carbonate.

Conventional concrete generates up to 300 kg of CO2 per cubic meter of emissions.
Taisei claims that its new technology can capture up to 170 kg of CO2. While the
production process emits some CO2, the net amount is a negative 55 kg of CO2 per
cubic meter thanks to the CO2 fixation process.

Overall, Taisei’s technology promises to cut emissions associated with concrete by
about 80%.


Replacing cement with industrial by-product
Of course, another major advantage of Taisei’s concrete is utilization of materials that
would normally be classed as factory waste.

Rival construction major Obayashi Corp. has taken the idea further and developed the
country’s first commercially available concrete that replaces part of the cement input
with blast furnace slag. The company is marketing the low-carbon product as “Clean-
Crete” (In Japanese: クリーンクリート).

Since “Clean-Crete” is sold as a mixed cement under the JIS standard, it can be
produced in the same way as ordinary concrete and at the same price. The
manufacturing process still emits 100 kg of CO2 per cubic meter, but this is 60% less
than for conventional concrete.

Obayashi has already used the low-carbon material in Japan, including at a waste
treatment center in Miyagi prefecture.

Concrete that uses zero cement
While “Clean-Crete” reduces emissions, a new concrete developed by Okumura Civil
Engineering and Space K. eliminates them almost completely by avoiding cement
altogether.

The companies earlier this year announced a successful test to solidify granulated
furnace slag, the non-metallic by-product of iron-making, and proved that it has the
same strength as concrete. The process mixes granulated slag, steelmaking slag and
blast furnace slag fine powder as a binder. The ingredients are kneaded with seawater
to produce a solidified body.

Okumura’s entirely new material, which is still in the latter stages of testing and will
Source: Nikkei xTECH take time to reach the market, is part of the great drive in materials innovation infusing
the construction sector today.

Given the long timeframe for this breakthrough, the first stages of Japan’s
decarbonization roadmap for the cement industry will most likely rely on low-carbon
rather than zero or even negative carbon materials. Many of the latter are far from a
mass rollout due to manufacturing and cost issues.

The industry is calling on METI and the government to provide incentives for the
wider use of low-carbon cement, which inevitably will initially be used only by the
larger construction firms.

Still, the interaction between steelmaking and the cement industry to reuse waste
from the former, to make clean products for the latter, bodes well for the future of
Japan’s top emitting sectors. It might just be a perfect example of one man’s trash
becoming another man’s treasure.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are 10 important and interesting energy developments from last week as monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices.

Brazil
Enphase Energy, Inc., a leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage
systems, has targeted Brazil’s growing solar industry as a lucrative opportunity.
Starting this month, the company will sell microinverters to residential and small
commercial installers across Brazil. As of July, Brazil had about 10.3 GW of solar, or
about 1.46% of the country's total power capacity, more than double the 2018 level.
Enphase says it has sold 34 million microinverters across the globe, and said they’ve
been adapted to Brazil’s hot tropical climate.

China
An unusually high number of blackouts has hit the country’s northeastern industrial
regions. Demand for Chinese products is rising rapidly as the world recovers from the
Covid pandemic and local factories have dialed up their power needs. However, the
mining of coal has slowed thanks to Beijing’s new rules to transition toward carbon
neutrality by 2060. China relies on coal for more than half of its total energy mix.

El Salvador
The country is harnessing energy from a volcano in order to mine Bitcoin, a pet
project of President Nayib Bukele. While the total amount mined only had a value of
about $269, this was the world’s first successful demonstration of volcano-powered
bitcoin mining. A video on the event had more than 2.3 million views. In June, the
President Bukele said he had instructed the state-owned geothermal electric
company, LaGeo SA de CV to “come up with a plan to offer facilities for Bitcoin
mining with very cheap, 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy from our
volcanos.”

ESG
The global banking industry is reaping record profits from underwriting ESG-related
bond sales, Bloomberg data show. In 2021, banks earned about $3.6 billion in fees
from organizing sales of corporate and state bonds that are instruments of green,
social or sustainable development. That profit is more than double the $1.6 billion
that global banks have made so far this year from issuing debt for fossil-fuel
companies. Last year, a total of about $750 billion of ESG-related bonds were issued,
far surpassing the $468 billion issued in all of 2020.

India
Virescent Infrastructure, a Indian renewable energy platform sponsored by U.S. private
equity firm KKR, set up India’s first renewable energy infrastructure investment trust.
The Virescent Renewable Energy Trust raised INR4.6 billion ($62 million) from a group
of foreign and domestic investors. KKR set up Virescent in October 2020 to acquire
renewable energy assets in India.
LNG

Asian LNG prices hit a record-high on intense global competition for the fuel. The
Japan-Korea Marker benchmark for spot LNG surged to $34.47 per mmbtu. European
gas prices also set records. In the run-up to winter, prices are surging across the globe

as power companies seek to bolster inventories. Meanwhile, other energy sources,
such as coal, are also in short supply. Europe’s energy shortages seem to be driving
the global LNG rally.

Nuclear
Tesla CEO Elon Musk threw his support behind nuclear power, saying he was
"surprised by some of the public sentiment against nuclear…. I’m not saying we
should build a whole bunch of nuclear plants, but I don't think we should shut down
ones that operate safely.” Musk singled out Germany, which now must rely more on
coal-fired power plants after it decommissioned its nuclear power plants.
Nevertheless, Musk added that "large sustainable power-generation developments,
primarily wind and solar” are crucial to meet rising global energy demand.

Oil
The benchmark Brent Crude hit a three-year high, reaching $79.56 in midweek. The
jump in oil prices comes after hurricanes shut down production in the Gulf of Mexico
in the past month. The rally also reflects the economic rebound from the “re-opening”
of many global economies after pandemic-induced restrictions and lockdowns.
Goldman Sachs forecast Brent to trade around $80 to $90 at year-end.

Russia
Natural gas supplies via the country’s Yamal-Europe gas pipeline fell by more than
half, according to data from grid operator Gascade. State-controlled Gazprom,
however, tried to reassure European markets by saying the reduction was temporary.
Flow in the pipeline was down by more than half at one point during the week. Some
European governments complain that Gazprom is weaponizing gas deliveries to exert
pressure on EU countries.

UK
The government committed a major U-turn and re-opened the visa process on a
temporary basis for overseas truck drivers as a shortage of gasoline threatened to
bring the world's fifth largest economy to a halt. Hundreds of army troops are also
being trained urgently to drive trucks to alleviate a shortage of both fuel and food and
other supplies around the country. In the last week of September, many gasoline
stations nationwide closed due to fuel shortages, which sparks panic buying and long
lines at service stations. Major oil companies said there was no shortage of the fuel in
the UK but claimed they did not have enough drivers to make the deliveries.
