NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





JERA launches global renewables firm based in London, sets 20 GW goal by 2035

(Company statement, April 15)
•  Japan’s largest power company, JERA, has launched a global renewables subsidiary, JERA Nex,
with its HQ in London.
•  The news came with JERA’s announcement of its new goal to develop 20 GW of renewable power
generation capacity globally by FY2035.
•  JERA Nex will develop, invest in and operate a range of renewable energy assets, including
offshore and onshore wind, solar power and battery energy storage systems.

•  CONTEXT: In 2023, JERA acquired Belgium-based offshore wind developer Parkwind in a €1.55
billion deal, boosting its total renewable installed power capacity to 3 GW. Parkwind operates
across north Europe and even in New Zealand, and is now a major player in Norway’s growing
offshore wind sector. JERA Nex will take over the majority of the group’s assets and 10 GW
development pipeline.
• TAKEAWAY: JERA was started as a collection of ‘cast-off’ coal and gas-fired power assets of TEPCO and
Chubu Electric. It was created partly to help TEPCO separate its thermal fleet from the liabilities of the

Fukushima disaster, but also with the idea that the parent companies would have more scope to focus on
other, cleaner forms of energy. And yet, less than a decade since its founding, it is JERA that is moving
aggressively into clean energy (without abandoning its coal and gas plants). TEPCO and Chubu Electric’s
forays into renewables, nuclear and other forms of clean energy sources have been far less pronounced.

Over the past few years, JERA has forged partnerships with a number of leading energy companies in allied

nations in North America and Europe, as well as in India and Southeast Asia; cooperating in a wide range of
clean energy activities that hold the most potential, ranging from ammonia production to offshore wind.

For Japan to claim that it’s among the leaders of the decarbonization movement, it needs its top power
companies to have global scale and global clout. JERA is making a claim that it can play that role better than
the utilities that seeded it.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JERA, India’s ReNew ink 100,000 tons / year green ammonia deal
(Company statement, April 19)
o  JERA and India’s ReNew E-Fuels Private Ltd inked a deal to produce 100,000 tons / year

of green ammonia in the Odisha state of India. All production will supply JERA.
o  Renewable power supplies of almost 500 MW will be utilized to produce hydrogen and
convert it into ammonia.
o  CONTEXT: ReNew is one of India’s leading decarbonization solutions companies, with a
clean energy generation capacity portfolio of over 13.5 GW.

MLIT revises guidelines for climate-related financial disclosures in real estate sector
(Nikkan Real Estate Economic News, April 15)
•  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has revised guidance for
handling the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in the real estate sector.
•  The guidance contains real-life examples of information disclosure by Tokyu Fudosan, Mitsubishi

Estate, Tokyo Tatemono, and other large real estate developers.
•  CONTEXT: In 2017, the TCFD first released climate-related financial disclosure recommendations
designed to help companies provide better information to support market transparency and more
informed capital allocation.




Academics urge Paris Agreement exit strategy, depending on U.S. elections results
(Group statement, April 16)
•  16 academics on energy issues have written a Seventh Basic Energy Plan- Non-government version
that cited the need for a Paris Agreement exit strategy depending on the outcome of the U.S.
presidential election.

•  The group urges a bilateral pact, with the U.S. addressing energy and economic security, making
this a basis for building a post-Paris global framework.
•  The paper urges re-assessment of climate change impact, as not all weather and environmental
phenomena are directly caused by global warming.
•  CONTEXT: The authors are on the extreme opposites of the opinion leaders associated with the
Renewable Energy Institute, which recently has been attacked for allegedly misleading policy
discussions. The group is led by Sugiyama Taishi, Research Director of the Canon Institute for

Global Studies.
• TAKEAWAY: Debates will become more colorful as various political forces become more assertive. This year,
METI will publish the Seventh Basic Energy Plan that outlines policy directions based on long-term outlook,
updated every three years. As gaps between the Sixth Plan and reality widen, the next version will include new
goals and reset directions. For example, Nikkei reported the next plan will include a 2035 national target to cut
emissions by 66% from 2013, and a 2040 energy mix scenario.




MoE includes CO2 removal by concrete in 2022 report: a world first

(Government statement, April 12)
•  The MoE reported 17 tons of CO2 were removed by four concrete products in its 2022 GHG
inventory report to the UN, a world first.
•  The concretes were: CO2-SUICOM that absorbed CO2; SUSMICS-C containing biochar; and T-
eConcrete and Clean-Crete N that used industrial wastes as feed.
•  The MoE also reported 350,000 tons of carbon removals by seagrass meadows and macroalgal

beds, also a world first. The govt is studying adding salt and tidal marshes to blue carbon
resources.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The net GHG release, factoring in the removals that totaled 50 billion tons, was 1.085 billion tons
of CO2 equivalent, down 22.9% from 2013. The period under review ran from April 2022 to March
2023.
• TAKEAWAY: The MoE says the figures show that the country is on track with its 2030 goal of a 46% GHG
reduction. However, the shift away from fossil fuels is still the core net zero solution and the govt needs to

show how it is reinforcing this pathway or how other approaches can work at scale.

Kawasaki Heavy begins work on 8 MW hydrogen co-fired generator
(Japan NRG, April 15)
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) began building a 8 MW power generator fueled by 30% hydrogen
and 70% city gas at its Kobe facility. It will start in October.
•  The facility’s legacy 7.5 MW generator that runs on city gas will be converted to accommodate

hydrogen. Commercial grade hydrogen for FCVs will be used, rather than the high purity liquefied
hydrogen the company imports.
•  CONTEXT: In 2023, KHI sold and delivered a 8 MW generator to Nisshin Oilio Group, but plans
call for it to launch in April 2025. KHI aims to boost its hydrogen-gas co-firing experience.
• TAKEAWAY: In theory, these KHI generators accommodate 100% hydrogen firing, but technical skills are
required to successfully and safely run them. The next milestone is to run a fully hydrogen-fueled 30 MW

system this year at its affiliate RWE Generation in Germany.

KEPCO’s electricity generation from nuclear in FY2024 expected to be highest since 2011

(Company statement)
•  KEPCO released its NPP maintenance and operation plan for FY2024. The total electricity
generated is expected to increase by 10.9% over FY2023 levels, reaching 49 billion KWh.
•  The utilization rate of NPPs is expected to increase by about 8.4 percentage points over FY2023 to
about 85%. This will likely lead to lower generation costs.
•  CONTEXT: All of KEPCO's seven nuclear units are now operating. The Kansai region is Japan's
second-largest industrial area and second most populated. Before the 2011 Fukushima nuclear

disaster, the region's 11 nuclear reactors supplied almost 50% of the region's power.
• TAKEAWAY: The amount of electricity that these seven units will generate in FY2024 will likely be the highest
since 2011 when the country’s nuclear fleet was shut down following the Tohoku earthquake and Fukushima
disaster. Importantly, higher utilization rates will likely help KEPCO cut their operating costs and lead to lower
electricity prices in the region. That can be used by nuclear proponents to argue for more reactor restarts in
other regions.





EEX adds TTF and JKM gas derivatives to LNG futures to mitigate price risk
(Japan NRG, April 15)
•  EEX added new futures products related to natural gas and LNG. It now trades Dutch TTF futures
and JKM, the LNG spot index for Asia.
•  These products can be traded up to six years in advance, allowing Japanese LNG buyers to hedge

against price volatility risk. The standard trading unit for both is 10,000 MMBTU.
•  The average monthly price of JKM futures is calculated based on daily valuations provided by
Platts (Japan / Korea Marker). For TTF futures, the final settlement price is converted into USD on
the basis of the euro-denominated price.
•  Also, with the addition, the spark spread (the difference between the price for procurement of
natural gas and the market price of electricity) can now be fixed by combining it with Japanese

electricity futures already available on the EEX.
•  CONTEXT: The decision about the addition was made amid growing demand, and in response to
calls to mitigate the risk of LNG price volatility in power and gas markets in Japan and elsewhere
due to natural gas supply uncertainty.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
How Japanese steel is turning green

Part I : A Blast from the Past
The government has great expectations for the steel sector – perhaps the greatest of
all industries in Japan. And it’s putting money behind those expectations. Domestic
steel firms are set to receive the biggest slice of state R&D financing for clean tech: At
least 20% of the entire Green Innovation Fund.

As the top industrial emitter, the steel sector could make the biggest difference in the
country’s efforts to meet CO2 emission reduction goals. But that’s not all. Steel is
often defined as one of the four pillars of modern civilization. Changing the way steel
is made could drive a shift in a number of other industries and, the government
hopes, deliver on economic growth in the net zero era.

So far, details on how the sector has responded to the challenge of revamping almost
its entire manufacturing and supply chain have been scant. There is a widely
mentioned government target for Japan to forge 10 million tons of “green steel” by
2030, but little explanation around how that label will be applied and what is needed
to achieve it.


Based on some recent demonstration projects by Japanese steel firms, and analysis of
corporate actions and strategies, Japan NRG has put together a roadmap for the
sector, noting what the companies say they require to transition to new technologies
and what the bottlenecks may be. Our conclusion is that the government targets are
possible, but the conditions required are far from straightforward.

This is the first of a two-part series that delves into “green steel” in Japan.

Worst emitter after electricity generation
In FY2022, the Japanese steel sector emitted 113.8 million tons of CO2 and produced
83.5 million tons of steel. That is 11% of the nation’s emissions of 1,031 million tons,
the largest share after the electricity sector. The figures do not include methane and
other GHGs.

The biggest reason for emissions in steelmaking is the use of coking coal, which is
used in a process known as “reduction” because it removes oxygen from iron ore.
This causes 80% of steelmaking’s carbon footprint because as the coal is heated, it
releases gases including carbon oxides. In a blast furnace, the gases combine to strip
away oxygen from the metallic iron.

As it reacts with oxygen, carbon also releases heat, which melts the iron into a
material known as “pig iron”. This takes place in a blast furnace that runs at 900-
1,800°C. Next, the pig iron is placed in a rotating furnace to remove silicon, sulfur and
phosphorus, before the metal is rolled and shaped into bars, plates and sheets.

This is the process that most of Japan’s steelmakers deploy, but there is an alternative
technology to blast furnaces. About 23% of Japanese steel is produced by recycling

steel in electric furnaces, which releases half the carbon of a blast furnace. The process
required high electricity input, but this isn’t the only challenge. While recycling rates in
Japan are high, there isn’t enough scrap to replace iron ore.

Scope 1 emissions from a blast furnace are 1.2 tons per ton of steel. Including
emissions from iron ore and coal shipping, as well as the pre-treatment of iron ore
(called sintering) needed before it can be added to the blast furnace, the Scope 1 and
2 emissions of one ton of steel comes to around 2 tons of CO2 equivalent.

Low hanging fruit
Like the other industries, Japanese steelmakers first looked to reduce emissions by
improving the existing processes using legacy infrastructure. The companies are
exploring the possibility of replacing some coal gases with zero-emission hydrogen,
and connecting a carbon capture and separation unit to blast furnaces.

Hydrogen as a replacement for coal was a natural choice as the sector’s top players
Nippon Steel, Nisshin Steel (now part of Nippon Steel), JFE Steel and Kobe Steel have
already spent many years researching new iron reduction technologies using
hydrogen or hydrogen-rich natural gas. Some of the R&D goes back more than 20
years, before climate concerns became the global issue that they are today.

The companies were originally driven by the need to diversify feedstock supply
sources and to create more flexibility around their technologies. In 2020, these studies
were elevated to the status of national projects with state funding, and were dubbed
the “CO2 Ultimate Reduction System for Cool Earth 2050” (Course50).


With closer government involvement, there was a push to set more concrete targets.
One of the key goals for the Course50 program was to oversee a 30% reduction in
emissions in blast furnaces. METI pushed for this to occur by 2030 with the
commercialization of techniques that would replace part of the coal gases volume with
hydrogen (leading to a 10% CO2 cut) and by installing a carbon separation unit (20%
reduction).

This initial limit on hydrogen input – the 10% cap – was decided for technological
reasons rather than price considerations. Inside a blast furnace, hydrogen absorbs
heat rather than maintaining it like carbon oxides. This requires higher furnace
temperatures to compensate and can affect the quality of pig iron production.

Next step
The initial Course50 program is supposed to evolve in time to adapt to a higher
hydrogen input. At the stage Super Course50, the idea is to have hydrogen both
replace some coal gases in the blast furnace (10%) and at other stages of the
manufacturing process inside the steel plant (10%), combining for a 20% emissions
reduction. This stage requires more hydrogen supplies to be available and assumes
that total emissions could be cut by 50% from present levels.

All these numbers seemed speculative given the lengthy R&D process to date and
lack of visible results, but in February this year Nippon Steel announced an
encouraging breakthrough. The nation’s top steel producer said that it had managed
to install and test a Super Course50 process at its Kimitsu Works in Chiba Prefecture

over the last two months of 2023. It ran a test at a 12 m3, 34/ day capacity pilot line in
the factory and recorded a 33% cut in emissions compared with the regular blast
furnace process.

Technologies to reduce CO2 emissions | COURSE50 | The Japan Iron and Steel Federation













The pilot line was connected to a carbon capture and separation unit with a 30 ton /
day capacity. According to the company, this was a world record for the size of CO2
reduction achieved in a blast furnace. It cited factors such as better heat management
and improved air flow control in the furnace.


In short, Nippon Steel heated hydrogen to the point at which it still performed the
role of separating the metal core from the oxygen without losing control of the
process.

Time will tell
Based on this success, Japanese steel-makers believe they can now move onto the
next stage of the technological shift. Their target is a 50% reduction in emissions at a
bigger-sized furnace. The deadline: commercial operations of the technology by
2040.

The timelines don’t gel with the government’s 2030 emission reductions. But if the
companies were able to accelerate their actions, or the government subsidized their
technological shift so that it took place before it was deemed commercially viable,
then we believe the following scenario would be required.

At least two and likely three or more steelmaking units in Japan would need to shift to
the Super Course50 technology by 2030, and at least two DRI shaft furnaces would
need to make the switch also.

Details on this, and the cost-side of the equation, will be in the second part of this
series.

ANALYSIS

BY MAGDALENA OSUMI
Market Players Call on METI to Induce Capacity Market Toward Renewables

Recent changes in Japan's energy trading sector have drawn a strong response from
major players who are now calling on the government to make the market more
suitable for renewable energy sources.

In response to METI’s review of current electricity trading platforms, these major
players have told the ministry to either scrap the capacity market or revise it in a way
that will stimulate the construction of clean energy generation.

The purpose of METI’s review is to find ways to amend and improve existing markets
by synchronizing some of the platforms. In one step towards electricity market
optimization, the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) proposed a
bidding system in which electricity supply (spot market) and adjustment (balancing
market) are simultaneously contracted. The proposal is based on the British nodal
scheme adopted in 2022 under which prices are determined on a node-by-node
basis, taking into account grid congestion.

Another model that METI is also considering is a “Three-Part Offer” that takes into
consideration three key factors in securing electricity in the market: availability of
capacity; availability of volume; and the cost and time involved in acquiring this
electricity so that it’s at hand and ready to be consumed. To some extent, this model
mirrors the North American PJM and NYISO mechanisms.


While discussions on market reform continue, METI’s website contains a selection of
comments from market players on its revision plan; albeit the comments were made
anonymously, and there are also responses to those comments.

One view echoed by a number of market players was that the current main capacity
market appears to be well suited to preserving the operations of existing thermal
power plants, and does little to stimulate building new renewables capacity. Such an
opinion goes on to say that this fails to meet Japan’s objective of marching towards
2050 net zero goals and to increase the share of green electricity in the national
energy mix.

Such a view reflects concerns that were raised by the Organization for Cross-regional
Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO) which in its major report in 2020
stressed that: “In the wholesale energy markets, rules must account for the variable
availability of renewable resources and the distinct properties of storage and demand
response resources.”

The report summarized discussions on development of the capacity market and
stressed that it should be open to all energy resources. It also added, however, that:
“Capacity market rules now must reflect the actual ability of these new resources to
contribute to system reliability.”

Market participant feedback also included suggestions to reduce bid capacity for the
main auction, to ban power sources that are 11 years or older from participating, and
to increase the amount of credits tied to the FIT system.

They pointed out that bidding capacity is 15-16% more than the maximum power
capacity, which includes factors such as severe weather response, contingent supply
and demand fluctuations and additional capacity. In other words, the bidding capacity
duplicates the role that should be performed in the supply-demand adjustment
markets, creating a situation in which participating power sources are unable to
function effectively in any of those.

The respondents suggested introducing ways to favor renewables in the main capacity
auction, saying that the recently introduced Long-Term Decarbonization Capacity
Power Source Auction, which was designed to promote investment in new power
sources, is still flawed.

The new Auction is supposed to include non-FIT/FIP renewables and batteries, as well
as other energy storage systems such as pumped hydro. However, when the first
FY2023 Long-Term Decarbonization Power Source Auction was launched in January,
of the 4 GW on offer, batteries and pumped hydro energy storage options were
capped at 1 GW. Meanwhile, the Auction is open to LNG-fired capacity if it vows to
replace dirtier coal-fired generation. Thus, contrary to the industry members’
expectations, the market structure has become more supportive of existing power
sources.

What’s more, market players have told METI that the main auction's benchmark price
(Net-CONE) has remained unchanged, based on the assumption of 40 years of gas
combined cycle thermal (CCGT) operation. They requested that the government
review whether the capacity market is consistent with the system’s original intent.


“The capacity market is not a solution to global warming, as it supports old fossil fuel-
fired power generation,” said one comment.

Before the launch of the Long-Term Decarbonization Power Source Auction, industry
players had high hopes that it would be a game changer for BESS. However, the
public feedback revealed growing concerns that under the new auction system much
of the cost burden could fall on new power market entrants while favoring incumbents
such as the EPCOs.

Feedback to METI asked the ministry to re-examine the scheme to ensure fair access
to power sources so that new power companies are not forced to pay capacity
contributions that include those power sources to which they don’t have access.

METI responded to the comments by saying that the purpose of the capacity market
is mainly to secure power supply in advance, and also to support new investment in
power facilities. The ministry said it believes that this objective should help secure
"the necessary adjustment capacity for the mass introduction of renewable energy."

METI’s main goal is to foster a market mechanism that will stabilize business
operations in the power sector, and, therefore, electricity prices. Achieving that goal

still requires much work, and so METI has vowed to continue its review of the market
systems and to address what has been pointed out as significant flaws that are in need
of solutions.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / BESS
Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners began building the first stage of a 250 MW / two-
hour battery energy storage system (BESS) in Queensland; it invested around A$325
mln in the project that’s part of a A$2.5 billion battery and data center facility at South
Pine.

China / Clean energy goods
U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen said China's investments in manufacturing of clean
energy goods creates an unfair playing field that puts U.S. businesses at risk. And
from a supply chain standpoint, she “thinks it creates risks that we're clearly seeking to
mitigate”.

Data centers
By 2030, the world’s data centers are expected to use more electricity than India. AI’s
voracious need for computing power is threatening to overwhelm energy sources,
said Arm Holdings CEO Rene Haas, adding that a solution must be found.

Energy Transition
High interest rates will “disproportionately affect” renewables, nuclear power and new
technologies, and could slow the energy transition, reports Wood Mackenzie. In
contrast, companies in the metals, oil and gas sectors will be less impacted due to
their low gearing.

Indonesia / Oil
Shares of Indonesia Energy Corp surged more than 100% last week, but then
dropped, though still trading above the April 11 mark of $2.74. On April 15, shares
surged to $6.08, settling at $5.26 on April 20. These movements reflect growing
concern that the price of oil might skyrocket if there’s a major war in the Middle East.

Malaysia / Electricity markets
The govt approved establishment of Energy Exchange Malaysia (Enegem) to facilitate
the sale of renewable electricity to neighboring countries. An auction will begin with a
pilot run of 100 MW, utilizing the existing interconnection between Singapore and
Malaysia.

SE Asia / Energy transition
Southeast Asia is "woefully off track" on green investments to reduce emissions, and
needs new policies and financial mechanisms to bridge the gap, said consultancy
Bain. While green investment grew 20% last year, it falls short of the $1.5 trillion
required this decade.

Thailand / EV batteries
Two major EV battery producers in China are showing interest in producing power
cells in Thailand, with a possible combined first phase investment at over 30 billion

baht, said the Board of Investment. Thailand has attracted significant foreign
investment in EV production.

Vietnam / Energy transition
Vietnam and Australia agreed to collaborate on climate and energy development to
boost sustainability. Australia also committed A$105 mln to support development in
sustainable infrastructure in Vietnam, with a focus on clean energy.
