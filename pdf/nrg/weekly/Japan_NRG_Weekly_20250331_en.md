NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


ANRE, OCCTO list issues to tackle to build simultaneous market system

(Government statement, March 24)
•  ANRE and OCCTO experts discussed issues for creating a simultaneous market:
o  For the seller side, the issues are: How to bid with self-scheduled power sources (where the
plant operator determines the start of the power source by themselves); What mechanism
to use when self-scheduled power source bids are restricted; How to register operating
parameters; How to bid for power sources other than thermal power; and, How to operate
power sources that require one week (or, at least more than one day) to bring online.
o  For the buyer side, the issues are: The bid process; and bidding obligation for demand
that’s linked to bilateral contracts.
o  In terms of power supply security, the issue is how to respond in the event that demand
differs from TSO expectations.
o  Regarding methods for calculating market prices: There are questions around the price per
kWh in a situation when there is grid congestion; how to determine the price per Δ (delta)
kW; and How to set individual compensation for power generation costs (uplift).
o  In terms of the intraday part of the simultaneous market, the issues are timing and
frequency of holding the market, the settlement target, and how to change bidding
content.
o  For actual supply-demand, the debates are around how to set the price of balancing power
per kWh and the imbalance charge.
•  To introduce a simultaneous market, the roles of the operating entities will need to be clarified, and
a system will need to be established to ensure that they work together.
•  Next, the govt study group intends to confirm the current operations and management of JEPX,
EPRX and OCCTO, paying particular attention to functions and operations utilized in market
management, as well as mechanisms used for information exchange with related organizations.
• TAKEAWAY: The Study Group on the Simultaneous Market is charged with finding a way to introduce such a
market in Japan. The group has met 12 times since February 2023, and it published an interim report on initial
findings in November 2024. For a detailed look at the Simultaneous Market discussions and implications, please
see this week’s Analysis section.



Govt launches meeting on Watt-Bit Coordination

(Government statement, March 21)
•  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication (MIC) and METI launched a new body, known
as the Public-Private Meeting on Watt-Bit Coordination. It brings together members of the power,
telecom and data center (DC) industries.
•  The govt wants to accelerate the digital transformation (DX) in the country through the rollout of
AI, and promote coordination between the electricity and telecom sectors (the Watt-Bit
Coordination) with upgraded infrastructure in order to achieve growth, decarbonization and
national resilience.
•  Working groups will be held and a summary will be produced in June after four monthly meetings
for technical and practical discussions.
•  CONTEXT: MIC and METI held “Expert Meetings on Development of Digital Infrastructure (DC, etc.)”,
and published an interim report on findings in October 2024. It indicated the need for urgent measures
to develop digital infrastructure. The GX2040 Vision, approved by the Cabinet in February, underscored

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

the importance of effective coordination between electricity and telecoms to build infrastructure to
achieve rapid development of data centers, which require lots of electricity.
• TAKEAWAY: As ordered by PM Ishiba to both ministers at the Digital Government and Finance Reform Council
on Feb 20, there is a government push to integrate the development of power and telecom infrastructure. The
urgency can be seen from how quickly this initiative is moving. From a first meeting in March, the group is
expected to deliver a detailed roadmap for future efforts within three months. This suggests there is already a
consensus about which direction policy needs to move in to facilitate inter-sector collaboration.



ANRE resumes discussions of measures to promote biodiesel
(Government statement, March 25)
•  ANRE listed key issues for introducing biodiesel, and proposed measures.
•  Japan’s maximum blending ratio of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) in diesel to create biodiesel for
trucks, buses and other vehicles is currently 5% (B5). This will be increased to the same level as in
Europe, 7% (B7).
•  The fuel for construction machinery, etc, is also limited to B5, but following the examples of Europe
and the U.S., a new JIS standard for B20 and B30 fuel exclusively for off-road use will be
formulated so that it can be introduced in Japan.
•  Modern-day biodiesel with HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) has the same chemical formula as

diesel fuel, but Japan has not as yet established a standard for its handling.
•  Since HVO has a lower density than existing fossil-based diesel, it does not fall under the definition
of ‘diesel’ for the purposes of diesel tax. So, regulations and operation of the tax on diesel will be
reviewed.
•  CONTEXT: There is growing momentum towards using biodiesel for construction machinery and as a
marine fuel to cut emissions. In addition to demos of high blends of biodiesel, the govt is also promoting
biodiesel as part of national policy. The 7th Basic Energy Plan states that biodiesel should be prioritized
in transportation. However, issues such as standards and taxation have hindered its spread so far.
• TAKEAWAY: As when blending bioethanol with gasoline, discussions about blending biodiesel with diesel began
about 20 years ago. It has yet to become widespread due to cost, supply volumes, and product standards. In the
past few years, the government has put more priority on supporting hydrogen and ammonia as low carbon
fuels, but recent moves show that biofuels are back in favor.



Japan asset managers start to exit financial net-zero alliance
(Nikkei Asia, March 27)
•  Tokio Marine Asset Management left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative formed by leading
financial industry players to tackle climate change.
•  CONTEXT: This exit begins the outward trickle of Japanese asset management companies, following
banks and insurance companies. Most U.S. banks and insurers have also quit NZAM. The world’s
largest asset manager, Blackrock, left in January.
• TAKEAWAY: These exits were on the cards as soon as Trump called for the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris
Agreement, again. Most financial companies that have left NZAM plan to continue with climate and
sustainability policies independently. NZAM’s implosion creates an opportunity for new frameworks to emerge,
possibly centered on Europe.

NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


JERA acquires EDF Trading’s Tokyo desk to expand in Japan’s power trading

(Company statement, March 27)
•  EDF Trading and JERA Global Markets will merge operations in Japanese power trading. JERA GM
will effectively take over the Tokyo desk of EDF Trading.
•  CONTEXT: EDF Trading has built up one of the biggest power trading desks in Japan. JERA GM is a JV
between JERA (two-thirds owner) and EDF Trading (the rest), and focuses on trading in fuels.
•  The two companies launched cooperation in 2008, when EDF Trading was a counterparty with
Chubu Electric on coal procurement. (JERA is a 50-50 JV between Chubu Electric and TEPCO).
•  The integration of the two trading desks takes effect from April 1, 2025. JERA GM will continue to
operate out of the Coredo Nihonbashi building in Tokyo with an expanded team of over 50 staff.
• TAKEAWAY: JERA is the world’s largest LNG importer, but in the last couple of years it has also tried to expand
into international gas trading that’s not directly linked with the fuel needs of its power plants. JERA has a
Singapore office to bolster its global LNG trading while also dipping its toes into the electricity markets at
home. The addition of EDF Trading expands JERA’s resources considerably and should help make it a top player
in Japan’s fast-growing power derivatives markets.



JERA seeks to supply gas-fired power for data centers
(Nikkei Business, March 27)
•  JERA plans to enter the data center market by constructing gas-fired power plants near data
centers, or by attracting data centers next to its existing facilities, providing rapid and stable
electricity supply through on-site PPAs.
•  CONTEXT: Rising demand from IT firms competing in generative AI development has accelerated the
expansion of data centers. However, the volume of renewable energy in development lags behind,
pushing operators to explore other ways to secure electricity. This is where generators of gas-fired power
plants hope to come in, knowing that the availability of electricity from nuclear plants in Japan is
limited.

•  Gas-fired generation supplies 35% of Japan’s electricity, with JERA responsible for roughly 30% of
the nation's total generation. JERA operates gas-fired plants at 26 locations, mostly around urban
areas.
• TAKEAWAY: The lack of available power for new data centers is starting to push U.S. operators to review other
options. Just a few months ago, ExxonMobil said it will design large (1.5 GW or more) gas-fired power plants
specifically to serve data centers in the U.S. JERA seems to be the first Japanese company to test interest for
similar applications here.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
NYK to begin experiment in Yokohama for offshore data center
(Company statement, March 27)
o  NYK will begin an experiment in Yokohama in autumn to develop an offshore data center
powered by renewable energy. A test facility will operate on stored battery power,
examining potential issues such as salt damage.
o  CONTEXT: NYK, Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, NTT Facilities, Eurus Energy Holdings, and Yokohama
City are partners on the project that calls for a container-type data center with solar panels
and batteries on a floating mooring facility.

Editorial: TEPCO must rewrite path to reconstruction

(Nikkei, March 23)
•  CONTEXT: This is an editorial from Nikkei.
•  TEPCO held up publication of its revised business reconstruction plan for FY2024 over delays in
restarting Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP. The restart is essential for improving TEPCO finances, but local
approval is uncertain.
•  The utility faces rising costs from the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup, with the total now at ¥23.4
trillion, up from an initial estimate of ¥6 trillion. Despite plans to have two Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
reactors operating, safety issues caused delays.

6



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  TEPCO expects a loss of ¥520 billion by March 2025, its seventh consecutive year of losses. TEPCO’s
fifth business plan must focus on accelerating the plant's restart, and aim to improve public trust
and profitability through restructuring.
•  In a provisional update, TEPCO requested an extra ¥1.9 trillion in state aid to cover rising costs.
TEPCO’s reliance on public funds continues to grow, raising concerns about the financial burden on
taxpayers.
•  TEPCO’s attempts at business restructuring and attracting capital have had limited success. The
only significant achievement has been JERA. Other efforts to diversify and strengthen revenue have
fallen short. To regain financial stability, TEPCO must not only restart Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, but
reduce dependence on nuclear power and state support.



OCCTO  reports on status of FY2025 supply plan
(Agency statement, March 19)
•  OCCTO reported its outlook for power supply in FY2025 (and through FY2034); this includes
assumptions around impact of severe weather on supply and demand and the influence of reserve
margins on balancing.
•  OCCTO says that demand for electricity should continue to increase through FY2034, due to
economic growth, and new data centers and semiconductor factories; their impact is expected to be
greater than the impact of population decline and energy conservation measures.
•  In terms of the supply-demand balance, there’ll be years when supply reliability is not certain in
some areas, which will require measures such as additional capacity market auctions and
adjustments to the timing of power plant repairs.

•  As far as balancing capacity, OCCTO sees annual fluctuations due to the retirement, as well as
construction, of thermal power plants; but, overall the balance is expected to remain at FY2024
levels. Also, the power mix of coal, LNG-fired thermal power and pumped storage power is
expected to stay largely unchanged.
•  In response to robust summer and winter demand, OCCTO expects to secure the minimum required
reserve rate of 3% in all areas, taking into account increased supply from thermal power, inter-
regional volumes, and dispatchable power sources during periods of high demand.
•  The agency expects few changes in supply-demand management in the context of the reserve
margins as they stand.
•  CONTEXT: Each March, OCCTO publishes the “Supply Plan” in its annual report.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
OCCTO to prepare long-term policy for cross-regional grid
(Agency statement, March 21)
o  With a view to formulating the third long-term cross-regional grid system policy, OCCTO
will examine the following issues:
▪  Review of long-term outlook for cross-regional grid development
▪  Update guidelines for renewal of aging facilities
▪  Evaluate and implement renewals of interconnection facilities
▪  Study congestion management on trunk and local grids (with an eye on the future needs of a
simultaneous market)
o  These discussions will be in tandem with ANRE, EGC and TSOs; not just OCCTO.
o  CONTEXT: OCCTO has formulated the “Long-term Policy for the Cross-regional Grid System”
for the development and renewal of the nationwide grid systems. This includes the ideal state
of the nationwide grid systems over a 10-year period and how to achieve it. The first version
dates to March 2017; it was reviewed in March 2023. It now must be rethought in light of
recent changes, such as the 7th Basic Energy Plan.

•  Japan and South Korea held the 2nd Hydrogen and Ammonia Cooperation Dialogue on March 26 in
Tokyo, agreeing to deepen collaboration in supply chains, certification, international standards, and
safety.
•  The countries will establish a Japan-Korea platform led by private organizations to promote
hydrogen and ammonia supply chain development and utilization.



Cosmo Energy, Shizuoka Univ study green hydrogen by seawater electrolysis
(Company statement, March 26)
•  Cosmo Energy Holdings and Shizuoka University began a joint study of green hydrogen production
using seawater electrolysis.
•  If successful, the project could produce green hydrogen at less cost.
•  CONTEXT: Cosmo Energy is working to develop CCS and CCU. The company uses large amounts of
seawater in oil refining and has seawater pumping facilities. Shizuoka University has developed and
patented technology for producing hydrogen by electrolyzing seawater.
• TAKEAWAY: Seawater electrolysis is a process where electricity is used to decompose seawater (H2O +
dissolved salts) into its constituent elements: hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). Using seawater could be a boon

because of the abundance of the resource as compared to limited freshwater resources, but corrosion from salty
water has prevented this development to date. Still, the need for switching to seawater has been questioned by
many sources due to the additional costs involved, the additional energy use, and other challenges.

procurement.



ANRE: control functions of home storage batteries to support DR

(Government statement, March 21)
•  ANRE proposed control functions for home storage batteries that would support demand response
(DR).
•  For communication, an appliance will be able to link with the gateway in the same way as a heat
pump, and with the DR server using a structured data format.
•  For external control functions, the DR server will be able to issue charge/ discharge commands with
target values and durations for power to the appliance, as well as monitoring the amount of charge,
and returning the appliance to its own mode after DR control. The server would also monitor the
amount of power needed for backup.
•  As with heat pumps, the appliance must pass security requirements and be on the labeling system
(JC-STAR).

10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The “DRready Study Group” was launched in June 2024 to examine the DR requirements
for equipment and appliances. Because DR requirements vary by each appliance, discussions began with
heat pump water heaters, which are expected to become more prevalent and consume large amounts of
electricity.



JR Kyushu leads initiative to tackle abandoned small solar plants
(Company statement, March 25)
•  JR Kyushu, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Bank, Fuyo General Lease, and Girasol Energy have launched
"Hyakunen Solar Kyushu," a business initiative aimed at acquiring and consolidating small to
medium-sized solar power plants in Kyushu to ensure their stable, long-term operation and address
abandonment risks.
•  Hyakunen Solar Kyushu plans to acquire 10 MW of solar power capacity in the Kyushu region by
2027.
•  The project will be funded with investments from the four companies, alongside financing from
regional banks such as Higo Bank.
•  CONTEXT: Small and medium-sized solar power plants, with a capacity of less than 1 MW, account for
90% of Japan’s total, but there are concerns that they will be abandoned after the 20-year FIT period
expires.



Japan mulls 12-hour daily limit for battery charging to ease grid integration
(IT Media, March 20)
•  CONTEXT: The govt is discussing how to speed up connection of more energy storage batteries to the
grid. There is concern that adding a lot of new battery capacity at once could destabilize the energy
system’s flow.
•  One idea is a standard daily maximum for charging, at 12 hours nationwide. Operators that agree
would then see their grid applications processed faster.
•  Under the proposed guidelines, battery storage operators subject to these restrictions would retain
eligibility to participate in capacity and balancing markets, although failure to meet market
requirements due to charging restrictions won’t exempt operators from penalties.
•  Grid operators in turn will be asked to provide, in advance, battery storage developers with detailed
hourly grid-flow data, enabling accurate assessments of potential charging limitations before
finalizing connection agreements.
• TAKEAWAY: METI is reviewing a number of strategies that would give grid operators leeway with how they
treat BESS in times of network congestion. These include the use of “non-firm” contracts through which battery
facility operators agree to restrictions on charging at times of grid congestion. METI wants to avoid making
restrictions excessive, otherwise BESS won’t be able to play its role in balancing the market. However, officials
also seem keen to retain a degree of control, especially over peak periods. Where BESS facilities are unable to
meet their obligations in the capacity / balancing markets explicitly due to grid issues, the onus may fall on the
grid operator to invest in network upgrades.



Smart Energy enters battery maintenance business

HEPCO plans to restart Tomari NPP 1-2

(Nikkei, March 26)
•  Hokkaido Electric (HEPCO) revealed plans to restart Tomari NPP Units 1 and 2 in the early 2030s.
By FY2035, HEPCO aims to achieve an operating profit of over ¥90 billion. If the restarts go
forward then HEPCO expects electricity rate reductions.
•  As for Unit 3, HEPCO completed the explanations for regulatory approval, and it expects approval
within the year, aiming to restart Unit 3 in early 2027.
•  HEPCO also announced its investment strategy through FY2035. It will allocate ¥400 billion over
the next decade for carbon-neutral initiatives. It will allocate ¥250 billion for next-gen energy
sources like hydrogen and ammonia.
•  CONTEXT: The combined capacity of Tomari Units 1,2,3 is 2.07 GW; they covered over 40% of
Hokkaido’s electricity demand before the Fukushima accident. Since then, all units have been offline. By
FY2035, HEPCO plans for nuclear power to account for 60–70% of its energy mix.
• TAKEAWAY: As TEPCO’s example shows, nothing can be taken for granted in these plans for nuclear reactor
restarts. HEPCO’s numbers look promising and could make it one of the most valuable power utilities in the
country (see this week’s Analysis section for more details), but the company’s applications for a restart of
Tomari NPP have been repelled by the regulator multiple times. As covered in previous Analysis texts by Japan
NRG, no nuclear reactor restarts are likely within the next two years. HEPCO’s early 2027 guidance seems
overly optimistic.

METI eyes competitive bidding for CCS transport and storage
(Government statement, March 28)
•  The latest meeting of the METI working group on how best to support the carbon capture and
storage (CCS) sector suggested the govt considers introducing a competitive auction system to
allocate funding for CCS transportation and storage projects. The aim is to reduce costs and foster
market competitiveness.
•  Consortiums would consist of emitters and transportation/ storage operators bidding on a per-ton
of CO2 transportation and storage fee. Carbon capture costs at emission sites, which vary
significantly by industry, wouldn’t be included in auction criteria.
•  Auctions could be held annually, beginning in the early 2030s, to slowly scale up CCS projects.
Maximum bid prices would be capped to reflect realistic costs, expansion potential, and project
risks.
•  The govt should seek to introduce a transparent funding framework to supports CCS operators
based on the difference between CCS costs and so-called industry-standard CO2 mitigation
expenses, aiming to eventually phase out state support as the CCS sector costs become competitive.
• TAKEAWAY: The development of business models for CCS in Japan is still at a very early stage. Early signs
indicate that METI is keen to deploy more of contract-for-differences and actions approaches used for other
energy sources. The annual auction cycle would give predictability for CCS operators.

METI Forges Ahead on ‘Simultaneous Market’ Plans to

Boost Renewables Integration
To improve electricity market efficiency and create a system capable of reliably
accommodating greater renewable energy penetration, METI is conducting an in-depth
review on introducing a simultaneous electricity market (同時市場) – a fundamentally
new approach to power trading in Japan.

In a simultaneous market, generation and consumption of electricity are balanced in
real-time, optimizing dispatch and pricing through a centrally coordinated system. This
approach integrates electricity supply and balancing services into a unified framework
capable of effectively managing real-time volatility in both production and demand.
Additionally, it facilitates better coordination among various ancillary and reserve
services, potentially reducing the costs associated with balancing power procurement.
Implementing such a system will necessitate significant structural changes in electricity
bidding processes, market offers, and methods for securing adjustment volumes.
Although inspired in part by the PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) system – the
largest independent system operator (ISO) in the U.S. – METI's deliberations on the
simultaneous market are already entering their third year. Nevertheless, recent
discussions indicate increasing confidence that Japan can successfully adapt and
implement this market structure.
The most recent METI committee meeting, held last week, focused extensively on
detailed presentations regarding market design options, international comparisons, and
strategic implementation considerations. Japan NRG takes a closer look at the
simultaneous market debate within the broader context of Japan’s evolving electricity
market reforms.

What is PJM and its impact on Japan?
The PJM system operator utilizes a nodal pricing system (also known as locational
marginal pricing or LMP) to determine wholesale electricity prices. This reflects the cost
of supplying an extra unit of energy at a specific location (node), considering grid
constraints.

Under this system, each node on the grid can have a different electricity price,
influenced by factors such as generation availability, transmission capacity, and
congestion. PJM centrally coordinates dispatch using detailed real-time data, enabling
economically efficient operations and clearer price signals for investment in generation
and transmission infrastructure.
Traditionally, Japan has utilized a regional-based market system rather than nodal
pricing. Prices are uniform across broad geographical zones, and detailed locational
constraints (congestion and transmission limitations) are typically managed through
administrative measures rather than direct market signals.

The introduction of a simultaneous market in Japan would represent a shift from that
broader, regional price approach to more granular, node-based price signals. It
essentially means using market-based solutions over administrative interventions to
alleviate network constraints.

Background: Market reforms
Before METI started power market liberalization, Japan’s electricity system was a
vertically integrated monopoly, with 10 regional power companies (EPCOs) controlling
the entire process of generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity.
This system’s advantage was that with exclusive control over their regional areas, the
EPCOs ensured a stable power supply. The downside was that it inhibited competition.
Pricing and investment decisions were regulated by METI, and consumers had no choice
of electricity provider.

Japan fully liberalized retail electricity sales in 2016, which has allowed over 700 new
companies to enter the power market and compete with the EPCOs, mostly on the retail
side. Market-based platforms to trade electricity were rolled out, primarily on the Japan
Electric Power Exchange (JEPX), which manages the Spot Market, Intraday Market,
Baseload Market, and Non-Fossil Fuel Value Trading Market.
Later, other platforms were added to mimic physical power systems. The OCCTO-
operated Capacity Market helps to secure availability of power plants several years from
now. This system was expanded two years ago with a Long-Term Decarbonization
Power Source Auction and Standby Power Source System, expanding the option of
securing capacity to the short-, middle- and long-term. Finally, in 2024 the Electric
Power Reserve Exchange (EPRX) took on the trading of all balancing power services,
which cover last-minute adjustments to available supply to ensure it meets demand.

Even with these reforms, challenges still persist. For example, generators say they need
stronger investment incentives, especially for low-carbon capacity, and for improving
system stability. The EPRX was designed to help Transmission System Operators (TSOs)
buy balancing reserves more efficiently in a competitive setting, instead of relying only
on their own resources; but major TSOs, particularly Tokyo and Chubu, largely avoid
using the platform.
Instead, the big utilities continue to secure balancing reserves using traditional methods
such as internal power adjustments or direct contracts. They claim that this is down to:

• Difficulty in predicting power demand and supply, especially with solar generation;
• Existing contracts that do not assume full use of EPRX;
• Preference for internal control instead of relying on an external system.

Recent updates in power market reform
On January 27, 2025, METI proposed an action plan to review the power market
reforms so far and set future directions. A special working group will be created under
the Electricity and Gas Basic Policy Subcommittee to review new necessary regulatory
and policy changes, including possible amendments to the Electricity Business Act.
The reform plan is divided into three major areas:

Mid-to-Long-Term Supply Security Mechanisms
• Increasing investment incentives for new power generation
• Strengthening mechanisms such as the Feed-in-Premium (FIP), Long-Term
Decarbonization Power Source Auction (LTDA), and the capacity market to ensure
adequate power volumes
• Encouraging investment in renewable energy and battery storage to improve long-
term stability

Development of New Electricity Price Indexes and Trading Markets
• Creating futures markets, forward contracts, and bilateral Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs) to provide more price predictability for electricity retailers and
generators
• Developing stable procurement methods to reduce price fluctuations and help
financial planning for market participants
Short-Term Trading and Balancing Markets
• Strengthening spot and balancing markets to increase operational efficiency.
• Introducing the Simultaneous Market
• Considering integrating the capacity market with the balancing market to improve
procurement efficiency

The discussions cover a broad range of issues, but METI expects them to lead to formal
policy recommendations by late FY2025, with possible law revisions taking place in
2026.

Simultaneous Market discussions
The METI study group that seeks how to set up a simultaneous market (同時市場) has
now held two meetings, the latest on March 24. The group spent much of early
deliberations reviewing the broader market reforms in the country and how a
simultaneous market would fit within that. Even today, one of the key areas of debate is
around pinning down the precise definition of what such a market is and how far its
reach should be.
As an example, one of the areas under review is what to do with self-scheduled
generation (自己計画電源) – power plants whose start-up/ shut-down and output is
determined independently by their operators, rather than by market dispatch
instructions. As such, operators have discretion whether to submit information on their
status.

As TSOs seek to optimize dispatch and run the grid efficiently, avoiding congestion,
they’d like to incentivise self-scheduled generation to report the details of their
operations. But some of these self-scheduled generators work under bilateral contracts.
Mandating the generators to bid on the simultaneous market (and share their
operations) would raise transparency but also create legal and accounting issues. For
example, how would they account for the difference between the market and the
contract prices? Even if the generators simply share the plant status information
without selling power via the market, new rules will be required to ensure compliance
with grid reliability and operational constraints.

The above is one of a plethora of discussion points outlined by METI’s study group, but
it shows how the group’s workings has started delving into the practical matters that all
market participants will face once a simultaneous market opens.
METI’s group has explored how the mechanism works overseas, referencing similar
markets established in Europe and North America, particularly Germany and the U.S.;
international experience shows differences in application across jurisdictions.

So, while a simultaneous market would be designed to balance real-time supply and
demand, there is a debate over the exact scope of services this market should cover.
Should it include services such as frequency control (周波数調整) and synchronous
reserve (同期予備力)? Or act as a comprehensive framework capable of quickly and
flexibly managing short-term imbalances? Even the application of a real-time market

20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

(リアルタイム市場)  has to take into account the specific grid infrastructure and
regulatory environment of Japan.

The group also has concerns about fairness and transparency, cautioning against
scenarios in which established players might gain undue advantages, or where price
mechanisms might unintentionally discourage market entry by innovative renewable
energy producers. These require adjustments to the regulations, clearer price signals,
and ways to encourage the market entry of innovative new technologies.
Of course, one thing is clear: the introduction of a simultaneous market would require
more sophisticated real-time information systems, advanced monitoring and control
technology, as well as significant upgrades to the electricity grid. The cost of such
upgrades have yet to be estimated but they will be substantial.

Challenges and next steps
Given the size and scope of the changes, a major challenge will be convincing all the
public and private stakeholders of the cost-benefit of this shift. The study group
recommended pilot projects and phased implementation strategies to test, refine, and
gradually demonstrate the market's effectiveness.
As for the next steps, the group plans to conduct detailed simulations and economic
modeling to quantify potential market impacts and benefits, while keeping an eye on
best practices abroad.

The group recognizes the significant potential benefits of enhancing grid reliability in
Japan with an eye to greater renewable energy integration, and more market-driven
signals, but their outlook is one of optimistic caution due to the significance of the
reforms.

The lackluster performance of the EPRX and the backup reserve markets shows how
important incentives are to ensure a broad set of market players buy in. Even in the
more popular markets, like the LTDA, there are tensions between big utilities like JERA
and the government.
Often, it seems like reforms of this scale move along at a snail’s pace, with the adoption
of the simultaneous market not expected for another three or more years. Given what’s
at stake, the steady nature of the deliberations may well be justified. And the time to
engage with METI on the planning should be now.

ANALYSIS

BY YURIY HUMBER

Japan’s Electricity Companies Are Cheap and Getting Cheaper
Japanese firms are the cheapest electricity stocks in the G7 — and the gap in market
values is widening.

The average major electricity company in Japan is worth 10 times less than one in
Europe, and 1/15th the value of one in the U.S., according to a review by Japan NRG.
The market capitalization of the top American utility, NextEra Energy, is enough to buy
all 10 Japanese regional power holdings — as well as the country’s top electricity
wholesaler — three times over.

The differences are not due to the size of generation assets. NextEra Energy has only
about 12% more capacity than TEPCO Holdings, the main supplier to the Tokyo area,
but it’s 30x more valuable. NuScale Power, a U.S. firm that has yet to build a single
working reactor, is worth 30% more than Kyushu Electric, utility with four reactors
(total capacity 4.14 GW) online today, as well as dozens of thermal and renewables
assets.
In the past twelve months, this divergence has accelerated with Japanese power utility
stocks losing value, despite lower fuel costs, while peers in Europe and the U.S. gained.
This potentially makes Japanese firms more of a target for M&A as well as significantly
hindering their fund-raising capabilities at a time when investments in the grid and
clean energy are imperative.

*NOTE: Due to publication of this article in today’s, March 31, 2025 edition of Japan
NRG, the below graphs actually cover the period of one day less than a full year. They
show performance for April 1, 2024 to March 28, 2025.

U.S. MARKET
S&P’s Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index (White) vs S&P’s 500 Index (Blue)














Year-on-Year Return: 19.2%
• U.S. utility stocks enjoyed a robust rally over the past year, easily outperforming
their global peers. The S&P 500 Utilities sector index climbed roughly +20% in
price from a year ago and as much as +25–27% total return including dividends.
This surge made utilities one of the best-performing S&P 500 sectors in the
timeframe.
• Drivers:
o As the Federal Reserve paused and eventually began signaling rate cuts,
bond yields stabilized or fell from 2023 highs. This made the utilities’
relatively high dividend yields attractive again, sparking investor interest in
defensive, income-producing stocks.
o Unlike in Europe, the U.S. economic outlook in late 2024 included some
growth concerns (raising recession odds) – this actually helped utilities, as
investors rotated into defensives in anticipation of a slowdown
o Company-specific boosts included NextEra raising dividends, Consolidated
Edison selling non-core assets, and Duke Energy streamlined operations by
exiting foreign markets

• European utility stocks have been rocked by a number of factors over the past year,
both in terms of the region’s macro outlook and global energy policy turbulence.
Still, a recent rally in Europe pushed the biggest utility index, the STOXX Europe
600 Utilities, close to the YoY gains of the U.S. market as Germany’s willingness to
relax its debt ceiling and optimism on trade led gains.
• Drivers:

• Unlike the U.S., Europe’s rate hikes persisted through 2023 (ECB rates peaked in
mid-2024), which raised borrowing costs for utilities (typically heavy debt issuers)
and made their high dividends less attractive. When the outlook shifted to
economic recovery and central banks began signaling rate cuts, investors rotated
away from defensives like utilities toward cyclicals.
• Fuel prices, especially for natural gas, stabilized in 2024 and even receded in the
latter half of the year thanks also to a milder winter 2023/24. This led to lower
input costs but also lower retail prices, reducing revenues at a time when some of
the European energy firms were still dealing with windfall profit taxes and price
caps.
• EU policy support for green energy (e.g. faster permits for renewables, EU Green
Deal investments) benefited utilities pivoting to wind/solar. And while firms such
as Orsted faced setbacks on large offshore wind projects due to higher costs and
financing challenges, European governments started to raise the subsidies offered
via capacity auctions.

• Japanese utilities had a bad year, with nearly all EPCOs losing value over the past
12 months. One major headwind for power indices has been the performance of
Tokyo Electric (TEPCO), which has lost about half of its value in the last year due
to the further deterioration of its financial condition. Still, TEPCO is not the only
utility to suffer in the past 12 months. The shares of Kansai Electric, now Japan’s
most valuable power company, are down 14% YoY despite the utility operating all
of its nuclear reactors. Other large power firms also saw double-digit drops with
only Shikoku Electric and J-Power (previously known as Electric Power
Development Co) able to post a positive return. The Nikkei 225 Index is down 7.6%
in the past 12 months – less than the drop for most power utilities.
• Drivers:
o Oddly enough, most of the drivers for EPCOs are positive, which makes
their share performance even stranger. The introduction of favorable
wheeling charges and changes to the Balancing Market rules are
expected to improve the profitability of the major power companies,
which control about 80% of the electricity supply in Japan.
o Fuel costs declined during 2024: LNG prices in yen terms were down
1.5% YoY and thermal coal prices down 6.2% in January while the

dollar-yen exchange was largely unchanged at about ¥150. Meanwhile,
most of the EPCOs raised rates in March 2025.
o The big drag on the sector remains TEPCO. Tokyo’s main utility is unable
to restart its only operable nuclear power plant while continuing to pay
out vast sums each year for decommissioning work at the Fukushima
Daiichi NPP and for disaster compensation. Earlier this month, TEPCO
published a new business plan that forecasts a ¥960 billion shortfall over
the next two years despite an expectation that profit will double. The
erosion of TEPCO’s capital base is at a level where it continues to operate
solely at the discretion of the state. The government took a controlling
stake after the Fukushima disaster.















The power sector’s performance contrasts with that of gas utilities. Tokyo Gas has shot
up by 40% YoY thanks to an expanded shareholder returns policy and an investment in
the company by the activist fund Elliott Management. But other large gas firms have
recorded positive growth on the back of improving financials and expectations of higher
demand for the fuel from industry.
















Japan Power Sector Outlook
The Bank of Japan is due to raise rates even further this year, which traditionally would
have been a drag on power stocks as utilities tend to raise capital through bond sales.
However, the arrival of higher rates is helping to revive investor appetite for utility
bonds, which until now offered miserly returns.

What’s more, power companies may be willing to switch their capital raising to equity.
Kansai Electric raised over ¥379 billion through a secondary share offering in November
2024, seeking capital for investments in data centers, renewables assets and overseas
operations. That’s an unusual move in the sector and may now be echoed at other
companies.
The biggest event in the sector remains the often-promised initial public offering by
JERA, the top utility by generation capacity and the biggest Japanese importer of LNG.
As JERA approaches investors, however, it hopes to persuade them that its valuation
should be based in reference to utilities overseas rather than domestic peers.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Green hydrogen
Australia will inject $511 million into the 1.5 GW Murchison Green Hydrogen project
that is led by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (Denmark).
Australia / Solar power
Danish renewable energy developer, European Energy, inaugurated a 58 MW solar PV
plant and started construction of a second project, a 106 MW solar park, in Victoria,
Australia.

China / Power regulation
Nvidia's business in China might suffer if Beijing implements energy efficiency rules
more strictly. The National Development and Reform Commission is advising Chinese
groups to use chips that meet stricter requirements in new data centers.
India / Coal
On March 20, India’s coal production reached one billion tons, which is 11 days ahead
of last fiscal year’s total output of 998 Mt, said the Coal Ministry. Coal accounts for 55%
of India’s energy mix, with 74% of electricity generated from coal-based power plants.

India / Power transmission
Adani Energy Solutions has won a $3.2 billion power transmission project in Gujarat to
supply green electrons for manufacturing green hydrogen and green ammonia.

India / Thermal power
The State of Odisha plans to add 10 GW of thermal power capacity in the next six years.
The state currently has 20 GW of operational capacity.
Indonesia / Energy transition
Funding isn’t an issue for the energy transition; the problem is project viability, said
Elrika Hamdi, deputy head of the Just Energy Transition Partnership. State electricity
firm PLN slowed renewables deployment. Investors should back captive power instead
of grid-based projects, she added.

Malaysia / Oil & Gas
A $230 million bailout of Sapura Energy, a major oil and gas services company, has
triggered a debate over PM Ibrahim’s pledge to end bailouts of troubled companies
using public funds.
Philippines / Solar power
Taiwan-based Giga Solar Materials Corp, through its renewable energy subsidiary,
Wholesun Energy, has partnered with Wyn Power Corp to develop a 50-MW solar farm
in Batangas.

Singapore / Methanol bunkering
Following finalization of the methanol bunkering licensing framework and standards,
the Maritime and Port Authority has opened applications for licensees to supply
methanol as a marine fuel.
