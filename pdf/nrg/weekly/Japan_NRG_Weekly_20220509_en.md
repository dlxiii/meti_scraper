NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Japan, US energy ministers agree to collaborate on clean LNG, sign MoC on CCUS
(METI statement, May 5)
•  METI minister and the U.S. Department of Energy secretary agreed to collaborate on clean LNG
supplies and signed a Memorandum of Cooperation on CCUS.
•  The parties agreed LNG has a role in alleviating energy supply constraints and that the two
governments will facilitate stable and cleaner supply of LNG with lower methane emissions.
•  They’ll continue to promote renewables and small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) development and

will launch a new bilateral framework called Clean Energy and Energy Security Initiative. The
memorandum covers CCUS / conversion and recycling, CO2 removal technologies including direct
air capture, and storage, as well as low-carbon hydrogen/fuel ammonia value chain.



State Foreign Minister Odawara slams BlackRock’s sustainability approach

(Japan NRG, April 27)
•  Japan’s state Foreign Minister Odawara Kiyoshi criticized BlackRock for classifying LNG as a
stranded asset. In his speech at the Asia Energy Security Seminar, Odawara said LNG is a valuable
resource since it plays a role in the transition to net-zero. He wasn’t comfortable with overseas
sustainability philosophies, naming BlackRock.
•  IEA’s Tim Gould, who also spoke at the Seminar, appeased Odawara, saying every country has a
unique situation and varied transition strategies.

•  Odawara’s remark preceded a bilateral energy ministers meeting in Washington on May 4.



Tokyo government exercises shareholder right to pressure TEPCO
(Japan NRG, May 2)
•  Tokyo government, which owns a 1.2% stake of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO),

said it will exercise its shareholder right to secure stable power supply while supporting the
expansion of renewables capacity. Tokyo is proposing to revise the company’s charter to add
clauses elaborating on its commitment to power supply stability, by restarting idled power stations,
securing fuel, maximizing expansion of offshore wind and other renewables, avoiding power rate
hikes, and removing electric poles to prevent disasters.
•  Tokyo also seeks a pact with TEPCO to guarantee supply stability, following earlier warnings from
the national government that power supply will be tight in the coming summer and winter.
•  CONTEXT: In 2012, Tokyo sought corporate charter changes to clarify TEPCO’s supply

responsibilities. The company board rejected it, saying the charter is not meant to spell out
operational level goals. Outside of Tokyo, TEPCO serves eight prefectures, where it has twice as
many customers as in Tokyo.

NEWS:     POWER       MARKETS






PM Kishida keen to restart nuclear reactors
(TV Tokyo Biz, April 26)
•  PM Kishida said that restarting a single nuclear power plant in Japan would free up 1 million metric
tons of LNG per year for the global LNG market.
•  The PM said the regulatory framework must be tested to determine the extent it will allow reactor
restarts.
• TAKEAWAY: What is interesting in the PM’s pronouncement isn’t the call for nuclear reactor restarts, or even

the framing of the issue as a way to “free up” LNG for the global market – and therefore send a message to
European and American allies that Japan is doing its part to solve the issues thrown up by sanctions against
Russia. The fact that PM Kishida is ready to discuss the role of the nuclear regulator is probably the most
progressive statement by a Japanese politician in years. Since the dismantling of the previous regulator, which
was seen as too close to the nuclear industry and directly under thumb of METI, an unwieldy system was
created in which the new Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) can operate almost without limitations. One

result of this is that safety reviews of some reactors are now in their nineth year with no end in sight. This is not
the only barrier to nuclear plant restarts in Japan, but it is a big one. How far the PM is willing to wade into this
sensitive issue is not yet clear, but the fact that he has mentioned it at all may is significant.
• As our Data Book (distributed on May 6, 2022) showed, there are only four nuclear reactors operating in Japan

right now. For Japan to lower its LNG consumption and meet 2030 net-zero targets, it likely needs five times
that number online.



Local residents unhappy about new nuclear reactor

(Mainichi Shimbun, May 5)
•  A new experimental reactor is planned for the site of the defunct Monju reactor, which is being
decommissioned after decades of problems.
•  The experimental reactor will have an output of 10 MW, making it much smaller than the 71 MW
Monju. It will also require a smaller staff to operate.
•  Many local residents are unhappy, citing the Fukushima disaster and the presence of active faults

under the Tsuruga Peninsula.
• TAKEAWAY: Although recent polls show that for the first time in a decade more than half of the population
seems to favor the restart of nuclear reactors to help cool electricity prices and improve energy security,
construction of new nuclear facilities is still a very problematic topic in Japan.

The case for abolishing the ¥0.01 minimum energy price
(Nikkei Energy Next, April 25)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion article by the Nikkei Energy Next electricity panel.

•  While negative pricing isn’t allowed on the Japan Electric Power Exchange spot market, it is
allowed on European markets.
•  The media argues that an ability to set negative prices for electricity would help vitalize Japan’s
energy market.
•  This would require the abolition of the current minimum bid of ¥0.01/ kWh.




Half of major power utilities report losses on rising fuel prices
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, May 3)
•  Five of the 10 major power companies reported a net loss for the fiscal year ending March 31,
2022, while the remaining five also posted large decreases in profits. High fuel prices, a tight
supply-demand situation in the power market, and the earthquake in March were the main causes,

according to TEPCO President Kobayakawa.
•  Tohoku Electric posted the second largest loss in its history, blaming a rule that delays the ability
of utilities to pass on rising fuel prices to customers for several months.
•  Outlook for this year is uncertain, both in terms of fuel imports and power demand recovery due to
the pandemic. As such, nine of the 10 companies did not set earnings forecasts for this year. The
only one that did, Kansai Electric, expects a net loss.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Chubu Electric vows to cut market purchases to zero
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, May 2)
o  Chubu Electric plans to stop buying electricity from the wholesale market (JEPX) as much
as possible in the current fiscal year in order to improve profitability.
o  The utility procured 15% of its electricity volumes from the market and the high prices ate
into profits. The utility posted a loss for the last fiscal year.




Weak yen forces Marubeni to pull out of electricity retail
(Diamond, April 29)
•  Major trading company Marubeni is preparing to discontinue its electricity retail operation due to

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Marubeni instructed some subscribers to find new suppliers and has even served some with legal
termination notices.
•  CONTEXT: In the past 12 months, 31 electricity retailers said they’re discontinuing operations.
• TAKEAWAY: According to a recent survey by Tokyo Shoko Research, which asked more than 200 power
retailers in the Japan market about the financial situation, more than half of the so-called “new electric power

companies” reported losses for 2021, which is up from just under a quarter a year earlier. We are likely to see
further market consolidation here over the coming year.

Suppliers worry about cost pressures after rock-bottom wind tender
(Shukan Economist, May 10)
•  After a Mitsubishi-led consortium won a tender to build three wind farms in Akita and Chiba
prefectures by offering tariffs between 1/2 and 1/3 of the maximum FIT tariff, project

subcontractors said they’re concerned they’ll be expected to absorb the deep discounts.
•  The turbines used will be sourced from GE, and will contain Toshiba nacelles.
•  While GE offered a discount due to the large size of the order (134 turbines), it’s unlikely to offer
any additional discounts. In fact, GE turbines for the Japanese market are priced between 20-30%
higher than those for the EU.
•  Reducing costs to European levels would require significant cost reductions in the domestic supply

chain, and this is why suppliers are so worried.
•  Turbine components and towers will eventually be sourced from, and maintained by, local
manufacturers and steelmakers. But engineering, procurement and construction will go to a range
of Kashima suppliers, including JFE Engineering, Penta-Ocean Construction, TOA Corporation and
Fukuda Salvage & Marine, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and Fuji Electric.



JERA to develop at least 1 GW of solar in partnership with West Holdings

(Company Statement, April 27)
•  JERA and West Holdings will form a business alliance to develop solar power generation projects

•  Based on an alliance agreement, the two will develop solar power projects for JERA at new sites
and at former JERA power plant sites in Japan, with a total development target of at least 1 GW

over 4 years through the end of FY2025.
•  If all projects are built as planned, JERA will become one of Japan’s largest solar power generation
producers.
•  The two companies also agreed to consider JERA’s purchase of electricity generated by solar
facilities owned and operated by West, and to explore joint solar power generation business
opportunities for third parties in Japan and overseas.

Critical minerals to account for 49% of energy trade in 2050: IEA
(Japan NRG, April 27)
•  Critical minerals will account for 49% of energy trades in 2050, compared to 19% in 2019, Tim

Gould, IEA Chief Economist told the Foreign Ministry forum. If the world moved to a net-zero
scenario by 2050, the minerals will comprise the core of energy trades. If the shifts do not
accelerate from the current pace, critical minerals ’share will still increase to 18%. Hydrogen’s share
will increase to 35% in 2050 in the net-zero scenario, or 7% under a slower transition scenario,
Gould said, speaking at the Asia Energy Security Seminar.
•  CONTEXT: Growing demand for critical resources may outgrow IEA’s forecast as many
governments will be updating their renewable energy strategies following the Ukraine war. The

burgeoning demand will increase metal prices and cost of magnets used in renewable systems.
•  Capital cost of onshore wind power stations is ¥270,000-280,000/ kW, and equipment accounts for
roughly ¥48,000/ kW. One MW power station with a rare earth magnet (200 kg neodymium, 80 kg
praseodymium, 50 kg dysprosium and 30 kg niobium) would require ¥18,000/ kW for rare earth
raw materials alone at current prices.


Japan’s LNG stocks rise to 1.95 million tons

•  Japan’s LNG stocks stood at 1.95 million tons on April 24, up from 1.76 million tons a week earlier
and the highest this year. End-April stocks last year were 2.01 million tons and the four-year
average was 1.9 million tons.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
TOP INTERVIEW: Japan’s Leading Rare Earths Expert

Japan NRG sat down with KAWASAKI Yutaka, President of K.K. Planet, to discuss the
backbone of the clean energy revolution – raw materials. He discussed the missing
links between stated carbon neutrality goals and realities, especially with respect to
rare earth metals supply. Kawasaki is a pioneer of rare earths trading in Japan and
provides expert views to state-backed Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National
Corporation.


SHANGHAI LOCKDOWNS AFFECT WIND, BATTERIES SECTORS
Japan imports around 21,000 tons/year of rare earth elements, of which around 60%
comes from China. How has the recent lockdown of Shanghai due to an outbreak of
Covid infections impacted supplies?

The lockdown really hit supply of cerium and lithium metals and also magnesium, all
of which are classified as dangerous goods, and need to be exported specifically out
of Shanghai. Cerium and lithium metals affect nickel metal hydride and other battery
supply chains. Presently, battery component makers appear to be coping by tapping
into their stockpiles. But these are limited and we may see the impact [from
lockdowns] soon.

Trading houses do not keep stocks of dangerous materials. Substitute supplies are not
easy to find as they are not produced in India or Vietnam.

The good news is, there are soft signs of Shanghai authorities moving to relax the
lockdown. Yesterday, our supplier told us they will start moving warehouse supplies
for loading. Maybe the end of the crisis is near.

Learning from this experience, Japanese consumers will increase metal stocks. Still,
these stocks are not easy to manage as they oxidize and their properties degrade.
You cannot keep them for over a year.

The supply flow of dysprosium and neodymium, both of which are used for wind
power station magnets, were not affected as much. Some supplies were loaded in
Shanghai but they were effectively shifted to Tianjin and Xiamen.

Key raw materials for magnets include praseodymium, neodymium, dysprosium, and
terbium. Energy applications account for around 20% of rare earth magnets. Wind
power stations are the key magnet users but they may possibly be expanding to
geothermal and hydro power. Magnets are also mounted in cars, PC hard disk drives
and household appliances with energy saving features.

Also, prices have skyrocketed. Dysprosium costs $500/kg and terbium around
$2,500/kg.

DECARBONIZATION PLANS VS REALITIES
Japan’s national strategy is to build an offshore wind power industry almost from
scratch and boost onshore wind capacity by 70% by 2030. Toyota plans to
manufacture 3.5 million electric vehicles in 2030, from 15,000 units today. These plans
alone would see Japan’s demand for rare earths surge 300 times within this decade.
Will there be enough supply?

I am skeptical about the various net zero scenarios. Automakers’ plans require rare
earths, as well as nickel, cobalt and lithium. Nothing can stop them from being
ambitious, but I feel the automakers are talking about “zero carbon” without
addressing the raw material supply issues. Securing raw materials has been the
missing issue in their pronouncements.

The Ukraine war has elevated the debate around new energy. There are questions
around how to secure power supplies to run EVs, how to secure gas for power
generation, and so on. I believe many carbon neutrality plans will need to be modified
and adjusted to reflect realities. For example, rather than a shift to EVs from vehicles
that run on petroleum fuels, introducing more hybrid vehicles could be more realistic.
The gap between resource reality and energy transition goals is far too wide right
now.

There are other ways to fight climate change. Like, setting up solar and wind power
stations in the no-entry zones in Fukushima, and making use of the power transmission
lines that connected the Fukushima nuclear plants with Tokyo.

Do you know why magnets of scrapped hybrid vehicles are not collected for
recycling? Because they are re-used as magnets. Instead of dismantling old wind
power stations to recycle the metals, why not re-use the power station equipment?
This way, there would be much less environmental impact.


JAPAN CANNOT MOVE AWAY FROM CHINA
While countries and companies are scrambling for limited supplies of energy raw
materials, Japan’s long-term strategy seems to be to shift away from China. Is there
evidence of this?

Neodymium leads in terms of China decoupling. There are increases in supplies from
Australia and the U.S., and Russia too, although this cannot be factored into business
scenarios. In my view, even if the war in Ukraine comes to an end, the U.S. will
continue to sanction Russia, and Japan will not be able to sell goods that contain
Russian raw materials.

However, Japan cannot completely break away from Chinese dysprosium and terbium
supplies. China has the reserves, as well as the technologies to smelt and refine those
ores.

Japan needs to diversify rare earth metal supplies, but it needs to rethink totally
blocking Chinese supplies. Japan was able to come this far thanks to China supplying
the required resources. I am 100% sure that a shift away from China is impossible.
Japan relies on Chinese resources and this will not change. We need to think about
working together.

There was a bilateral public-private business framework to discuss various aspects of
rare earths (back in 2012). We need the bilateral framework to study, for example, rare
earth applications. Japan has application technologies which China needs. China, like
Japan, is shifting to EVs. China, like Japan, has been looking for rare earth reserves
beyond its borders, because they may not have enough on their hands.


THE ROLE OF RECYCLING
How about recycling? Japan plans to become a global rare earth recycling hub.

Japan, and also China and Vietnam, have unveiled various recycling initiatives in the
past decade or two. But the Japanese government has been late in this.


18

Recycling consisted of re-using scrap generated during rare earth metals processing
and production. But we need to push for recycling from manufactured products, such
as used magnets. This requires more work.

A proper recycling system has not yet been established because it’s difficult enough
just to collect the used magnets. Who is going to dismantle a PC, take out the hard
disk drives and take out the magnets? Or open up an air conditioner and scoop out
the magnet? The routes to achieve this have not been set up.

Also, will it make economic sense to recycle? I believe in 2030, primary rare earths will
remain the main source of supply. So, Japan needs to rethink how it can get along
with and work with China.


RARE EARTHS’ CARBON FOOTPRINT
There are some concerns that more use of rare earth elements would increase our
carbon footprint and environmental impact. What is your view?

There is no reliable data available at this point on emissions involved in the
production of each kilogram of rare earths due to the complexity of the processes.
Emission would also vary depending on the state of the mines and the end-uses.

JOBS   IN  JAPAN’S     ENERGY       SECTOR


BY ARTHUR (RIKU) OGAWA

Fast Movers Benefit the Most in a Tight Market

This year, Japan’s renewable energy labor market has retained its authentic trait of
being largely candidate-driven. There is a shortage of candidates amid an abundance
of job openings, in contrast to the situation in most developed economies with a strong
renewable energy industry, such as the UK or Australia.

The market structure is not the only difference. There are other traits that are particular
to Japan’s labor market, which are especially important for overseas companies to keep
in mind as they expand locally:

o  Low Candidate Visibility: The go-to platforms that provide candidates visibility are not
yet widely used in Japan. Only about 3% of professionals in Japan are registered on
LinkedIn. What’s more, the country has one of the lowest percentages of English

speakers among developed economies.

o  Long-Termism Culture: Japan is famous for its lifetime-employment labor market. While
that was starting to shift in recent years, recent economic tailwinds have pushed back the
shift with candidates again favoring stability.

o  Older Demographic: Over 34% of the population is above 60, which is also the

retirement age in most companies.

o  Candidate-Driven Demand: There are about two jobs for each applicant on average, with
the ratio rising to 10:1 in some of the emerging and dynamic industries.

o  Brand Is King: Facing intense competition for top candidates, companies with well-

represented brands, as well as those willing to accept high flexibility and act quickly, are
the ones that tend to “beat the market”.

In the renewable sector it’s not unusual to see candidates with three or more competing
offers. This makes it harder for employers to control hiring and onboarding. In addition,
the interview process often drags on for weeks or months, which means those that act
fast tend to be the ones that secure the best talent.

The chart on the next page shows the average time required to fill a position for a mid-
level management / specialist and higher in Japan’s renewables sector. This includes
positions with manufacturers, EPC contracts, developers, private equity funds and
others, and it spans jobs in everything from offshore and onshore wind and solar to
energy storage, ammonia and hydrogen.

For reference, there’s also the timeframe for hiring sales staff outside of the renewables
sector.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Canada/ Renewable energy
S&P Global Market Intelligence reports that Canada added 5.56 GW of wind and solar
power capacity in 2021. Most additions were in the Alberta province where a
deregulated market for surplus power sales and emissions credit valuation and trade
encouraged investment in renewables.

Energy/ Blockchain
The use of blockchain technology in energy markets might grow by $920 million by
2026, according to research by Technavio. Blockchain can help prevent failure in
power grids. However, the high costs of implementing and maintaining the
technology remain obstacles.

Finland/ Nuclear power
A consortium has canceled plans to build a Russian nuclear power plant. The Hanhikivi
1 project was controversial because Rosatom, the state nuclear company in Moscow,
was both the supplier of the reactor and also the main shareholder, with a 34% stake.

France/ LNG
State-backed utility Engie signed a 5-year deal to buy LNG from Houston-based
NextDecade, marking a major reversal. In November 2020, Engie suspended talks
with NextDecade after the French government, a 24% shareholder, raised
environmental concerns.

India/ Wind power
Envision Energy will build 2 GW of wind power capacity by 2024. The 596 wind
turbines will be made in Envision's local factory that’s still under construction. The
company’s wind turbine design seeks to maximize energy produced from the low
winds common in the country.

India/ Renewable energy
In a deal worth $1.55 billion, Shell will acquire Solenergi Power Private Ltd, the
flagship company of Sprng Energy group, from UK-based Actis. Sprng Energy
supplies solar and wind power to electricity distribution companies in India.
Indonesia/ Geothermal power
State energy firm PT Pertamina will invest $4 billion to double geothermal capacity
over the current 700 MW by 2027-2028. The Energy Ministry says the country can
potentially generate more than 28 GW of geothermal power, up from the current
national total of 2.3 GW.

Italy/ Energy crisis
Italy approved a €14 billion support package to help vulnerable families and
businesses with rising energy prices. A new windfall tax on energy company profits will
fund the measures, which include a one-off cash payment of €200 for those with low

incomes or pensions, as well as energy price subsidies for vulnerable families, and tax
credits for businesses.

UK/ Oil
BP’s exit from Russia left the company with a $20.4 billion loss in Q1. BP wrote off its
stake in energy giant Rosneft, the largest hit by any western oil and gas company
following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Even so, due to rising global energy prices,
BP’s Q1 profit was $6.25 billion, more than double the result for the same quarter last
year.

U.S./ Solar power
State environmental regulators approved plans to build Sunnyside Solar Farm in
Houston, soon to be the nation’s largest urban solar farm. Electricity will be generated
by an array of 150,000 solar panels — enough to power 10,000 homes. It’s planned to
be operational by July 2023.

U.S./ Oil policy
The American Petroleum Institute, a top U.S. oil and natural gas group, is protesting a
bill in Congress that would make OPEC countries and its partners vulnerable to
lawsuits for collusion on boosting petroleum prices. The NOPEC bill would give the
U.S. Attorney General the power to sue oil-producing countries under anti-trust laws.
