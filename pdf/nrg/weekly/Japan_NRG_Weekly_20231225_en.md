NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY






Hyogo Pref to tighten regulations on solar power systems, to take effect in Oct 2024

(Government statement, Dec 12)
•  Hyogo Pref plans to revise the Solar Power Ordinance and introduce permits for installation of
facilities with an area of at least 5,000 m2, and for cut and fill areas exceeding 3,000 m2 in privately
owned forests.
•  CONTEXT: Presently, solar projects over 5,000 m2 are required to report their plans to the
municipalities but do not require permits.

•  The governor made the decision out of concern over potential accidents involving collapsed solar
panels and possible impact on local biodiversity.
•  The changes take effect on Oct 1, 2024, if the prefectural assembly approves the proposed
amendments of the ordinance.




Revealed: divide between winners and losers in Round 2 offshore wind auction

•  The bids were rated based on a 240-point scale, with credits awarded for pricing and operational
feasibility. The decision reflects major changes to the rules. In Round 1, one company, trading
house Mitsubishi, was able to dominate thanks to a better price offer.
•  Under the previous rules, up to 20 points were granted for the feasibility of a plan, with schedule
considered as just one factor. The new rules grant up to 20 points for how quickly the plan can be
executed.
•  What was decisive in the auction was the schedule and ideas on how the project will contribute to
the local economy.
•  The Sumitomo-TEPCO alliance won the project in Nagasaki Pref thanks to better pricing as the
consortium managed to secure several offtakers such as Sumitomo Metal Mining and SUMCO, a
producer of silicon wafers for semiconductors.
•  The winning bidders for the Niigata project, RWE and Mitsui, won approval from the local
community with its business strategy, according to business insiders.

Energy outlook for 2024 by Prof Kikkawa: Investment in innovative energy tech is key
(Diamond, Dec 19)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by Kikkawa Takeo, head of the International University of
Japan and a professor of economics specializing in the energy sector. Kikkawa discusses trends

likely to emerge in 2024.
•  The energy industry will see decisions driven by global goals for CO2 reduction by 2035 in line
with the recent G7 target to cut emissions by 60% over 2019 levels.
•  The govt will hasten to formulate the 7th Basic Energy Plan to meet its decarbonization targets and
implement measures included in the updated policies and regulations on the Green
Transformation (GX).
•  Investment in the following sectors and technology in the next decade is expected to reach ¥105

trillion; the minimum budget for each is in brackets:
o  Automotive industry (¥37 trillion): advancement of EVs, FCVs and PHVs with expansion of
battery storage tech, hydrogen and e-fuels, respectively;
o  Renewables (¥20 trillion): expected progress in offshore wind as the price to generate
electricity is anticipated to drop to ¥10/ kWh; wider use of perovskite solar PVs for power
generation at public facilities;
o  Real estate and construction (¥14 trillion): expected progress in thermal insulation

improvement as a way to address challenges in energy conservation;
o  Next-gen networks (¥11 trillion): two HVDC transmission lines connecting Hokkaido and
Honshu, combined capacity of 1.2 GW to launch in 2028;
o  Ammonia and hydrogen (¥7 trillion): ammonia could become more widely used than
hydrogen;
o  Battery storage tech (¥7 trillion): increasing domestic lithium-ion battery supply chain

amid excessive reliance on China.
•  Nuclear power (including next-gen reactors) isn’t included in the policy, and the projected amount
of public and private investment is only ¥1 trillion.




Japan and AZEC discuss finance for energy transition; Asia needs ¥4 quadrillion
(Nikkei Asia, Dec 18)
•  During the AZEC summit in Tokyo, the 11 member countries discussed strategies to support
"transition finance" to fund clean energy projects.
•  PM Kishida said that decarbonizing Asia needs about ¥4 quadrillion (about $28 trillion). He

announced the world's first ‘climate bonds’, worth ¥1.6 trillion, which will be issued in February,
aiming to catalyze private sector and regulatory collaboration.
• TAKEAWAY: ‘Climate bonds’ is likely a reference to the GX-linked bond issuance by the government that was
previously referred to as GX Economic Transition Bond. That was always a temporary name, and it is not clear
if ‘Climate bonds’ is now the finalized term. But whatever the bonds are labeled as, they will be viewed
skeptically by a significant portion of European and American investors. This is due to concerns over potential
greenwashing. Japan relies on fossil fuels and strategies such as mixing greener fuels with coal, as well as

hydrogen with natural gas, in power plants. These combinations are deemed acceptable under the Japanese
taxonomy, but may not align with those from other jurisdictions. After all, what is allowed to be called “green”
or “clean” is still subjective and varies across countries and regions. So, investors will need to consider which
6



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

standards and taxonomies they wish to align with. For sure, a notable amount of funds will find Japan’s
taxonomy at odds with their local standards and refrain from allocating to GX-related issuances.

Still, Japan's initiative is significant as it could influence other countries, especially AZEC members. Many other
countries in Asia have a similar power mix to Japan and do not, at this point, wish to commit entirely to
renewable energy sources. So, investors skeptical of Japan’s approach would need to extend the same to
other AZEC members, which could result in missing out on (likely) a significant section of the bonds market.
Thus, the investment sector will need to address these taxonomy differences. And, should the AZEC approach
find sympathy, Japan could emerge as a leader in this new financial space.





Santos poised to dominate Japan’s e-methane exports with Toho deal
(Japan NRG, Dec 22)
•  Gas producer Santos (Australia) could become the largest exporter of synthetic methane (e-
methane) to Japan, according to a Japan NRG analysis.
•  On Dec 13, Toho Gas and Santos Ventures signed a joint study agreement to produce synthetic
methane (e-methane) in the Cooper Basin area and export 30,000 tons /year to Japan by 2030.

•  Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas have similar agreements with the Santos group (See table). The three
gas utilities satisfied their 2030 supply requirements with Santos supplies.
•  Japan’s e-methane supply goal is 360 million m3 (257,142 tons), or 1% of total city gas supplies in
2030. Santos alone will have 58% of the Japanese market.

Gas utilities’ agreements with Santos
Partner   Agreement type 2030 supply goal
Toho Gas Santos Ventures Joint study agreement 30,000 tons /year
Tokyo Gas Santos Ventures MoU   60,000 tons /year

Panasonic nixes plans for a $5 billion EV battery plant in Oklahoma

(Nikkei, Dec 20)
•  Panasonic Energy will drop plans to build a $5 billion battery factory in Oklahoma.
•  But the company said that construction continues on a $4 billion factory in Kansas that’s set to
launch in March 2025.
•  The company said: "This decision will not impact our operations in Nevada or Kansas; we have
made a long-term commitment to investing in and advancing the EV industry in the United States.”
•  CONTEXT: Demand in Japan for EVs remains modest. In October, Panasonic Energy announced

plans to slash its electric battery production in Japan by 60%. Meanwhile, EV sales in the U.S. have
surpassed 1 million, up about 50% YoY, and the first time they’ve exceeded that milestone in a
single sales year. With Tesla its biggest customer, Panasonic Energy is growing its presence in the
U.S. Of the 11 overseas plants in operation owned by Panasonic Energy, two are in the U.S.
(Nevada and Georgia) and one is in Mexico.

Tokyo Gas partner Octopus Energy raises $800 mln in latest funding round
(Financial Times, Dec 18)
•  UK-based Octopus Energy raised $800 million, boosting its valuation to $7.8 billion, almost double
the $4.6 billion in 2021.
•  Founded in 2015, Octopus Energy is the UK’s second-largest household energy supplier.

•  CONTEXT: Tokyo Gas owns almost 10% of Octopus, which used this partnership to expand into
Japan’s market. The company’s mission statement is to “bring smart energy to Japanese homes…
focusing on solar and EV expansion, and with the latest rollout of our EV tariff in Japan.”




Solar startup PXP reports 23% efficiency for perovskite-CIGS tandem cell
(Nikkei Sangyo, Dec 18)
•  Solar startup PXP reported a 23% efficiency for a tandem solar cell composed of a perovskite
crystal layer and a CIGS (copper-indium-selenium-gallium) layer. The article did not elaborate on

cell size.
•  CONTEXT: Power efficiencies of PSC modules are generally below 20%. Tandem types seek
increases by putting silicon, CIGS, cadmium telluride (CdTe) and other thin photovoltaic materials
on the perovskite layer. However, the tandem modules may become less bendable.

Tandem PSC research in Japan
Key developers           Tandem types
PXP, Idemitsu Kosan, Tokyo University CIGS

Kaneka, Sharp, Toshiba, Kyocera, Tokyo
Silicon
City University, Tokyo University
• TAKEAWAY: A 23% efficiency is not so impressive; Tokyo University and Idemitsu Kosan reported 28%.
However, PXP is worth noting because it was founded in 2020 by Kameda Shigeaki, a former top executive at
Solar Frontier, an Idemitsu affiliate. Competition is expected to heat up between these companies in the
tandem PSC / CIGS space. Solar Frontier commercialized CIS (a type of CIGS) in 2011, but stopped production
last year.





Japan to invest ¥3 trillion over 15 years to promote hydrogen and ammonia
(Denki Shimbun, Dec 19)
•  Japan will invest ¥3 trillion over 15 years to compensate for the price difference between existing
fuels and cleaner alternatives – hydrogen and ammonia – to promote and expand their distribution
volume and cut the cost for consumers.
•  The govt will support the use of hydrogen and ammonia with funds raised from GX transition

bonds that will be issued starting February 2024. The scale of investment using green bonds is
around ¥13 trillion.
•  It also plans to support the low-cost development of next-gen renewables such as perovskite PVs,

IHI aims for ¥900 billion in ammonia sales in 2040-2050
(Denki Shimbun, Dec 19)
•  IHI seeks to boost ammonia fuel sales to about ¥900 billion for 2040-2050.
•  Specifically, it plans to develop ammonia combustion tech for large gas turbines with General

Electric to boost fuel demand. Research is being conducted in Southeast Asia and the Middle East
on potential production and sales of green ammonia.
•  IHI seeks to establish an ammonia supply network in Yamaguchi Pref with Idemitsu, and in Osaka
Pref with KEPCO and Mitsui.
•  CONTEXT: IHI's revenue is projected at ¥1.3 trillion in FY2023, which indicates the significance of
the projected ¥900 billion in sales from the ammonia business. IHI President Ide said that IHI "will
invest firmly in ammonia and methanation, which we have positioned as our growth business.”




IHI, Malaysian Gentari to commercialize 100% ammonia-fueled power by 2026

(Japan NRG, Dec 18)
•  IHI and Gentari Hydrogen signed an MoU to commercialize 100% ammonia-fueled power
generation in Malaysia in 2026.
•  Gentari, which is an affiliate of Petronas, will install IM270, a 2 MW turbine developed by IHI. If the
timeline is met, Gentari might be the world’s first power supplier to commercialize full ammonia-
firing.
•  IHI developed a dual flow ammonia burner that enables greater control over ammonia combustion

and cuts NOx emissions.
•  CONTEXT: JERA’s plan to commercialize 20% ammonia-coal co-firing at a 1 GW plant is so far the
world’s largest ammonia-fueled power project but it is not expected to move onto commercial
phase until 2027 at the earliest.
• TAKEAWAY: IHI’s fully ammonia-fueled turbine rollout is ahead of schedule, as FY2027 was the target to
complete it under the Green Innovation Fund program. However, 2 MW is tiny for a commercial operation. It’s

not clear whether Gentari will deploy a dozen turbines or just one.

Nippon Steel to acquire U.S. Steel to boost capacity
(Company statement, Dec 18)
•  Nippon Steel will acquire U.S. Steel pending regulatory approval, hoping to expand annual
production to 8.6 million tons, up from the current 6.6 million tons.

• TAKEAWAY: While Nippon Steel claims that in the long run the deal with U.S. Steel will cut emissions, in the
short term they’ll increase along with output. Rather than acquiring hydrogen steel startups or CCUS
operators, Nippon Steel seeks to secure its business in North America. This move is not positive for electric arc
furnace operators, which do not consume coal and have lower carbon intensity; they are specialized small
businesses and can’t compete with integrated steelmakers like Nippon Steel.

KEPCO cancels construction of thermal power plant in Wakayama
(Company statement, Dec 19)
•  KEPCO canceled construction of a planned thermal power plant in Wakayama City.
•  The project was first conceived 30 years ago, but never got off the ground. As a result, KEPCO
expects to take a hit of ¥123 billion.
•  The proposed LNG-fired power plant was intended to be the largest in KEPCO’s portfolio and

have a capacity of 3.7 GW.
• TAKEAWAY: KEPCO's recent strategy is to prioritize nuclear power over coal/gas-fired power. The company is
decommissioning thermal power units and developing co-firing hydrogen and LNG, resulting in losses of at
least ¥100 billion. Still, the company's financial performance remains strong, thanks to NPP restarts.
Consolidated net profit for FY2023 is expected to be ¥405 billion, surpassing the ¥161 billion in FY2005, and
setting a new record high.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI seeks change to balancing charge of FIT installations to promote FIP
(Denki Shimbun, Dec 20)
•  METI and ANRE proposed to review the balancing charge for certified operators under the FIP
system. The balancing cost was introduced to encourage the transition away from FIT for
renewable energy operators.

•  Under the current system launched in FY2022 alongside the FIP, a balance cost of ¥1/ kWh is
granted to certified operators and the amount is reduced each year until FY2030.
•  A proposal was made to set the amount at ¥1/ kWh for the first year of operation in order to
increase FIP certification, and then to reduce it in stages.
•  CONTEXT: The system was supposed to encourage a swift transition to FIP, but so far only 1 GW
of new FIP and transition projects have been completed.

End of an era as electronics giant Toshiba delists from stock exchange
(Denki Shimbun, Dec 18)
•  Toshiba announced a new management structure as it approaches delisting on Dec 20. The
company aims to rebuild its management under the supervision of minority shareholders after

fending off activist investors.
•  To repay the substantial debt incurred related to privatization, Toshiba is considering re-listing.
However, there are challenges: the unresolved handling of Kioxia Holdings after the failed sale,
and factors such as stock market conditions and interest rates.
•  The alignment of more than 20 investors and lenders will also be key in reconstruction. Companies
like Rohm, Chubu Electric, Orix, and MinebeaMitsumi, with diverse interests, are involved.
•  CONTEXT: Once the leader of Japan's global dominance in electronics, Toshiba’s delisting ends a

74-year history with Tokyo's Stock Exchange. Since 2015, Toshiba has been accused of inflating its
profit by $1.6 billion. An investigation in 2021 found that Toshiba colluded with METI, which saw
the company as a strategic asset, to suppress the interests of foreign investors. Also, in 2016,
Toshiba said it would take charge of construction of a nuclear power plant that Westinghouse
Electric had bought a year earlier. Three months later, Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy leaving
Toshiba facing the collapse of its nuclear business and more than $6 billion in liabilities.




TEPCO’s fourth release of Fukushima treated water slated for February

about 1 km offshore through an undersea tunnel.
•  The same amount will be released for a 5th and 6th time, some time after April.
•  CONTEXT: Since August, TEPCO has carried out three discharges, totalling about 23,400 tons of
treated water. The entire discharge will only be completed around 2051.




TEPCO, NTT Data to form JV for data center in Chiba Pref

(Company statement, Dec 19)
•  TEPCO Power Grid, NTT Data Group and NTT Global Data Centers Japan will form a JV to build a
50 MW data center complex in the Inzai Shiroi area in Chiba Pref and start operation in 2026-2027.

license from the Vietnamese govt to develop a $1.99 billion LNG-fired power plant in the province
of Thai Bin. The proposed capacity is 1.5 GW.
•  According to a statement by the govt of Vietnam, the license was awarded to the JV during the
Japan-ASEAN summit in Tokyo.
•  CONTEXT: Vietnam became an LNG importer this year. In October, PetroVietnam Gas, a unit of
state-owned PetroVietnam, launched its Thi Vai LNG import terminal, the country’s first such

facility. It consists of one 180,000-cbm LNG tank, a jetty, and regas area. The terminal has a
capacity of 1 mtpa in its first phase, but PetroVietnam Gas plans to boost the capacity to 3 mtpa in
the next stage. The country is planning to develop up to 13 LNG power plants with a combined
capacity of 22.4 GW by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: Currently, no LNG-fired power plants operate in Vietnam. It’s important to remember that
awarding an investment certificate is only the first step. The issue of financing is still unclear and the project’s

success will depend on whether it can secure a power purchase agreement from state utility Vietnam
Electricity.

ANALYSIS

BY JAPAN NRG TEAM

2023: Summary of the Year Across Key Energy Sectors

In comparison with the energy crisis and associated turbulence of 2022, this year has
been about preparation for the future for most major energy sectors. As one industry
insider joked, everyone’s favorite word this year was “MoU”. Likewise, “pilot”, “test”,
“explore”, “consider” and “study” filled almost every issue of Japan NRG, reflecting
the preparatory phase of technologies such as CCS, hydrogen and ammonia fuels,
SAF, and Perovskite solar cells (PSC).

More advanced energy sources, such as batteries and biofuels, made greater
advances, though also at a cautious pace. The renewables complex in general had a
tough time in Japan as solar’s breakneck rollout over the past decade noticeably
slowed, partly due to land and cost issues, as well as a more complex regulatory and
fiscal environment. Wind power saw a slew of major onshore projects canceled over
community opposition, but Japan finally took big steps forward in developing offshore
resources.

The lull in the ideological debates over the meaning and means of the energy
transition helped fossil fuels recover policy and investor interest, especially in natural
gas and LNG. But the net-zero battle lines will be drawn anew in 2024 as METI begins
updating the Basic (Strategic) Energy Plan. All stakeholders will be keen to see their
imprint in the national vision for 2030 (or will this now be 2035…?).

More than vision, however, most of the energy sectors will be looking for investment,
and 2024 is expected to deliver on a lot of large-scale commitments that will carry
Japan’s energy sector to the end of this decade and beyond. Developers and end
users involved with hydrogen and ammonia in particular have great expectations for
funding from the government and private sources. But significant financing is also
expected in the battery storage / BESS space, in carbon capture, and of course in
(floating) offshore wind. The government’s maiden GX Economic Transition bonds
should open the floodgates to a much broader wave of capital-raising by both
startups and blue chips.


Below we look back at some of 2023’s key events in the major energy sectors.

HYDROGEN / AMMONIA
In 2023, solar-derived green hydrogen traded close to ¥10,000/ nm3, a far cry from
the 2030 government cost target of ¥30/ nm3. Yet, a real-world business case kicked
off in Kawasaki City. Resonac, which has been producing ammonia from plastic waste
and natural gas since 2003, started commercial supply of “semi-green” hydrogen to
users in the area, transporting the gas through underground pipes installed decades
ago for petrochemical plants. The pipelines eliminated the need for the gas to be
chilled to minus 253 Celsius for transportation on land and cut costs.

Businesses testing hydrogen ideas are emerging, thanks to the enactment of the
Green Transformation (GX) Act which gave METI the capacity to subsidize projects. In
July, the Hydrogen and Ammonia Division was newly created in ANRE to write
18



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

subsidy policies and measures to push a shift to green hydrogen. In December, the
division released the project criteria: meeting requirements for safety, energy security,
environmental, and economic efficiency (S+3E).

The environment part of the S+3E philosophy was more elaborately addressed in the
second version of the Basic Hydrogen Strategy, published in June, which was the
document’s first update since its initial release in 2017. The strategy stated that
hydrogen means “low-carbon” hydrogen, not just any hydrogen. It added a new goal
to expand the water electrolyzer capacity to 15 GW by 2030 from the present 13 MW.

On the ammonia front, JERA started an ammonia-coal co-firing demo at the Hekinan
No. 4 plant in fall. The ammonia ratio will be raised to 20% by March 2024, before
moving into commercial operation before 2030. In October, JGC Holdings and Asahi
Kasei started construction of the first commercial-level green ammonia plant in
Fukushima Prefecture.

SOLAR
It’s easy to focus on the negatives in the sector, and there have been plenty. The
“uprising” of northern governors keen to slap a new tax on renewables projects to
supplement local funds is expected to slim the project pipeline by as much as a
quarter. But there are plenty of positives for the industry.

Recent solar auctions delivered the first sub ¥8/ kWh bid in the country. In a late
December 2020 issue, Japan NRG Weekly highlighted a NEDO goal to have solar
costs drop to ¥7/ kWh by 2025, in part due to innovation in crystalline silicon, CIS
(Copper Indium Selenide), and Perovskite solar cells (PSC). Not all of the technologies
covered in that issue have blossomed, but the ¥7 target, then seen as laughable, is no
longer a joke.


Of course, not all projects can rely on a superfluous golf course for land, but
developers are starting to get more creative with access and cost solutions. Rail
companies are offering space along their lines for solar PV in return for sourcing green
electricity. More industrial complexes are open to both onsite and offsite PPAs. And
while the agrisolar and floating sectors remain difficult niches in Japan, there’s been a
surge in enthusiasm around building-integrated solar.

In fact, the strides made by domestic PSC developers, and the government’s
willingness to elevate the technology to a priority field, shows that the state of the
solar market will change rapidly this decade. Inserting light, flexible PSC cells in
constructions and even on car bodies will offer a way to bring energy closer to
consumers – and likely enable them to take greater control and responsibility for their
electricity supply and emissions footprint.

Of course, PSC’s development is unlikely to be smooth, but it offers another branch
for the solar sector’s growth, in addition to rooftop solar PV, an area that’s finally
getting stronger regulatory support and government purchasing orders.

WIND
Over 500 MW of onshore wind capacity was canceled or shelved indefinitely in the
last six months due to the eruption of local community or government concerns about

19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

environmental impact. That has fed into an unfortunate narrative in the media that
many operators are poor planners or don’t communicate enough with residents. In
fact, Japan NRG conversations with local officials suggest there was plenty of time and
effort invested by companies. For all that, sometimes a community isn’t going to
budge anyway.

The trouble with onshore projects will put the onus back on the national government
to find land where developments may be more welcome. As we reported earlier this
year, the MoE’s campaign to get towns and cities to designate zones for new solar
and wind projects has stalled, largely due to a lack of resources at the local level.

At some point, however, ministerial task forces set up to solve such issues will need to
deliver. Japan’s signature on the COP28 goal to help triple renewables (globally)
within this decade will provide plenty of fuel for environmental groups to prod the
authorities into action.

Meanwhile, earlier this month the industry celebrated the results of the Round 2
auction for fixed bottom offshore wind projects. Despite the proliferation of winning
parties in comparison with Round 1, clearly a number of firms also lost out. Still,
there’s one more project result due in March and the Round 3 auction will start
shortly. The sector is in its infancy in Japan and near-term opportunities far outweigh
the challenges and frustrations.

Some companies that did not enter the Round 2 auction, or did and lost out, admit
that while winning would have been welcomed, it was also a relief…? There are a
number of engineering and community nuances that Round 2 winners will now need
to navigate.


One thing that many in the sector will agree on, though, is that the future of wind
projects will be intricately linked with finding anchor clients for offtake. Understanding
of power markets will also be an important factor for future profits, but to compile a
competitive bid and sell it to investors, developers will need a solid PPA or similar with
a large user or two.

BATTERIES
The fact that Japan’s power grid demands such a high level of curtailment of solar and
wind projects is the best business argument for installing more battery storage. That’s
the motivation behind companies like Gurin Energy and Akaysha Energy,
headquartered in Singapore and Australia, respectively, to enter the Japanese market.

The number of battery developers has proliferated this year, and not only in
Hokkaido, which initially experienced a rush of applications for new storage battery
sites. Many non-utility firms are also involved, with trading house Itochu one of the
most prominent domestic players.

What divides the market players, however, are considerations around the business
model. Most opt for government subsidies and see them as crucial to project success.
A minority trust in their ability to trade the power in the markets, pointing to the rapid
tempos of growth in both the physical and derivative electricity contracts.

Electricity futures trading in Japan hit close to 0.5 TWh in a single day earlier this
month. Trading platforms are also updating their processes, rolling out more short-
term products, such as daily contracts, and cooperating with analytics and data firms
to attract more liquidity and players to the market from inside and outside of Japan.

Of course, another concern shared by battery players is where and at what cost they’ll
be able to secure the actual equipment. Material and other costs across the battery
supply chain have distorted the downward cost trend of the past decade. However,
this situation should ease in 2024-25, not least because Japanese manufacturers seek
to bolster their offering and grab a bigger market share. GX funding should help to
make domestic battery production more competitive.

NUCLEAR
The sector made massive strides this year in terms of policy and public appeal. COP28
saw the signing of a declaration by over 22 countries, including Japan, to aspire to
tripling nuclear power capacity by 2050. Public opinion polls in Japan not only
continue to provide majority approval for using nuclear energy, but the release of
treated water at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP did not raise much public objection. Two-
thirds of those surveyed in Japan about the release said they understand the need for
it and tacitly approve.

The sentiment is favorable for nuclear, but what does this mean in practice? Last
summer, PM Kishida promised the restart of up to 17 reactors. A year on, 12 reactors
have actually restarted, but due to the need for regular maintenance and safety
checks, only eight units are operating.

In the next 12-18 months, another two to three units are expected to restart. But the
real litmus test of the industry’s revival is not the absolute number – it is whether
TEPCO will be able to restart the units at its only operable facility, the Kashiwazaki
Kariwa NPP, and whether any of the stations north of Tokyo are given a green light
(from both regulators and local officials). TEPCO’s multiple blunders over personnel,
security, maintenance procedures, etc have kept Kashiwazaki Kariwa offline since
March 2012. Some of its units have not worked in 16 years. Today, a whole generation
of TEPCO nuclear staff have no experience of being in an operational NPP.


The problem for TEPCO may be that Tokyo and the surrounding Kanto area are no
longer as short of power capacity as they were in recent years. How soon it can turn at
least one reactor back on will determine how much of that NPP will remain a “going
concern”. Recent signals from the NRA suggest that their approval at least is edging
closer. This will likely be a closely followed topic in 2024.

As far as new NPPs, everything remains on a very distant horizon. Since the
publication of the industry roadmap, a few basic computer drawings of reactor
designs have appeared in the media but nothing more. According to some in the
startup community, there’s more chance of Japan building a new fusion reactor than
one based on nuclear fission. And so, Japanese nuclear vendors will look to overseas
contracts to sustain them, though at this point it’s hard to see which market they can
penetrate.

LNG
China seems to have re-emerged as the top global LNG importer this year. Japan’s
import volumes, on the other hand, have plummeted by over 10%, based on data
from the first 10 months of 2023. In part, this is the effect of milder weather and the
uptick in renewable energy production, but also the restart of a few more nuclear
reactors. Also, renewables now account for close to 22% of the electricity mix in
Japan.

The decline of LNG volumes, however, is not all about the weather or other energy
sources. For the main buyers – the EPCOs – LNG has simply become too much of a
risk. In addition to the chance of non-delivery due to geopolitical tensions, typhoons
or delays at major choke points such as the Panama Canal, the utilities have to
contend with ever greater uncertainty in power demand and prices.

LNG cargoes cost hundreds of millions of USD and require months of planning and
negotiations with sellers, shippers, storage facilities and more. Add to this the
uncertainties over gas demand due to decarbonization and it’s clear why Japanese
utilities have now reduced their LNG purchases to below pre-Fukushima levels.

The trend worries Japan’s energy planners. For one, utilities are not always turning to
CO2-free sources to compensate for gas, with coal a frequent beneficiary. Also, a
number of existing long-term LNG supply contracts are due to run out in the next few
years, which would leave Japan relying on the volatile spot market to plug the gap.
Historically, Japan has bought over 80% of its LNG via long-term deals, which
protected the country from the worst excesses of fossil fuel price spikes during
2021/22.

The future of Russian LNG supply, which still makes up close to 10% of Japan’s total,
seems at the mercy of decisions made outside Japanese shores.

Thus, to make Japanese LNG buyers more comfortable with new long-term deals, the
government has created a strategic fuel buffer. In effect, state-run JOGMEC agrees to
buy “surplus” LNG cargoes from importers in case demand wanes below
expectations. At present, this covers only one cargo a month, but officials say this will
be expanded. Similarly, Japan has proposed to the International Energy Agency (IEA)
to set up an international LNG reserve to create supply stability and security in times
of crises. The proposal is up for review at the IEA ministerial meeting in February
2024.


These subtle initiatives to create a backup network for LNG to counter the fuel’s
occasional logistical and other challenges is seen as a way to support the sector's
expansion to new markets, such as in Southeast Asia. Tokyo Gas’s recent JV with
PetroVietnam Gas to develop the LNG industry in Vietnam is just the latest example of
the strategy.

To feed the belief in LNG’s longevity as a transition fuel, METI may consider revising
up its share in the 2030/35 energy mix of Japan when the latest edition of the Basic
Energy Plan is drawn up next year.

COAL
When PM Kishida announced a gradual phase-out of Russian coal imports in 2022, no
specific timeline was stated. Before the conflict in Ukraine, Russia was Japan’s third-
largest supplier of thermal coal, accounting for around 12% of its total. By the end of
2023, Russia's share in the fuel decreased to just below 3%, making it Japan’s fifth-
largest supplier.

Australia remained Japan’s top coal provider, consistently accounting for 65% of total
imports. But Australian coal is not cheap; the nation’s benchmark reached a record
high of over $400/ton in autumn 2022. Since then, prices for thermal coal have
cooled, reaching $180/ton in early spring 2023 and more recently, it has traded
around $120/ton (November) to around $140/ton (early December).

The end of the year is anticipated to bring the highest imports of thermal coal since
March. Japan is set to import over 10 million tons to cover winter heating demand,
with around 6.9 million tons coming from Australia. Meanwhile, Kishida stated at
COP28 that Japan will stop building new coal power plants that do not have
emissions reduction measures.

Since about 70% of Japan's electricity still comes from fossil fuels, and the country has
no way to store natural gas for longer than a few weeks, the government is unlikely to
authorize an exit from coal any time soon. Alternatives will need to tick all the “S+3E”
principles mentioned in the hydrogen section. So, for now, it’s more likely that Japan
will reshuffle its portfolio of importers, seeking to add suppliers from exporters such as
Indonesia and reduce the reliance on Australia.

The key to what happens next lies in ammonia and carbon capture / CCS.


CARBON CAPTURE & STORAGE (CCS)
The year started with Japan’s CCS roadmap targeting the storage of 6-12 mtpa of
CO2 by 2030. JOGMEC identified five domestic sites and two abroad for national
CCS development, with a focus on storing about 13 mtpa of CO2 from these in total.
Looking further ahead, Japan has set sights on finding locations (at home and abroad)
to store 120-240 mtpa by 2050.

Among the projects supported by JOGMEC, there are notable collaborations in
Tomakomai that focus on creating a hub for CCS and CO2 reuse. In western Kyushu,
ENEOS, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration, and J-Power aim to get the nod for CO2
storage by 2030. In the Tohoku region, Itochu, MHI and others are working on a
scalable project that would serve the needs of steel and cement industries, among
others.

Internationally, Japan's CCS initiatives extend to Southeast Asia and beyond. It signed
accords with Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, focusing on CCS/CCUS development
and exploration. Under JOGMEC’s banner, Mitsui is working on transporting CO2
from Japan to Malaysia. Mitsubishi, Nippon Steel and ExxonMobil are working on
transportation to Oceania.

Such efforts are part of a strategy to create a broad Asia-Pacific CCS market, which
would address the needs of a region still heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Still, economic viability and a lack of regulations linger over CCS development. To
address this, the CCS Business Act drafted by METI is promised to enter the Diet early
in 2024. Developers will also want to hear more about subsidy terms and the potential
to link their operations with Japan’s burgeoning carbon credit market. The latter
started in trial mode earlier this year but is not expected to be in full operational
mode until at least 2026.

HONORABLE MENTIONS
In addition to the above, there have been a number of key developments in biofuels
(example: SAF to make up 10% of all domestic airline fuel in Japan by 2030); there is
tentative progress with synthetic fuels and e-methane (hats off to producer Santos in
Australia on a flurry of deals with Japanese gas players); sustainability principles are
transforming textiles and other materials; and hydro power plants are tapping into AI
to improve their efficiency.

All these developments have made 2023 much more than just a year of preparing for
the energy transition. Undoubtedly, bigger changes are yet to come. We hope you’ll
continue to join us in reading and learning about Japan’s energy sector in 2024!

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that directly impacts markets
in the region.

China / Coal investments
Financial institutions arranged about $120 billion for coal projects last year, reports
Bloomberg. China garnered 76% of the total coal financing, or $93 billion. The U.S.
was a distant second at $10 billion

China / Critical metals
China, the world's top processor of rare earths, banned export of technology to
extract and separate these critical metals, thereby protecting its dominance over
strategic metals. Rare earths are a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn
power into motion for use in EVs, wind turbines and electronics.

China / Wind power
Sembcorp Industries acquired Qinzhou Yuanneng Wind Power that operates 200 MW
of wind assets in Guangxi. The company now has renewables capacity of 12.6 GW
comprising solar, wind, and energy storage assets.

India / Battery storage
In 2023, the govt awarded tenders of more than 8 GW of grid-scale battery storage,
reports the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The govt estimates
it needs about 42 GW of BESS and 19 GW of pumped hydro storage capacity by
2030.

Indonesia / Natural gas
The UAE’s Mubadala Energy discovered a major deep sea gas reserve in Indonesia's
South Andaman Block, believed to be the world's second-largest deep-water
discovery this year, with potential gas-in-place for more than 6 trillion cubic feet (tcf).

North Korea / Nuclear power
A new reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex appears to be operating for the first
time, said the U.N. nuclear watchdog. North Korea has for years used spent fuel from
a 5 MW nuclear reactor at Yongbyon to produce plutonium for its nuclear arsenal.

Philippines / Renewable energy
Aboitiz Power expanded its clean energy portfolio to 4.6 GW, including 1 GW in the
pipeline. It also commissioned new energy projects with a 1 GW capacity from solar,
hydro, geothermal, wind, and energy storage systems.

Philippines / Energy exploration
The country seeks to resolve geopolitical issues in the South China Sea so it can start
new energy exploration. The govt said tensions in the South China Sea have increased
rather than diminished in recent months, warning that a "more assertive China" posed
a "real challenge" to its Asian neighbors.

Qatar / LNG deals
QatarEnergy expects to ink more long-term LNG supply deals in Asia and Europe,
with several imminent. In past months, the company signed a number of supply deals
with European and Asian partners for its North Field expansion project that’s
expected to produce 126 mtpa of LNG by 2027, up from 77 mtpa now

South Korea / Renewable energy
Amazon is investing in its first renewable energy project in South Korea with about 60
MW capacity. The company’s goal is to power operations with 100% renewable
energy by 2025.
