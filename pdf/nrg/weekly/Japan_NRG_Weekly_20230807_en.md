Tokyo Gas leads Japan’s first regional e-methane production trial via CCU
(Company Statements, Denki Shimbun, July 31)
•  Tokyo Gas, MHI and Yokohama City began a carbon capture and utilization demo. The goal is to
produce synthetic methane (e-methane) by utilizing CO2 recovered from a waste incineration plant

in Yokohama's Tsurumi Ward.
•  CO2 is separated and recovered from the exhaust of Yokohama City Resource Circulation Bureau's
waste incinerator. The recovered CO2 is then compressed and sent to Tokyo Gas' Yokohama
Techno Station, where it’s combined with hydrogen to produce e-methane.
•  The project utilizes a small to medium-sized CO2 recovery device developed by MHI.
•  The system has capacity to recover 200 kilograms of CO2 daily, generating 50 to 100 cubic meters

of synthetic methane.
•  CONTEXT: This marks the fifth installation of such a device and the first in a waste incinerator
plant. It is the first “regional” project in Japan to produce e-methane, meaning the CO2 is
captured in one area but then moved to a different area for production and use, according to the
firms involved.



ENEOS, Idemitsu, and Saudi Aramco ink MoU on e-fuel

(Company statement, Aug 2)

NEWS:     POWER       MARKETS






Electricity surveillance committee to abolish ‘gross bidding’
(Denki Shimbun, July 31)
•  The Electricity and Gas Trading Supervisory Committee will terminate "gross bidding" on the spot
market, where former electricity providers had to offer volumes in wholesale power trading –
including for internal transactions.
•  As of March this year, the spot market accounted for 38.4% of Japan’s electricity sales. Of that,

6.2% came from gross bidding, which started in April 2017 and was applied nationwide, apart from
in Okinawa.
•  CONTEXT: The primary goals of gross bidding were to enhance market liquidity, manage price
volatility, and improve transparency. While these aims were recognized as already accomplished as
early as in 2021, the supervisory committee said at the recent meeting in July 2023 that further
improvement in transparency around internal transactions at power utilities was needed.
•  To assess the impact on the spot market, the system will be suspended from October, with full

abolition planned if no issues arise.



Round 3 offshore wind projects will be in Aomori and Yamagata
(Nikkei, Aug 1)
•  METI will add two new areas for Round 3 offshore wind projects – Aomori and Yamagata Prefs. The

generation capacity will exceed 1 GW. Bidding starts later this year.
•  In Aomori, METI nominated the Japan Sea side or western shore of the prefecture, for 600 MW of
generation capacity. In Yamagata, it is expected to generate 450 MW.
•  CONTEXT: By 2030, the govt plans to generate 5.7 GW of electricity from offshore wind. So far,
after Round 1 and 2 of the auctions, a total of 3.53 GW from offshore wind has been planned.
Round 3 will add another 1.05 GW. Altogether, it will yield 80% of the 5.7 GW target.




Lawmaker Akimoto under probe for alleged wind power bribery
(Japan NRG, Aug 4)
•  Ruling party lawmaker Akimoto Masatoshi resigned as Parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister
following Tokyo prosecutors' raid of his offices for alleged bribery in wind power businesses.
Akimoto has allegedly received financial contributions from Japan Wind Development Co.
•  METI Minister Nishimura said while he recognizes that Akimoto was involved in the 2022 revision

of offshore wind auction rules, the rule changes were unbiased.
•  A JWD lawyer commented: “The allegation that JWD has bribed lawmakers and public officials is
unfounded. Financial flows resulted because Akimoto and the JWD president were joint owners of
a race horse.”

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: JWD is believed to have participated in the 2021 Round 1 offshore wind auctions, but
these were all won by a Mitsubishi consortium. The landslide win provoked complaints and since
then drove changes in auction rules.
• TAKEAWAY: JWD is believed to have placed a bid for the 356 MW Happo Cho/Noshiro offshore wind auction
whose results will be announced before April 2024. METI did not respond to Japan NRG’s query whether

companies charged with corruption will be disqualified. Some govt tenders restrict participation from
companies charged with violating the antitrust law.

The auction guidelines state:

Auction participants are disqualified on the Violation of the Electricity Business Act, or the Act on
condition of:               Special Measures to Procure Renewable Sources
Bankruptcy

Subject to sanctions by METI, MLIT and/or local
municipalities for cartel and other relevant charges.

Non-payment of corporate taxes

EPCOs post record profits for April-June 2023 period
(Mainichi Shimbun, Aug 3)
•  Consolidated financial results of Japan's top 10 electric power companies (EPCOs) in the April-
June period show record profits for eight of them; this is a stark contrast to the previous year.
•  The improved performance was attributed to a decrease in fuel price increases and regulated fee

hikes for many households. Kansai and Kyushu Electric showed improved performance due to
higher nuclear power plant operational rates.
•  Seven other companies raised regulated fees in June after receiving METI approval. TEPCO
reported a profit of ¥136.2 billion, thanks in part to fee increases in June.

KEPCO considers building nuclear fuel storage facility with Chugoku Electric
(Nikkei, Aug 2)
•  Kansai Electric intends to review the possibility of building an interim storage facility for spent
nuclear fuel in Yamaguchi Pref, together with Chugoku Electric.

•  CONTEXT: In 1994, Japan set a policy to store spent fuel on the site of existing NPPs with the idea
that the fuel rods would then be processed domestically. However, the then-Governor of Fukui
Pref – which hosts all of Kansai Electric’s NPPs – opposed this plan and requested that spent fuel
rods be moved outside of Fukui. This set in motion plans to create a new interim storage facility
outside Fukui.
•  KEPCO wants to build the new interim storage facility in Yamauchi, but delays and local opposition

have made the process difficult so far. In June, KEPCO announced plans to send 200 tons of spent
fuel from its Takahama NPP to France, but no final decision on this was announced.
•  Chugoku Electric has one operational reactor. KEPCO has seven.
• TAKEAWAY: KEPCO’s utilization rates for spent fuel pools are high, and it’s estimated that it may run out of
storage at its NPPs in the next five to seven years. KEPCO began operation of Unit 1 of Takahama NPP on July
28, and Unit 2 is set to restart in September; thus the need to resolve the issue is as pressing as ever. Given
the difficulties in gaining local consensus, it’s likely that KEPCO will have to rely on sending the spent fuel

abroad for processing to reduce stockpiles, at least for the foreseeable future.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
City in Nagasaki Pref mulls raising hand for nuclear waste storage site

(Denki Shimbun, Aug 3)
o  Officials from ANRE met with the Tsushima City Council (Nagasaki Pref) to discuss the
municipality’s potential interest in raising its hand to host the nation’s long-term nuclear
waste storage facility.
o  The first step of the selection process, should the City decide to self-nominate, will be a
so-called literature survey. ANRE officials noted that this step does not directly lead to
the establishment of the radioactive waste disposal site, and reassured the City that no

progress would be made without agreement from local governors and mayors.
o  The City has received petitions from both sides of the debate. Hosting storage would
bring economic benefits. However, some worry about the City’s potential proximity to
geological fault lines.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has not yet found a site to store its long-term nuclear waste. So far, two small
municipalities in Hokkaido have raised their hand to accept the first-stage literature survey. Allowing this survey
alone brings economic benefit to the locality, but it is only the first of many steps towards creating a storage

site. The Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NUMO) is in charge of finding a site and then maintaining
it. NUMO is also holding various meetings around Japan, trying to explain the reasons why such a storage
facility is needed, why it can be operated safely, and what benefits a locality would get by hosting it.

Japan to develop African supply chains for critical minerals and EV batteries
(Nikkei Asia, Aug 2)
•  Japan plans to collaborate with Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Namibia to
develop supply chains for cobalt and other critical minerals used in EV batteries. This move is
aimed at diversifying Japan's sources of essential minerals, including lithium, and countering
China's increasing investment in Africa.

•  JOGMEC will sign an MoU with Zambia and finalize plans with Congo and Namibia. Japan intends
to explore African countries and provide remote sensing technology to identify potential mining
sites using satellite imagery.
•  In Congo, the focus will be on copper and lithium. In Namibia, the goal is to reinforce the supply
chain for rare earths and other minerals.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese interest in African mining resurged in the 2010s due to demand for

steelmaking materials. In recent years, the strategic focus of Japanese raw material investments has
shifted to batteries. However, African countries are more likely to assert national ownership of
mines. While China persevered despite losses, Japan has been more cautious towards the African
mining community.
• TAKEAWAY: Politics and business are interconnected in Africa; infrastructure development is crucial for mining
economies, requiring collaboration among multiple companies. Transparency is essential for Japanese
investments in order to avoid selling metal products below market prices due to child labor concerns. Also,

Japanese companies' conservative approach might present challenges in forming long-term partnerships for
high-risk projects.

METI Certifies 7 Projects to Secure Rechargeable Battery Supply

Last year, METI unveiled a Battery Industry Strategy, Japan’s first detailed battery
industry roadmap in a long time. The Strategy was a grand vision, outlining how a
focus on lithium-ion chemistry and the all-solid-state technologies can propel
Japanese firms to expand their capacity over the course of this decade and capture as
much as 20% of the global market.

To move the Strategy forward, METI vowed to invest in new battery R&D along with
private companies, helping Japanese manufacturers not only to create the
technologies but also build the production facilities, train new talent, and forge global
raw material supply chains.

As one of the first steps in this process, the government has now certified a wave of
domestic projects that will receive initial backing; the certifications are split into two
rounds. On June 16, METI confirmed the first seven projects that it believes can help
industry provide a stable supply of rechargeable batteries. Subsidies totalling ¥127
billion will be distributed to support the production and technological development of
batteries and their components.
Among the companies winning support is Toyota, whose initiative aims to set up 25
GWh of battery production capacity. Altogether, the certified projects are expected to
boost domestic battery output to 45 GWh.


Background
METI’s Battery Industry Strategy estimated that Japan needs ¥3.4 trillion in both
public and private investment to develop a manufacturing base for EV and storage
batteries. A specialist panel tasked with formulating battery strategy has set targets
for domestic production capacity of EV and energy storage batteries to reach 150
GWh by 2030, and for global capacity of Japanese makers to hit 600 GWh. It has also
called for a full-scale commercialisation of all-solid-state batteries by 2030.

Such ambitious goals will also require vast natural resources. An annual production
level of 600 GWh would utilize about 380,000 tons of lithium, 310,000 tons of nickel,
60,000 tons of cobalt, 600,000 tons of graphite and 50,000 tons of manganese,
according to government estimates. Such figures will demand vast mining
investments. For context, the world mined just 130,000 tons of lithium last year and
produces only 1.3 million tons of graphite today.


The seven samurai
Toyota Motor Corp, in collaboration with Prime Planet Energy & Solutions, Prime
Earth EV Energy, and Toyota Industries, plans to manufacture batteries for electric
vehicles (EVs), such as onboard batteries, new structure batteries, and next-generation
onboard batteries. Annual production capacity is expected to hit 25 GWh and will
begin sequentially after October 2026. The project's cost is about ¥330 billion, with
METI providing about ¥118 billion in subsidies.

Tokai Carbon will establish a supply system for negative electrode active materials
with an annual capacity of 5 GWh, starting its supply in April 2026. The project cost is
about ¥3.7 billion, with about ¥1.3 billion coming from subsidies.

Kanto Denka Kogyo will develop the capacity to produce 65 GWh worth of electrolyte
additives annually, starting its supply in October 2025. The project cost is about ¥4.6
billion, with about ¥1.5 billion in subsidies.
Ube Maxell Kyoto will start production of coating-type separators with an annual
capacity of 5 GWh from June 2026. The project cost is about ¥2.7 billion, with ¥900
million in subsidies.

Nisshin Kogyo will establish a production base for positive and negative current
collectors and external materials. The positive electrode current collector capacity will
be 24 GWh annually, and the negative electrode current collector capacity will be 40
GWh annually; both should begin supply in October 2025. The project cost is about
¥2.5 billion, with subsidies of about ¥1 billion.
Denka will go ahead with the development and improvement of production
technologies for conductive additives. The project cost is about ¥6.7 billion, with
subsidies of ¥3.3 billion.

Aisan Industry will establish a production base for cell cases and cell covers. Annual
production capacity will be 15.2 GWh for cell cases and 16.5 GWh for cell covers, with
both supplies expected to begin in January 2026. The project cost is about ¥5.3
billion, with subsidies of about ¥1.8 billion.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Brazil/ Solar power
Portuguese power company EDP plans to invest $478 million in distributed solar
energy generation plants in Brazil with 530 MW total capacity, focusing on "remote
shared generation". Distributed generation has driven growth of solar energy in Brazil,
already reaching 20 GW.

Canada/ Oil
Oil producer Strathcona Resources will go public by acquiring rival Pipestone Energy
in an all-stock deal to create a business with a market cap of C$8.6 billion. The
combined company will retain its name and be led by its CEO Rob Morgan. It did not
say when Strathcona plans to start trading in Toronto.

China/ Mining and metals
In the first half of this year, Chinese investments and new contracts in mining and
metals — nickel, lithium and copper, as well as uranium, steel and iron — topped $10
billion. That’s more than the 2022 full-year total, and will exceed the previous record
of $17 billion in 2018.

China/ Nuclear power
China approved construction of six nuclear power units – Units 5 and 6 of Ningde
NPP; Units 1 and 2 of Shidaowan NPP; and Units 1 and 2 of Xudabao NPP. Investment
totals $17 billion. China has the world’s third-largest nuclear fleet behind France and
the U.S., and accounts for 23 of the 55 reactors now under construction globally.

Niger/ Uranium
Turmoil in Niger has only led to a slight uptick in the spot price for uranium, to $56.25
a pound. Niger is the world’s seventh largest producer, with a market share of about
5% of the global uranium trade. Niger has cut off supplies to France. Between 2005
and 2020, Niger supplied France with around 18% of its uranium.

Saudi Arabia/ Oil production
Saudi Arabia will extend a 1 mbpd voluntary crude output cut into September, the
third month of such a decline. Saudi production for September will be about 9 mbpd.
This adds to 1.66 mbpd of production cuts by other OPEC members planned through
the end of 2024.

Turkmenistan / Natural gas
The country’s proposal to build a multibillion-dollar gas pipeline across the Caspian
Sea faces major financing challenges, reports Bloomberg. Currently, there are no
international discussions or contacts with Turkmenistan concerning future gas exports.
This will make it difficult to get the Trans-Caspian pipeline off the ground.

UAE/ Net zero
State-owned ADNOC has brought forward emissions reduction targets as the UAE
prepares to host COP28 in December. The UAE will now aim to achieve net zero
emissions from operations by 2045 rather than 2050, and cut methane emissions to
zero by 2030.

U.S./ LNG
LNG exports rebounded in July with a 9% jump from the previous month, as a number
of plants along the Mexican Gulf coast resumed operations after planned
maintenance.

U.S./ Oil
The White House nixed an offer to buy 6 million barrels of oil for the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, because prices are expected to keep rising after an output cut
from Saudi Arabia. The U.S. made the latest solicitation to buy the crude for the SPR
on July 7.
