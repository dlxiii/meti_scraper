NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Japan leads 100 Asian companies to jointly develop carbon storage industry

(Nikkei, METI statement, June 22)
•  Japan launched an Asia-wide public-private initiative to develop carbon storage technology, and
over 100 companies in the region agreed to take part.
•  The goal of the Asia CCUS Network, according to METI, is to lower the cost of the technology and
bring it closer to commercial reality. This should create a forum to swap technological know-how
with companies from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Australia and the U.S. The first
meeting will be in August, with financing also due to be discussed.
•  Studies show the CCUS requires investment of over $1 billion annually.

•  From Japan, leading members include INPEX, Mitsubishi Corp, Sumitomo Corp., Tokyo Gas,
Mitsui OSK (MOL), Nippon Steel, JGC and MUFG Bank.
•  Asia has the geology to create underground storage for at least 10 billion tons of CO2. Annually,
the region could see 35 million tons of CO2 captured by 2030, which would grow to 200 million
tons by 2050. The gas would be collected at emissions point, liquified, and then shipped to
storage location.
•  One of the first projects will be in Indonesia, where Japanese firms are preparing a feasibility study

to collect CO2 from gas fields. About 300,000 tons of CO2 might be removed, to count towards
Japan’s CO2 reduction targets.
•  There are currently no commercial scale CCUS projects in Southeast Asia.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mitsubishi licenses CO2 recovery technology to Drax

(New Energy Business News, June 22)
o  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Engineering inked an agreement with UK utility Drax for use
of its proprietary CO2 recovery technology at biomass-fired power stations in north
Yorkshire with a total capacity of 2.6 GW, in what’s known as a Bio Energy with Carbon
dioxide Capture and Storage, or BECCS, project.
o  By combining carbon-neutral, plant-based fuels with CO2 recovery, the project aims to
create the world’s first commercial scale “negative emission” plant.

o  This is Drax’s first foray into BECCS; the company hopes to have a negative carbon
emissions profile by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: Carbon Capture (and Storage or Recycle) figures very highly on the priority list for energy
transition of Japan and many other governments. Japan has decided that it can and must take the lead on
carbon capture and there is no better market for its energy tech than Southeast Asia and the wider Pacific
region. It’s not clear how seriously technological development will proceed within such a large and largely
corporate network. However, the Asia CCUS Network could act as an alliance for lobbying in favor of the

technology’s introduction and widespread adoption. It may also help Japan stay on top of the regional
development and build up a power base for CCUS in Asia to compete with similar technology from the U.S.,
Europe and elsewhere.



METI group reveals energy transition roadmap for power, steel sectors
(Japan NRG, June 22)

•  On June 22, a METI working group on energy transition presented roadmaps to replace fossil fuel
with ammonia and hydrogen in the power and steel sectors. The roadmap is for 2021-2030.
•  Ammonia is seen as the ideal replacement for coal at power plants since it allows utilities to retain
existing facilities. Carbon could be cut 10% if USC coal-fired power plants, which account for 57%
of Japan’s coal power plants, used ammonia as 20% of their feedstock.

•  Hydrogen is seen replacing coking coal as an iron ore reduction agent used in steel blast furnaces.
•  While the greater share of Japan’s ammonia demand – estimated to be 3 million tons/ year by
2030 – will be imported, Japan is also exploring alternative production technologies for both blue
and green ammonia. R&D has started on manufacturing ammonia at normal temperature and
pressure conditions, which would replace the conventional Haber Bosche process.
•  Work is also underway to discover new catalysts such as molybdenum, used in oil refining, that

could be used in the green ammonia manufacture process.
•  Another major R&D focus is reducing nitrogen compounds during the combustion process, as well
as establishing a practical way to transport and store large volumes of ammonia safely and
economically.
•  Japan expects to start moving into ammonia combustion at its power plants in around 2023 to
2024. Development of new catalysts for blue ammonia should take till 2023, with a test phase seen
from 2024 and then pilot testing from 2027. Green ammonia development may follow a similar

timescale.
• TAKEAWAY: Progress towards a shift from coal to gas (ammonia or hydrogen) is happening much faster than
was imagined by most a year ago. Steelmakers are already testing hydrogen reduction technology with small
pilot furnaces — see Japan NRG Weekly’s June 21 issue for details. Still, commercial and mass-scale rollout of
these technologies is years away. Commercial scale operations of hydrogen steelmaking, for example, are not
expected until around 2030. In the power sector, ammonia/hydrogen is unlikely to offer more than 1% to 2%
of the total energy mix by the end of this decade, but will likely ramp up quickly after that.




METI tells renewables to brace for tightening power supplies
(Japan NRG, June 21)
•  On June 21, METI sent a notice to renewable energy operators urging them to brace for a tighter
power supply balance in upcoming peak-demand seasons.
•  The ministry believes that power shortage concerns have eased after the restart of the Mihama

NPP plant last week, but METI’s message is that the renewables sector still needs to stay alert.
•  CONTEXT: Many electricity retailers source power from spot or wholesale markets. A lot of these
new retailers are also primarily focused on electricity from renewable sources.
•  METI warned market players of a need to brace for volatile market prices and a rise in power
imbalancing rates. The ministry urged participants to understand market risks and secure power
supplies not linked to the spot market, as well as securing a demand response that could be
activated when market prices rise, conduct hedging in futures market, and subscribe to insurance

policies for renewables issued by municipalities.
•  Renewables operators and retailers will have more choices next year with a new aggregator system
due to take effect from 2022. But for the current year, they’re urged to take part in a training
session that METI will organize soon.

Milestone for older nuclear plants in Japan as Kansai Electric’s Mihama NPP Unit 3 restart
(Nikkei, June 23)
•  KEPCO restarted the Unit 3 reactor at the Mihama nuclear power station.
•  The restart was plagued by delays and comes 18 months later than scheduled.
•  The reactor, which was opened 44 years ago, was idle for 10 years.

•  After the Fukushima disaster, the govt. passed legislation requiring nuclear reactors to be
decommissioned after 40 years, though allowing service lives to be extended by up to 20 years in
exceptional cases if reactors meet safety criteria.
•  Mihama Unit 3 is the first reactor over 40 to be restarted since the “40 year rule” was introduced.
•  While Unit 3 will boost KEPCO’s revenue by ¥2.5 billion/month, maintenance costs will be high,
and the utility doesn’t yet know how the restart will impact its bottom line.
•  CONTEXT: The unit must still complete some mandatory upgrades to its anti-terrorism measures

and has until October to do so. Kansai Electric said it needs to power down the unit and wait for
the work to be completed before restart.
• TAKEAWAY: This is the 10th reactor to restart in Japan after the country mandated tougher sector regulations
post Fukushima, and the first restart in about three years. There are several more reasons why it is significant.
As well as taking the restarts into double digits and continuing the nuclear sector’s positive momentum since
the start of this year, Mihama is widely reported in all Japanese media as the first “over 40” year old unit to get

a green light. Originally, all reactors in Japan receive a 40-year operating license. Several recently won a 20-
year extension and the rest of the fleet will need to do the same if Japan is to have its existing nuclear plants in
operation by 2050. A good operating record for Mihama NPP may ease public concerns about extending
more 40-year permits.

(MBS News, June 26)

o  Kansai Electric President Morimoto said he will consider the construction of a new nuclear
power plant in preparation for the time when existing nuclear power plant reach their
maximum operations period of 60 years.
o  President Morimoto wants to replace the utility’s existing assets, all of which will reach
the age of 60 around mid-2030s. He also said he’d like to look at new reactor types.




Nuclear development remains divisive in Japan:
•  While right-leaning Yomiuri prints a story talking up nuclear development abroad to fire up
domestic competitive spirit to catch up, left-leaning Asahi sticks to its strongly anti-nuclear stance

and lambasts the life extensions of older facilities.
•  These stances are not a surprise, but it is a timely reminder of how problematic the nuclear energy
issue remains in Japan.
•  Meanwhile, local governments are stuck in the middle but are supposed to act as neutral referees,
giving the final go-ahead to nuclear reactor restarts. In some cases, local governments even have
small equity stake in the regional utilities.
•  We expect this topic to remain top energy news in Japan throughout the rest of the year.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Western nations press on with small modular reactor development
(Yomiuri Shimbun, June 21)
o  Recent improvements in the safety and economy of small modular reactor technology
being developed in the U.S. and Europe mean the technology is likely to be
commercially viable by the latter half of the decade.
o  Japanese reactor manufacturers are hoping the SMR boom will breathe much-needed life

into their industry.
o  Most SMR’s have an output in the order of tens to hundreds of megawatts. Proponents
claim they are safer than traditional designs because they envelop a light water reactor in
a pool of water.
o  By prefabricating reactor components in factories for assembly on site, it is possible to
keep construction costs down to around 10 of 20% of traditional levels.

o  In addition to a joint development project between Hitachi and General Electric,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is also researching relocatable SMR technology.

cooled binary power generation system with 2 MW of capacity.
•  Construction is scheduled to begin in August 2022, and commercial operation will begin in
November 2023.
•  CONTEXT: Traditional geothermal power plants pump high-temperature steam from deep
underground and use that to turn a turbine and generate electricity before returning hot water into
the ground through a well. Binary technology turns the hot water into steam that’s sent into
another turbine.

Stalled Solar Push Has Government Mulling More Financing
To Localities to Overcome NIMBY Protests

Almost one in 11 towns and villages in Japan restrict or altogether ban development
of utility-scale solar on their territory. Such caution is increasingly at odds with the
national strategy to put renewables at the core of Japan’s future energy mix.

As the central government adds new laws and targets that mandate local progress
towards decarbonization, regional populations are pushing back. Locals claim some
solar developments are an eyesore and a burden in times of natural disasters.

With under-staffed and under-funded local governments caught in the middle,
something will have to give – and soon – if Japan is to maintain its renewables growth
rate. The pace of growth in solar projects is already starting to lag.


The Last 10 Years in Solar: an Overview
•  Japan introduced a feed-in tariff (FIT) program for renewables in July 2012 to establish which was
then the world’s highest guaranteed payments for electricity. This led to a rapid expansion of
capacity, especially in solar.
•  FIT was introduced to promote five types of renewables – solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and
small hydropower.
•  Solar expanded the fastest because it can be set up faster than other renewable projects and no
environmental impact assessment was required by the central government until recently.
•  In 2011, solar accounted for just 0.4% of Japan’s electricity generation. In seven years, its share
increased to 6%, the largest renewable power source after hydro.


Not in my back yard (NIMBY)
Yufu City, in the southwestern prefecture of Oita, is
a popular tourist destination famous for hot springs.
The city became Japan’s first municipality to pass an
ordinance to limit development of solar power
stations in January 2014, less than 2 years after the
FIT program began.

‘’This ordinance was introduced to strike a balance
between natural beauty, the development and
preservation of scenic views and pleasant living
environment, and the rapid development of
renewable projects,’’ according to the city’s website.

The expansion of renewables projects throughout Japan has prompted more and
more local governments to follow in restricting installations of photovoltaic panels in
scenic towns and at sites of historic importance.

Nearly 150 local governments – including three whole prefectures, and 145 cities and
towns - followed Yufu City and issued ordinances to restrict solar development,

14


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

according to a report by the Research Institute for Local Government released in April.
The ordinances vary in degrees of restrictions and requirements. Some simply require
project developers to notify authorities about their plans, and most don’t charge
penalties on violations, according to the report.

Still, dealing with local red tape has been a constant headache for developers. It is
becoming even more so despite encouragements for local governments to achieve
ambitious climate change targets.

As well as dealing with complaints from locals, regional authorities are concerned
about the availability and security of local land. Incidents of destroyed solar panels
after heavy rains and other natural disasters have gained local and national media
attention.

Many prefectures are also concerned about the additional burden that solar farms
place on their personnel, who lack experience overseeing renewables projects. For
local governments, this is simply another cost.

‘’We call on the central government to provide the utmost support by presenting us
with clear criteria and guidelines, providing manpower, and covering all the cost for
local governments to set targets and promotion zones for renewable energy,’’ a group
comprising 34 prefectures said in a statement this month.


National vs Local Viewpoint
The view from Tokyo is different. Prime Minister Suga announced in October that
Japan will achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and then in April drastically raised the
country’s emissions reduction target for FY2030. The new target dictates that Japan
will cut emissions by 46% from FY2013 levels.

Since Japan relies on natural gas and coal for over 70% of its electricity, the national
emissions targets will require a drastic revamp of the electricity mix. Irrespective of
what happens to the nation’s nuclear reactors, renewables are expected to play a
growing and possibly dominant role.

How Japan will achieve such a rapid and wholesale overhaul, however, is less clear.

In the decade since the Fukushima disaster, Japan has amassed 56 GW of solar
capacity, the world’s third-largest. That could increase to 88 GW by 2030 if current
policies to support solar are maintained and the current rate of installation – 1.5GW a
year – continues, according to an estimate by METI.

A METI task force is reviewing how much more solar can be added via more
aggressive policies. In the near future, the government is expected to introduce a
standard that would mandate all public buildings to install rooftop photovoltaics.

Solar panels on public properties could add as much as 19 GW of capacity, according
to a Nikkei report, but this is far shy of what Japan would need if renewables were at
the core of its long-term net-zero policy. METI estimates that the country’s solar
capacity may need to reach 260 GW by 2050 if the share of renewables is set at 50%
to 60% in the power mix. Also, 90 GW of wind and a further 60 GW from hydro,
biomass and geothermal power would be required by 2050, according to METI.

Therefore, it’s no surprise that the central government is increasingly counting on local
officials to favor renewables. According to the roadmap for regional decarbonization,
released earlier this month, the Ministry of the Environment will pick at least 100
‘’leading decarbonization areas.’’ Governments, businesses, and financial institutions
in such designated areas will provide support to adopt more renewables and energy
saving measures in buildings and promote electrification.

The roadmap comes on top of Japan’s global warming law, passed in May. The
revised law mandates that prefectures and cities with large population set their own
renewable energy targets, and urges smaller municipalities to set similar goals.


Putting money where the mouth is
If the national government wants targets to be met, it must provide clear financial
support and human resources that lead to the creation of more clean energy
businesses led by locals, Yamashita Noriaki, a senior researcher at the Institute for
Sustainable Energy Policies, wrote in a report in December.

Yamashita also recommended setting up an organization for dispute settlement,
similar to Germany’s Kompetenzzentrum Naturschutz und Energiewende (KNE).

The message is finally starting to get through to the national government. This month,
Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro signaled for the first time that Japan is
considering a subsidy scheme for local governments that host solar and wind projects.

A similar system has operated for nuclear power plants for years. Now, renewables
need the same if they are to become a major source of Japan’s electricity, Koizumi
said.

Japan’s Offshore Wind in Pivotal Year Towards a Mass Deployment


On June 11, the METI announced the results of Japan’s first commercial-scale
offshore wind tender as the country starts to build a key pillar of its future energy
strategy almost from scratch.

This is a historical step for Japan, a relative late-comer to offshore wind despite
boasting one of the world’s longest coastlines. The government has set ambitious
targets of 10 GW in offshore wind capacity in 2030, and between 30 GW and 45 GW
in 2040. The tender result is one of the first major steps to hitting those goals.

Whether the planned scale-up takes place, however, depends on several factors. As
domestic and foreign companies pour into the new industry, the government will be
required to ensure a fair and competitive environment – including access to key
infrastructure and other support. What’s more, Japan’s ports and grid systems will
need major upgrades to facilitate offshore wind projects.
Should the market entrants from Europe and the U.S., as well as domestic players, find
early success in Japanese seas, offshore wind carries the potential to take over as one
of the biggest capacity contributors to the country’s energy mix. Outsized problems,

however, may deter future investment and impact not only wind but green hydrogen
and other wind-related energy strategies.
This year will be a pivotal one for offshore wind in Japan.

Offshore Wind Tender Result: Round 1
The first tender’s winner, for the wind promotion zone in Goto City, Nagasaki
prefecture, was a consortium led by Toda Corporation of Japan. The all-Japan group
of six, which includes big energy companies and power utilities, was the only bidder.

The apparent lack of rival interest is mainly because this is the only one of the first-
round sea areas focused on floating offshore wind technology. The winner is
guaranteed a feed-in tariff (FIT) price of ¥36/ kWh, higher than in the other three sea
zones. However, floating wind technology is less developed at this point. This makes
the eight-turbine, 16.8 MW capacity Nagasaki project more about the operator group
refining the feasibility of the technology and accumulating the skills, supply chains and
so on for larger deployments in the future.

Toda, a construction company, has a unique position in Nagasaki. It was involved in a
local pilot scheme for floating wind turbines that started in 2010. This pilot project
matured into a commercial operation and now accounts for 2 MW of Japan’s 7.4 MW
total in offshore wind capacity, METI data show. Toda’s experience and good relations
with the local community turned potential competitors into partners.

As far as the other three sea areas offered in the first round of tenders, the winners are
expected to be announced later in the year. The areas (Akita Yurihonjo North and
South, Akita Noshiro, and Chiba Choshi) are based on fixed-bottom offshore wind
turbines and have a FIT price ceiling of ¥29/ kWh.

What offshore wind needs: Power grid upgrades
On May 31, the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission
Operators (OCCTO) released an interim report for upgrades to the power grid, a so-
called “Master Plan”. The report provides a provisional cost-benefit analysis of what it
would take to upgrade the grid to support 30 GW and 45 GW of offshore wind
capacity, respectively.

OCCTO proposes the construction of a new 4 GW high-voltage direct current (HVDC)
submarine cable from Hokkaido to the Tokyo metropolitan area (approx. 900
kilometers) and a 2.8 GW link between Kyushu and Shikoku. This “Master Plan” will be
completed in FY2022 and align with the country’s Basic Energy Plan that’s currently
under discussion. The Plan, due for released this fall, will paint a picture of Japan’s
energy mix for 2030 and beyond.


What comes next?
In this “Round 1” of tenders, less than 2 GW of projects were auctioned, which means
that more than 8 GW still needs allocating. The government set its 10 GW by 2030
target in consultation with industry, and the number will not necessarily need to be all
in operation by the end of the decade. Still, even to reach the advanced planning and
construction phase for 10 GW from the current 0.01 GW, a lot of processes need to
accelerate. This includes speeding up the sea zone designations and tender winner
selection.

Transparency is also essential. Information disclosure will contribute to creating an
attractive market and a level playing field for all developers, plus increase trust in
offshore wind from all stakeholders, including local communities. In the case of the
Nagasaki project tender, the score of the winning project was made public, but the
names of the expert committee members who made the decision were not.

A further development to watch this fall will be the experimental start of a centralized
auction system. The model is well established in European offshore wind tenders, but
it is still under trial in Japan with some modifications. It will apply to three offshore
wind zones that have yet to be selected.

Experience in countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark shows that a
centralized tender system should reduce costs and time for each bidding process by
streamlining administration and avoiding the duplication of preliminary investigations
or environmental impact assessments.

Of course, there is also the possibility of new projects outside of the zones that the
government is promoting under the Renewable Energy Sea Utilization Act. A number
of companies have explored those options, but at present the FIT prices seem
unattractive.

The industry’s pioneers in Japan hope to turn around the economics of offshore wind
and unlock more of the country’s 715 GW1 potential capacity identified by the REI.
That would go a long way to helping Japan meet its target of carbon neutrality in
20502.







1 This subdivides into 242 GW in fixed bottom and 473 GW in floating capacity.
2 REI estimates that Japan would need at least 63 GW of offshore wind capacity to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050,

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Clean Energy:
1). Amazon will buy an additional 1.5 GW of electricity capacity from 14 new solar and
wind projects around the world. Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft account
for almost 30% of all clean energy capacity purchasing. Amazon’s cumulative capacity
is now 10 GW.
2). The IEA presented its analysis of clean energy investments for 2020, which totaled
280 GW, the highest YoY increase since 1999. China accounted for 40% of that. IEA
projects 270 GW of global clean energy investments for 2021, and 280 GW for 2022.

Climate Change/Weather:
1). A leaked 4,000-page draft IPCC report on climate change due to be released in
2022 indicates that the impact of climate change may be much worse than previously
anticipated, with the temperature rise now estimated at three degrees Celsius, twice
the level recommended in the Paris Agreement. This would also seem to confirm a
recent World Meteorological Organization analysis. The report warns of over two
billion people impacted by severe heat waves.
2). Record heat waves are being recorded in the Northwest of the U.S., in Seattle and
Portland, coupled with droughts that are reducing hydropower output, thus creating
significant pressure on power providers on the U.S. West Coast. Temperatures in
Portland are expected to reach 108 Fahrenheit, an all-time record high.

Tesla:
Tesla’s stock price climbed another 10% last week, or $60 billion, on stronger U.S.
market performance despite the disclosure that Panasonic sold all of its $3.7 billion
stake. Tesla has now recorded stock market gains of over 250% in the last 12 months.

Natural Gas/Oil:
1). Global natural gas prices have doubled YoY, and are hitting 13-year highs due to
hotter temperatures, lower levels of investment, and lower inventories in most
geographies. Russian natural gas exports to Europe are also down by almost 20%
YoY. JKM Asian prices are now $12 mmbtu. China is expected to overtake Japan as
the largest importer of LNG in FY2021.
2). Brent oil prices hit $76 for the first time in two years as oil demand recovers, ahead
of an OPEC meeting this week.

Solar Energy:
1). Higher steel, polysilicon, and freight costs are impacting the solar industry with
stock market prices down almost 20% YTD. Steel input prices for solar projects have
doubled from Q1 2020.
2). The U.S. has placed five Chinese solar companies that make polysilicon on its
sanctioned “entity list” due to issues around forced labor in Xinjiang.

Nuclear Power:
1). Unit 5 of the Hongyanhe nuclear power plant in China's Liaoning province was
connected to the electricity grid last week. The 1080 MW domestically-designed
20

ACPR1000 pressurized water reactor is scheduled to enter commercial operation later
in 2021.
2). In the U.S., Exelon notified PJM Interconnection of its plan to deactivate two Byron
nuclear reactors in Illinois after state lawmakers adjourned without reaching an
agreement on clean energy legislation that would have allowed the plants to continue
operating.

Shipping:
European shipping industry executives warned that EU goals to reduce CO2
emissions 55% by 2030 could end up creating more shipping capacity as ship speeds
are reduced to meet stricter emissions targets in the absence of carbon neutral fuels.
This could be counterproductive.

Aviation:
U.S. airports are set to receive $ 8 billion in Covid-19 financial assistance.

Methane Emissions:
A recent research survey in California found that waste landfills may be emitting more
methane than the fossil fuel or the agricultural sectors.

ESG:
Microsoft and Google are resisting calls for more disclosure on ESG metrics in SEC
10k filings due to legal risks. Gary Gensler met with President Biden and Treasury
Secretary Yellen last week to discuss SEC ESG disclosures.

Trees:
JP Morgan will acquire Campbell Global, a U.S. manager of timberland and forest
carbon offsets, for $5.3 billion.

China:
Next week during the CCP’s 100th celebration, China will inaugurate the Baihetan Dam
on the Jinsha River in Sichuan Province which will be the world’s largest arch dam with
16 one GW hydro turbine generators making it the second largest dam project after
China’s Three Gorges Dam which is 22.5 GW.

South Korea:
As part of its 2050 net-zero pledge, South Korea is indicating that it may decide to
halt all coal-powered generation by 2050.

Singapore:
Lim Oon Kuin, the founder of Hin Leong Trading, the bankrupt Singapore oil trading
company, is facing 105 new charges including forgery and cheating.

Australia:
The government rejected an application to build the world’s largest renewable energy
project, worth $38 billion, a hydrogen export project in Western Australia dubbed the
Asian Renewable Energy Hub.. Australia has yet to commit to a net-zero CO2
emissions timetable.

India:
Reliance Industries, the Indian oil refiner and conglomerate with a market
capitalization of $185 billion, committed to a carbon-zero goal by 2035. Reliance also

appointed Yasir-al-Rumayyan, the head of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, to
its board and is expecting a $15 billion investment from Saudi Arabia.

Pakistan:
In July, Saudi Arabia will resume $1.5 billion of oil aid to Pakistan that was suspended
due to Pakistan’s close ties with Turkey and Iran.

Russia:
Rosatom, which operates 36 nuclear reactors in 12 countries, will boost development
of and investments in small-scale reactors, floating nuclear power stations, wind
energy, energy storage and hydrogen projects. Rosatom wants to triple revenues by
2030 to $55 billion.

Belarus Sanctions:
As part of a sanctions regime effective June 25th, EU entities are not allowed to
import, purchase or transport petroleum products originated, located or exported
from Belarus, ranging from motor fuels to specialized products such as petroleum
coke, as well as LPG. Crude oil is excluded from the EU sanctions. The provision of
technical assistance, brokering services, financing or financial assistance, as well as
insurance and re-insurance for Belarusian oil products is also prohibited.

Iran:
Ebrahim Raisi, the head of Iran’s judiciary, was elected president on June 19th and will
take office in the first week of August replacing Hassan Rouhani. The JCPOA nuclear
negotiations are due to resume on Sunday. Success may free up oil exports to Japan
and other Asian countries. Sanctions have crippled the economy. Raisi was placed on
a U.S. sanctions list for human rights violations in 2019. Raisi is also refusing to include
ballistic missile development in the JCPOA negotiations. Iranian authorities claimed to
have foiled at attack on an atomic energy agency building on Wednesday.

Lebanon:
Lebanon is running out of foreign currency to pay for gasoline imports.

Egypt:
The Suez Canal Authority has reportedly agreed to compensation of $200 million with
the Japanese owners of the Ever Given that blocked the canal last March.

Sweden:
Ikea and the Rockefeller Foundation will start a $10 billion energy poverty fund to
