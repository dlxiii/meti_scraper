METI policy panel to draft new plan in power auction system to finance NPPs
(Government statement, July 26)
•  A METI sub-panel on basic power and gas policies will draft a new plan to finance nuclear power
plants by using a long-term decarbonization power auction system.
•  NPPs need investment to improve safety; the power auction system can help them to boost profits
on their investment into nuclear safety units, as stated in the Decarbonization Power Supply Act.
•  The panel also identified facility upgrades for hydrogen/ammonia/ biomass co-firing at thermal

plants as projects that would be financed under the power auction system.
•  The first long-term decarbonization power auction will be held in Jan 2024.
• TAKEAWAY: See the analysis: Overview of the Long-Term Decarbonized Capacity Auction in the Jan 23, 2023
issue of Japan NRG.



METI, JFTC in talks to ease antitrust rules on green business projects
(Japan NRG, July 27)
•  METI and the Japan Fair Trade Commission began discussions to ease antitrust regulations on
collaborations for net zero initiatives, said Yoshimura Katsumoto, METI director of Material

Industries Division. He spoke at Techno Frontier in Tokyo.
•  In March, the JFTC published Green Competition Guidelines to clarify net zero collaborations that
would be non-compliant with the Anti-Monopoly Act.
•  “Companies, when on their own, are able to speed up research, but when they collaborate the
projects stop because they can’t share information,” Yoshimura said. METI proposes to ease rules
on information sharing to spur initiatives to speed up decarbonization.




JERA launches $300 mln VC fund for energy and tech startups
(Company statement, July 24)

MHI to lead high-temp gas reactor demo, expand hydrogen power supply
(Company statement, July 25)
•  METI’s energy agency, ANRE, selected MHI to lead the next-gen nuclear project based around
high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGR).

•  MHI will be in charge of coordinating the R&D, design, and construction of a HTGR demonstration
reactor that the govt wants to be in operation during the 2030s.
•  CONTEXT: HTGRs are capable of supplying carbon free heat at extremely high temperatures
exceeding 900°C, which makes them suitable as a power source for electrolysis for creating
hydrogen. MHI has been involved in HTGR tech since the 1970s.
•  MHI wants the reactor development to include a facility to produce hydrogen. It targets 900°C with

a thermal output of 600 MW for the nuclear reactor.
• TAKEAWAY: This is a project that is more about hydrogen than nuclear. Since the hydrogen manufacturing
process would not create emissions, and could be done on a mass scale, Mitsubishi has designs on offering it
to a number of industrial sectors such as steelmaking to help them move to cleaner processes. It may also be
marketed as fuel for hydrogen power generation, feedstock for chemical products and fuel cell trucks.

million tons/ year of hydrogen by 2040. ENEOS also plans to produce SAF and explore carbon
capture and storage solutions.
•  The goal is for carbon neutrality in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2040. To offset remaining
emissions, they’ll use CCS and carbon credits from forestry projects.




Australian ammonia imports log their most competitive ever in H1 2023
(Japan NRG, July 28)
•  Ammonia imports from Australia, averaging at ¥62,215/ ton, were the most competitive in the
January to June period, according to customs data. The figures are for ammonia for fuel

specifications.
•  Imports from Indonesia averaged at ¥89,186/ ton, Saudi Arabia ¥266,769/ ton, and Taiwan
¥644,719/ ton.
•  Japan imported 105,015 tons of ammonia for a total value of ¥8.8 million in the first half of the
year.
•  During the period, Japan exported 50 tons to China, Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S. for ¥58
million, or ¥1.2 million/ ton.



Sekisui proposes World Expo 2025 exhibitors to test PSC cells
(Japan NRG, July 25)
•  Sekisui Chemicals will install prototypes of perovskite solar cell (PSC) at the World Expo 2025 site
in Osaka, and will provide the modules to the other Expo participants interested in testing the new
tech.
•  It is likely to offer the same prototype it has provided, or plans to provide, to JERA, the Tokyo

Metropolitan govt, NTT Data and JR East. The company plans to commercialize the product in
2025.
•  CONTEXT: PSC is a next-gen solar cell tech made with thin perovskite-structured layers, instead of
silicon to generate power. The World Expo will be the first exposure of the Japanese PSC tech to
the international audience.
• TAKEAWAY: The govt restricts Japanese PSC players to engage with foreign counterparts, and will possibly

prohibit production of PSC systems overseas as well, in a bid to protect the tech, according to a METI official.
However, installing PSC systems on exhibition booths will not result in technology breaches.



Itochu and Emirates Global Aluminium to work on a sustainable aluminum supply
(Company statement, July 21)
•  Itochu and Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA) signed an MoU at the UAE-Japan Business Forum.
•  The MoU focuses on aluminum production growth and ensuring a sustainable aluminum supply to
the global market, as well as decarbonization efforts.
•  Itochu has a long history of selling high-value-added aluminum products made by EGA to

customers in Japan, Asia, North America, and Europe.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: EGA uses LNG to generate electricity required for aluminum production, but plans to
shift to nuclear, solar and hydrogen-derived power. It also produces its own alumina feedstock,
made from caustic soda, likely produced at fossil-fuel powered plants, and bauxite ore.
• TAKEAWAY: The extent is unclear of the aluminum supply chain that the companies plan to decarbonize --
from bauxite mining to aluminum billets, foundry alloys and slabs – or further downstream. Many Japanese

business leaders flew with PM Kishida and participated in the UAE-Japan Business Forum to understand the
UAE’s potential to deliver cheap green hydrogen. If the UAE produces the world's cheapest hydrogen, many
Japanese companies would happily move their downstream manufacturing operations there.




JPX to restart carbon credit trading in October
(Company statement, July 26)
•  JPX officially announced the opening of a carbon credit market in October, which would restart the
trading that was trialed in a limited mode last year.
•  This will further contribute to developing a carbon pricing system in Japan.

transportation means that use light diesel oil. The initiative was selected in April for the Okinawa
Clean Energy Introduction Promotion Research Program.
•  CONTEXT: The ATJ technology utilizes a catalytic reaction to produce SAF and RD from alcohol
(ethanol) and has obtained certification for aircraft use according to the necessary ASTM (American
Society for Testing and Materials) standards.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

KCPC launches new distillation unit to help produce zero-carbon SAF
(Company statement, July 12)
o  Bioethanol is a raw material to produce sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Kimura Chemical
Plants (KCPC) launched a new energy-saving, heat-pump type bioethanol distillation unit
that enables zero CO2 emission in the production of SAF.
o  When producing SAF by the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process, bioethanol (the raw material)

needs to be distilled or concentrated to increase its energy density. Traditionally, this
required boiler steam that emits a lot of CO2.
o  With this new equipment, bioethanol is distilled by renewable power, without using
boiler steam. Then the heat pump recovers low-temperature heat, reusing it as energy.

EVs become heavier as more steel parts are used

(Japan NRG, July 26)
•  EV models released in the last two years have become heavier since their structural components
and body parts are now made of steel, instead of aluminum and resin, according to Nikkei BP
Consulting analyst Kariatuma Koji. Aluminum was used extensively in previous models to reduce
car weight; but the metal was used only for chassis in the most recent models from Tesla, BYD,
Volkswagen and Nissan.
•  Kariatsuma noted that automakers are integrating onboard chargers and electronic control units

with other components and trying new approaches to cool batteries. He spoke at the Techno-
Frontier 2023 event in Tokyo.
• TAKEAWAY: EVs have been going through a cycle: battery raw material prices rise, less-expensive steel parts
are used, cars become heavy and battery performances decline, and then cars become lighter by replacing
heavy parts with parts made with lighter materials such as aluminum, resin and plastics. The need to be
lightweight will likely be highlighted again despite new features to improve battery performances, as recent

models are mounted with cameras and entertainment systems. Meanwhile, the trend to integrate different
component units may create new challenges for recycling car parts.

(Nikkei, July 28)
•  Kansai Electric restarted Unit 1 at Takahama NPP after a 12-year shutdown. This is the beginning of

long-term operation for Japan's oldest NPP, in service for 48 years.
•  A new law allows nuclear reactors to operate beyond 60 years; if Unit 1 operates beyond 60 years,
it will be Japan’s first to do so.
•  Kansai Electric's financial performance has improved, reporting a record profit due to the decrease
in fuel prices and improved operating rates of NPPs. This could lead to price cuts for customers,
increasing Kansai Electric's popularity with the public after recent scandals such as the
unauthorized view of consumers' data.
•  However, challenges remain, such as managing spent fuel storage capacity. Kansai Electric needs

to finalize the location for interim storage of spent fuel by the end of 2023, or its older reactors will
need to shut down.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Municipalities seek more control over renewable energy projects
Last year, a small town in western Japan shocked the renewables industry when it
called for a new tax on solar projects calculated on the area that panels occupy. The
idea was eventually quashed by the central government. But this year, a new and
much larger regional actor has announced similar plans.

Miyagi Prefecture in northeast Japan has an area of 7,300 square kilometers, close to
the size of Cyprus. It was an early mover in the renewables space, attracting the fourth
largest Feed-in-Tariff capacities in 2014. Yet, a decade later, it has unveiled plans to
install a new levy that would effectively tax every one in five yen earned by some solar
and wind operators.

The stance by local governments seems at odds with the national goals to double
Japan’s renewables capacity this decade to meet CO2 reduction targets. However,
the tax plans by the regions reflect their growing concern that a general rush to add
more renewables has ignored certain negative impacts on the local environment and
society. The most acute today is concern that the clearing of trees for some
renewables projects will expose the affected areas to risks of landslides and water
shortages.

Miyagi’s tax has yet to receive approval at the national level. But its passage could
alter the economics of future projects and entice other regions to add levies on a
renewables sector that is already contending with rising costs and lower tariffs. When
Japan NRG spoke with local officials, they explained that their motivations are
misunderstood.


What happened last summer
Last year, Mimasaka City’s solar tax was a hot topic in energy circles. The city of about
26,000 people proposed a levy based on the area of solar panels. The proposal drew
gasps in the renewables community and followed a trend of more and more local
authorities passing ordinances to limit construction of new green energy projects.

Mimasaka’s idea, however, did not spread. None of the nearby municipalities joined.
In fact, Sayo Township, Mimasaka’s neighbor, told Japan NRG that for decades the
town had run a solar power station as an emergency backup resource and they
believed that renewables are important. The national government gently deflected
Mimasaka’s calls to review its tax idea, urging the city to hold more dialog with
renewables operators.

Miyagi’s renewable tax plan is a different story. The proposal is to put a 20% tax on
the operating profit of solar, wind and biomass operators that cut down over 0.5
hectares of forest to install the project. The local assembly passed the bill earlier this
month. And Miyagi’s neighbors have been supportive of the cause to conserve forest
resources from developments.

Miyagi has also walked back some of its initial fire, suggesting that the tax could be
lifted for operators that create projects within specified Renewables Promotion Zones

or those recognized by local stakeholders as “collaborative” developers. The
prefecture is now taking feedback on its proposals.

The Japan Wind Power Association slammed the tax for potentially deterring wind
development and hindering national climate targets. However, municipality taxes
require approval from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, which
could foil Miyagi’s plans as it did with Mimasaka City; though the prefecture is a
bigger player. In showing flexibility of application, Miyagi may also convince the
ministry that it will achieve “collaborative engagement” with developers.


Roots of the anti-wind movement
The huge irony is that local resistance to energy projects was something once solely
reserved for nuclear power plants. But since last year’s energy crisis, the public
acceptance of nuclear power has been rising fast. So where did this newfound
resistance to renewable energy come from?

Visiting Kawasaki Township in Miyagi Prefecture feels like going back 50 years in time
– there’s no rooftop solar panels on houses nor office flats. The only PV is outside the
town office, powering a display with information on radioactivity levels.

Kawasaki lies around 100 kilometers northwest of the Fukushima nuclear power plant.
It’s in the heart of the Zao mountain range and daylight hours are short. The town is
not ideal for solar power but many developers saw a high potential in wind power.
Kansai Electric (KEPCO) was one of them.

Contrary to media reports about KEPCO’s “arrogant push” to install 23 wind stations
totaling 96 MW, Kawasaki township officials said the company had been in
close communication with locals. “Town meetings were held, although they were
under no legal obligation to do so for a plant of their size,” said one official,
specifying that while KEPCO followed the right procedures, the plan itself was
“wrong”.

In July 2022, the power utility scrapped the wind project plan after environmental
impact assessments that followed on the back of a strong opposition from Kawasaki
residents, the town authority, the Miyagi governor and the Yamagata governor. The
move spread like wildfire, impacting the mood around large solar installations in the
Zao area, and wind installations in Kami, Naruko, and other townships in Miyagi.

A Kawasaki official who had served as a direct interface with KEPCO said the leading
concern was tearing down the mountain façade, which could cause landslides.

This fear was not unfounded. From April to 2021-February 2022, there were 33 solar
power plants that reported landslide-triggered incidents to METI. Later, the ministry
conducted on-site inspections of 280 solar power stations suspected of exposure to
landslide risk, and it plans to make inspections annually. The high risk areas were
concentrated in Hiroshima, Yamaguchi and Shimane Pref in west Japan.

In many cases, the risk arose because developers were only able to secure land with
forest cover and needed to clear it to site the equipment. Or, it was the cheaper
option.

Regulation through tax
In the case of Kawasaki Township, officials decided that a new tax would be effective
in deterring further deforestation. On July 4, the local assembly passed the tax bill,
saying a 20% rate would reflect the disciplinary purpose of the measure.

The levy is officially called a Tax to Promote Co-Habitation of Renewables and
Communities. If the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications gives approval
then it will take effect in April 2024. However, contrary to its name, the tax is powerful
enough to kill projects. A 1 MW solar station typically requires over 0.5 hectares.

The Miyagi official estimates that 40-100 projects under construction will be subject to
the new tax. Smaller solar projects comprise the majority of those numbers, but in
terms of capacity onshore wind will face the bigger impact.

Project owners include local farmers converting idle property to solar power stations.
Many lack manpower to look after their land and keep away herds of wild monkeys
and boars that damage crops. To accommodate such cases, Miyagi Prefecture plans a
new category of “project operators that have won community consensus”. These will
be exempt from the tax.

The Miyagi official said despite broad media coverage, many operators found out
about the tax for the first time only recently. But he stressed: “We want to block
deforestation, not renewable development.”


Ripple effects
Despite the good intentions, Miyagi’s example could spur more local tax proposals
elsewhere. Policies in the name of forest protection have done well over the years. In
2002, Kochi Prefecture started the country’s first forest tax levied on residents. The
system spread to over 30 prefectures, and was recently embraced by the national
government. From April 2024, Japan will levy forest taxes on all individual taxpayers.

From March this year, Kawasaki Township also requires operators with over 1 MW of
generation capacity to take out three types of damage insurance to ensure victims of
landslide incidents can be fully compensated.

For now, this has played out as a regional drama, albeit with national consequences.
But it may yet come knocking on the doorsteps in Tokyo.

Many of the bigger renewables projects in the regions, including offshore wind farms,
are built with the goal of sending their electricity to the big cities, including the Tokyo
Metropolitan area. The distributed power system will require many new power lines
and other grid facilities to run through natural terrain. A quarter of Miyagi Prefecture,
for example, is designated as national park land.

Building new power transmission networks will mean cutting down lots of trees, says
one contractor that works on renewables projects in the regions. Once this element is
factored in, power users in cities might be asked to make their own contribution to
forestry and water conservation.

Fair or not, regulatory and tax pressure on renewables seem to be a trend that’s here
to stay.

As Agrisolar Draws Interest,
Inactive Solar Tariff Permit Holders Get Weeded Out

As Japan continues to make strides in its transition to renewable energy, solar power
stands out as a significant contributor to the country’s green energy supply, outpacing
all other renewable sources. However, as the country aims to achieve its ambitious
target of raising the renewables share in its power mix to 36-38% by 2030, peculiar
challenges in the solar sector have emerged.

The slow progress in bringing all renewables capacity with tariff licenses into
operation has prompted the government to take action. With over 8.9 GW of certified
capacity still unused, METI is starting to revoke licenses for projects that have not
made progress or met promised deadlines; the goal is to ensure that the solar sector
operates more efficiently and transparently.

One notable area that has faced challenges is agrisolar, which is the combination of
solar energy and agriculture. While this innovative concept has the potential to make
use of abandoned farmland and promote sustainable agricultural practices, there have
been instances of non-compliance with regulations, leading to license revocations.

To address this issue and promote the right approach, several large Japanese
companies have joined the agrisolar sector, developing and testing new technologies
that prioritize crop growth while generating solar power.


The culling begins
As of FY2021, the ratio of renewables in Japan hit 20.3% of the total power mix. Solar
accounts for the biggest contribution, finally surpassing hydropower with 8.3% of the
power mix compared with the latter’s 7.5%.

The amount of installed solar capacity in Japan hit 70.7 GW at the end March 2023. In
just the last three years, 14.9 GW of solar generation went into operation, METI data
show. Most is driven by the state Feed-In Tariff (FIT) and Feed-In Premium plans.

However, about 8.9 GW of capacity certified under FIT or FIP hasn’t been put into
operation. Concerned that some license owners are motivated more by speculative
reasons or lack the ability to complete proposed projects, METI is canceling licenses
when construction has not gone ahead or met other criteria.

The end of March saw the first deadline for proving to the government that a project
is genuine; the result has been the culling of more than 53,000 installations with
“unutilized” tariff licenses. That affected about 4.26 GW of projected capacity.

This weeding out of inactive license holders will continue. In FY2023, which ends on
March 31, 2024, about 12,000 installations for 800 MW of capacity face expiry unless
progress is made. In FY2024, about 21,000 facilities with a capacity of 3.2 GW will be
in the same situation.

So far, non-tariff capacity additions are small. In FY2022, only about 0.5 GW of solar
generation was brought online without utilizing the FIT or FIP system.















Wrong and right agriculture
There are a number of reasons why some developers have not moved forward with
construction or met the deadlines set in its application for the FIT or FIP license. As
METI’s own expert panels concluded, issues include the ability to secure appropriate
land and finding a way to coexist with local communities, as well as an ability to keep
costs in check.

One area that seems to have led to several license revocations are projects that
combine solar with agriculture (called agrisolar or agrivoltaics). At the end of each
quarter, the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) began announcing the
revocation of FIT-approved business licenses. In January, one project was revoked for
installing facilities without obtaining permission under the Agricultural Land Act. In
April, five cases were revoked.

To make sure agrisolar is done the right way, some large domestic companies are
joining the sector to develop and test new technologies. With new land for solar at a
premium, and plenty of abandoned farmland nationwide, this is seen as a profitable
direction both by agricultural equipment makers like Kubota and large energy firms
such as oil refiner Idemitsu Kosan, which has a demonstration project for new agrisolar
in paddy fields in Kisarazu City, Chiba Prefecture.

Idemitsu is testing a system that uses a tracking frame which automatically adjusts the
direction of panels to follow the movement of the sun; the panels receive light on
both sides. The most distinctive feature is that during the rice farming season (April to
August), priority is given to irradiating crops grown under the panels in order to
maintain and improve yield and quality. Outside of the growing season, the system
gives priority to irradiating the solar panels.

Making these adjustments, the company seeks to show that "farming" and "power
generation" are compatible and more profitable than their separate iterations. The
tracking solar rack is manufactured by Yokohama-based Clean Energy Japan, which is
applying for a patent that would cover the tech’s use to illuminate crops during the
rice farming season.

The 45-kW test facility will also examine the cost and efficiency of operations before
Idemitsu moves forward to commercial-scale, farm-based solar power generation. The
demonstration period will last until September 2025.

Rice accounts for more than half of Japan’s total farmland area.

Advantages of farmer-operated solar power generation
Since the modules are double-sided, the generation volumes lost to irradiating crops
can be compensated for throughout the year. The project’s electricity will be sold to
the public through Idemitsu Green Power, a wholly owned retail electricity provider.

An automated agrivoltaic system could bring a number of advantages to farmers. It
would open up the potential for farmers to earn income from renting out their land,
from electricity sales, all while continuing to operate their existing farms.

Electronic materials maker Nitto Kogyo is taking the green concept further and testing
solar sharing using reused panels. It has set up a demonstration facility in Kakegawa
City, Shizuoka Prefecture that has a capacity of 49.5 kW, expecting to generate 98
MWh of electricity annually. The power will be sold to an electricity trading platform
run by Digital Grid.

A Nitto Kogyo subsidiary is supplying the reused panels, under which the
manufacturer’s staff will cultivate olives. The site’s shading rate is about 32%. A Chiba
university affiliated venture is helping the company with the cultivation plan, as well as
with the required permits, etc.

The solar sector in Japan holds great promise, but addressing the slowing progress of
recent solar rollouts and ensuring compliance with local and national regulations are
crucial to getting the industry back on track. It will certainly benefit from market entry
of new kinds of companies and from showcasing collaborations between energy
developers and manufacturers.

In the coming years, the weeding out of tariff holders who fail to progress with their
solar projects will continue, enabling the Japanese solar sector to operate more
efficiently. By overcoming the challenges and embracing innovative approaches like
agrisolar, Japan can enhance its renewable energy portfolio, drive sustainable
agricultural practices, and move closer to achieving clean energy goals.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ National grid
China is introducing more flexible power transmission arrangements into its national
grid system in order to avoid a repeat of last year’s outages. In response to decreased
output from hydropower plants, authorities have "rationally optimized" power
transmission between provinces to send more power to the drought-stricken
southwest.

Critical raw materials (CRMs)
A report by the Energy Transitions Commission says the global supply-demand gap
for metals could be reduced by recycling and using less material. Take lithium: by
2030 global demand is expected to soar 600%, and will be 30% higher than projected
supply. With extensive recycling and using less lithium, that gap could narrow to just
10%.

Europe/ Oil refining
After Nigeria removed fuel subsidies, which dramatically lowered the country's
domestic demand, one of Europe's main markets for gasoline has shrunk, threatening
to squeeze EU refiners. North America and West Africa, led by Nigeria, are the top
destinations for EU petrol exports; the EU produces more gasoline than it uses.

Indonesia/ Oil and gas
Shell and Chevron's sale of stakes in major projects to Pertamina, Petronas and Eni
will stimulate development, enabling the country to boost flagging output, those
companies said. In recent years, oil and gas production in Indonesia has been
declining due to depleting reserves. "Our participation underscores the commitment
to support Indonesia's production target of 1mbpd and 12 billion cfpd of gas by
2030," said the CEO of Petronas.

Pakistan/ LNG
Pakistan LNG Ltd and the Azeri firm, SOCAR, agreed that Azerbaijan will offer 12 low-
cost LNG cargoes to Pakistan each year. However, Pakistan won’t be bound to buy
the gas. Pakistan has struggled to get new long-term LNG deals since 2022 when
faced with a domestic financial crunch and European demand that priced the country
out of the market.

Saudi Arabia/ CRMs
Saudi Arabia launched its first foray into the global mining industry, taking a minority
stake in Vale’s copper and nickel unit. A JV between Saudi Arabian Mining Co and the
country’s Public Investment Fund will own 10%. Over the next decade, Vale will
deploy up to $30 billion on new projects across Brazil, Canada and Indonesia to
expand production of copper and nickel which are needed in EVs.

Uganda/ Oil
Despite opposition from environmentalists, France's TotalEnergies began commercial
drilling at its Tilenga petroleum project in Uganda's west ahead of an expected start
of oil production in the African country in 2025.

UK/ Battery storage
Energy infrastructure development company Carlton Power plans to build the world’s
largest battery energy storage (1 GW). Construction of the £750 million battery
storage begins in Q1 of 2024 and commercial operation in Q4 of 2025.

UK/ Clean energy
Octopus Energy will invest £15 billion into offshore wind by 2030. The company has
$7.7 billion worth of clean energy projects globally. The new investment will generate
12 GW of renewable electricity per year. The company is looking at renewables
projects globally but maintains a focus on Europe.

Wind power
The Global Wind Energy Council said a record 680 GW of wind energy capacity will
be installed by 2027. Financing has been a challenge; higher energy prices have
fuelled inflation and interest rates. But the expected revenues of those who plan to
build wind turbines have not risen.
