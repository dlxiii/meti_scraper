NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


METI announces Cabinet approval of 7th Basic Energy Plan

(Government statement, Feb 18)
•  On Feb 18, METI announced the Cabinet approval of the 7th Basic Energy Plan. There were no
major changes, but some wording of the original draft was changed.
•  With regard to nuclear power, which garnered the most attention, the following two points were
added:
o  Sincerely consider concerns about nuclear safety;
o  Take responsibility for dealing with any accidents that may occur;
•  Regarding renewable energy, several terms were added, and the promotion of renewable energy
projects other than FIT/FIP systems was added.

o  METI announced Cabinet approval of the GX2040 Vision. The original draft received 516
comments as feedback, but only a few clarifications were added; the final draft remained
as initially proposed.
o  In the section on Creating a Market that Leads to a GX Industry, some additions and
revisions were made to the "Basic Approach" and "Active Procurement of GX Products and
Services" sections.
o  In the section on Carbon Pricing, an explanation of the fossil fuel levy was added, stating
that "the cost of using fossil fuels is largely borne by society as a whole”.
o  The govt will work to realize the Vision by integrating energy policy with industrial
structure and growth.
o  CONTEXT: In 2023, the GX Promotion Act and the GX Decarbonization Power Supply Act

were passed, and the GX Promotion Strategy was decided by the Cabinet. To share the goals of
GX initiatives among the public and private sectors, the GX Promotion Strategy was revised
and the GX 2040 Vision was created. The draft was presented on Dec 26, 2024, and public
comments accepted until Jan 26.

were all approved by the Cabinet at the same time and are seen as equal parts of the national energy strategy.
They aim to simultaneously achieve stable energy supply, economic growth, and decarbonization. The
numerical targets are strict, but serve as guidelines for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. As the documents
suggest, considerable further technology breakthroughs will be needed to achieve decarbonization.



PM to launch public-private council to develop data centers and power plants

(Government statement, Feb 20)
•  PM Ishiba ordered Minister Murakami (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) and
Minister Muto (METI) to launch a public-private council for the integrated development of data
centers and power plants.
•  To realize “Regional Development 2.0,” the govt will develop information and communication
networks connecting AI, data centers, etc. as “infrastructure for a new era” to support GX and DX.
•  In the GX2040 Vision approved by the Cabinet on Feb 18, the effective coordination of electricity
and telecommunications (Watt-Bit Coordination) is also mentioned as a key point for GX industrial
sites. Actual development will now be discussed.
•  CONTEXT: Both ministries have been discussing the relationship between electric power and telecom
infrastructure in the "Expert Group on Digital Infrastructure Development", and released a summary
document in October 2024. It seeks to guide the siting of data centers to locations where existing power
infrastructure can be used, or near locations where power infrastructure is expected to be located in the
future.

OCCTO  taps Japanese group to build country’s longest undersea cable

(Japan NRG, Government statement, Feb 26)
•  OCCTO announced the winners to build the ¥1.5-¥1.8 trillion Hokkaido-Honshu Interconnection
(Japan Sea Route), which will link Hokkaido and Honshu via an undersea transmission line along
the Sea of Japan.
•  The winning consortium consists of the transmission units of Hokkaido Electric, Tohoku Electric,
TEPCO, and J-Power. They beat a group that media reports said included Frontier Power Ltd, a UK
company, as well as GE Vernova and Stonepeak.
•  CONTEXT: The connection is vital to boosting renewable energy capacity nationwide as it will help
deliver power from future wind farms off the coast of Hokkaido to main demand areas in central Japan.
It will offer 2 GW of capacity and involve 800 km of subsea cables – Japan’s longest undersea
transmission link.
•  The winning consortium will conduct feasibility studies, and address technical and business
challenges, before finalizing an implementation plan.
•  This was the first time a foreign company had expressed interest in Japan’s power grid expansion
projects since OCCTO was established in 2015. However, announcing the winning bid, OCCTO said
that only one bid was “qualified”.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan requires a major upgrade of its transmission network in order to fully develop renewable
energy systems. The subsea routes, such as the one between Japan’s north and central regions, face high costs
and technical challenges. The govt will have to provide financial support. The appearance of an international
bidder had sparked the possibility that the grid may be open to bidders outside of Japan’s major utilities. But by
saying that only one bidder was deemed qualified, OCCTO seemed to suggest that subsea cables will remain a
strategic infrastructure where the govt prefers to deal with domestic companies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan to back undersea cable investments for national security
(Nikkei, Feb 26)
o  Japan is set to expand the production and installation of undersea communications cables,
recognizing their critical role in national security.
o  The move is also part of an international trend to improve security measures amid ongoing
geopolitical tensions.
o  CONTEXT: Undersea cables handle 99% of Japan’s international communications, yet their

production has largely been driven by private firms. To strengthen the industry, METI plans to
support capital investment and subsidize the construction of cable-laying ships, addressing a
global shortage that has hindered large-scale projects.
• TAKEAWAY: The global undersea cable market is projected to grow from $2.7 billion in 2022 to $3.2 billion in
2028, fueled by the rise of AI-driven telecommunications.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toyo to collaborate with Kiso-Jiban on submarine cable engineering
(Company statement, Feb 19)
o  Toyo Construction inked an MoU with Kiso-Jiban Consultants to collaborate on submarine
cable engineering services.
o  The goal is to establish a risk assessment methodology for submarine cable installation in
Japan.
o  CONTEXT: Complex submarine topography, geological features such as seabed fault activity,
and submarine landslides along Japan’s coastal areas pose significant risks to the installation
and operation of submarine cables. Toyo Construction will offer a variety of services related to

submarine cable installation, aiming to secure a large market share in the offshore
construction sector.



ANRE eases requirements for reserve power supply
(Government statement, Feb 26)
•  ANRE will relax some requirements for participating in the reserve power supply system. The next
auction will include power sources that had to be replaced by other facilities to fulfil bid
requirements in the capacity market. Current bids are limited to power sources that were
unsuccessful or didn’t bid for two consecutive years in the main auction round.
•  CONTEXT: In the capacity market, if the winning bidder's power source becomes unavailable due to
generator failure, it can be replaced by another power source.
•  It is expected that bids in the reserve power supply system will be relatively high to cover the
elevated unit operating costs. However, ANRE wants to play a near-supply capacity role by
providing funds to cover costs (such as repairs) and prevent closures.
•  As for the applicable period, initially bidders will be allowed to set the start and end period in terms
of months, within a range of 12 to 36 months.
•  A second call will be made during FY2025 for reserve power sources that originally set FY2026 and
FY2027 as the first year for their application.
•  CONTEXT: In a questionnaire to power producers, some commented that “power supplies that have
exited the capacity market by paying an economic penalty, power supplies that have been replaced due
to generator failure, and power supplies that have won release auctions should also be allowed to bid in
the reserve power supply system.” ANRE took those considerations on board.

• TAKEAWAY: Until the latest round of public-private discussions, there was a reluctance on the side of the
bureaucrats to change participation requirements for this system. Officials have partially agreed to accept utility
demands but with conditions. Whether that is enough to draw bids for the next auction for backup power
sources is unclear, but it seems unlikely.



ANRE expands scope of eligible power sources for next LTDA
(Government statement, Feb 26)
•  ANRE will expand the scope of eligible power sources for the next long-term decarbonization power
auction (LTDA).
•  As some operators began to consider installing CCS at existing thermal power plants, ANRE wants
to support such investment. LTDA, the J-Credits carbon credits system, and GX based emissions
trading system will all be instruments that the energy agency wants to use to encourage CCS
investment.
•  CCS-related projects will need to state minimum CO2 capture rates and annual CO2 storage rates,
as well as offer details on when the technology would begin operating and how much kW of
capacity it would cover. How the CCS tech would connect and work with other support systems will
also be taken into consideration.
•  Also added to the next round of bids will be long duration energy storage systems (LDES), such as
liquid air energy storage and rock thermal storage. They will be subject to the same competitive
conditions as pumped hydro.
•  CONTEXT: The second round of LTDA was held from Jan 20 to 27.
• TAKEAWAY: Current LTDA auction bidders are undergoing government surveys to clarify their applications,
with winners likely to be announced in mid April. LTDA has attracted interest from a broad range of energy
sectors and stakeholders and is proving to be a catalyst for BESS, pumped hydro, nuclear and now possibly CCS

while peak prices fell by ¥0.33 to ¥9.77 /kWh. The highest spot price was ¥28/ kWh on Jan 9.
•  Market segmentation continued, with Hokkaido having the highest regional price at ¥14.27 /kWh.
The most constrained transmission was between Chubu and Kansai.



Hokuriku Electric might expand LNG use at Toyama Shinko power plant

(Denki Shimbun, Feb 28)
•  Hokuriku Electric began reviewing plans to build a second LNG unit at the Toyama Shinko Thermal
Power Plant in Imizu City, Toyama Pref.
•  The company plans to introduce a 600 MW high-efficiency gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC)
system, with operations to start in FY2033.
•  CONTEXT: Hokuriku Electric will decommission Unit 2 (coal-fired, 250 MW), as well as the currently
suspended Unit 1 (heavy oil/crude oil-fired, 240 MW) at the Toyama Shinko site. Also, the utility will
delay the planned decommissioning of Toyama Shinko’s Unit 1 (coal, 250 MW), originally set for
FY2024, until FY2028 in order to ensure short-term power supply stability.



JERA fails to submit bids in wholesale power market due to system error
(Company statement, Feb 22)
•  JERA failed to submit surplus power to the wholesale electricity market due to a system error,
delaying the pricing process. The issue has now been resolved.
•  CONTEXT: Under government regulations, major utilities, including JERA, are required to offer surplus
power in the market. The company was previously found to have manipulated prices in 2024,
repeatedly failing to bid during periods of reduced power output. METI issued a business improvement
recommendation to JERA in 2024 for market manipulation.



Chubu Electric begins test of regional microgrid in Iida

(Company statement, Feb 25)
•  Chubu Electric began test operation of a microgrid in Kawaji district, Iida City. It was built using the
existing power distribution system, with new battery storage and an energy management system
installed at the mega-solar power plant.
•  In the event of a prolonged power outage due to a disaster, a small power grid uses local
distribution lines between power plants. After field testing, the system is expected to be operational
by 2030.

TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP faces further delays
(Company statement, Feb 27)
•  TEPCO said that anti-terrorism construction work at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP Units 6 and 7 will
face a delay. Completion of the special safety facility for Unit 7 is now slated for Aug 2029. Unit 6’s
completion is now planned for Sept 2031.
•  TEPCO had planned to complete the new facility for Unit 7 by March 2025, and for Unit 6 by Sept
2026.
•  CONTEXT: The reasons behind the delays in completion are reported to be linked to difficulties in
securing workers, materials, and the designs. Meanwhile, in March, the Niigata Pref Assembly will
invite officials from ANRE and other agencies to explain nuclear policies. They’ll focus on Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa. This will be the first time national representatives address the assembly on the issue.
•  CONTEXT: According to the NRA, a counterterrorism facility is designed to prevent, detect, and respond
to threats. It utilizes physical barriers, surveillance systems, cybersecurity measures, and armed security
personnel. These facilities often coordinate with law enforcement and intel agencies.
• TAKEAWAY: These delays further complicate the situation at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa and, as a consequence,
TEPCO’s financials. In theory, Unit 7’s restart is still possible this summer, but the reactor must stop when the
regulatory deadline (Oct 13) for the facility's completion passes. The utility (and the govt) will hope that they
can push through a restart for Unit 7 before that Oct deadline to cover the peak power demand period during
the summer months. But for that, they still need Niigata governor’s public sign up. Meanwhile, TEPCO will
likely put more effort into restarting Unit 6, which should load nuclear fuel in June. As Unit 6 has more flexible
regulatory deadlines, TEPCO would like to have it operating starting October 2025 when Unit 7 must shut

down. As the next step, TEPCO hopes that Unit 7 will be back online in 2029 and substitute Unit 6 as the latter
comes up against its own regulatory deadline. Both of the units would not be online simultaneously until Sept
2031 in a best-case scenario.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO gets approval for changes to safety regulations at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
(Company statement, Feb 28)
o  TEPCO obtained approval for its application for changes to the safety regulations of
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP.
o  On Aug 29 2024, TEPCO submitted the application to the NRA. It submitted a
supplementary document to the NRA on Jan 30.
• TAKEAWAY: Approval helps TEPCO in loading fuel and then restarting Unit 6, something the company sees as
crucial due to the mandatory shut-down of Unit 7 in October.



Chugoku Electric restores monitoring equipment at Shimane NPP

Govt to expand ‘blue carbon’ CO2 absorption by 2040
(Denki Shimbun, Feb 28)
•  The govt set a target to expand CO2 absorption via "blue carbon" – the process by which seagrasses
and seaweeds absorb and store CO2 – to 1 Mt by FY2035, and 2 Mt by FY2040.
•  CONTEXT: In the "Greenhouse Gas Inventory Emissions and Absorption Report" submitted to the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change last April, Japan reported 350,000 tons of CO2 absorption
through blue carbon for FY2022.
•  Although Japan's blue carbon absorption capacity was estimated at 520,000 tons in 1990, it has
been declining yearly due to rising sea temperatures.
•  CONTEXT: Japan made history in April 2024 by being the first country to include seaweed-based CO2
absorption in its greenhouse gas inventory submitted to the UN.
•  The govt also plans to report blue carbon absorption in the inventory for FY2023, which is set to be
submitted in April this year.
•  To improve the accuracy of blue carbon calculations, MLIT is developing a new technology that
enables higher-precision measurement of seaweed bed conditions. It involves drones equipped with

laser sensors capable of penetrating underwater to measure the volume of seaweed beds in three
dimensions.


ANRE proposes calculation method for non-fossil value of CCS

thermal power plant co-fired with biomass and fossil fuels (BECCS). According to the agency, the
CO2 storage volume will be calculated based on the existing arrangement for biomass rules under
the Act.
•  CONTEXT: The Act on Sophisticated Methods of Energy Supply Structures requires the use of a certain
percentage of non-fossil energy sources for electricity and other purposes. The law was amended in 2022
to require electric utilities to use CCS, as well as the use of non-fossil energy sources.



MOL and KEPCO ink MoU for carbon credit business
(Company statement, Feb 27)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) and KEPCO signed an MoU to assess the feasibility of projects that

After a Strong First Year, Sales Outlook for Japan’s GX Bonds

Appears Mixed
In February 2024, the Japanese government announced a bold plan to sell ¥20 trillion
worth of bonds directly tied to funding a 10-year, ¥150 trillion GX (green
transformation) agenda. The program is meant to accelerate the nation’s
decarbonization drive to meet a legally mandated net-zero target by 2050.

After a year, about ¥3 trillion worth of the 5- and 10- year bonds, known as ‘GX bonds’
or ‘GX economic transition bonds’, have been sold over six separate rounds of auctions.
That means 15% of the 10-year target has already been reached inside the first 12
months, putting the fundraising ahead of schedule.
But the strong start is showing signs of slowing down. Takeup from outside Japan
(which was around 20% of GX bond sales) has been lower than hoped. It’s a sign that
overseas investors are either unconvinced by the GX plan or simply oblivious to it. In
the world of proliferating green, transition, sustainability and related finance, there’s
been a lack of clear messaging around GX bonds or marketing of them internationally.

International fundraising for decarbonization has admittedly become more difficult
since the re-election of President Donald Trump. The returning U.S. president has rolled
back many of his predecessor’s climate initiatives and waged war on principles like ESG,
instead calling on investors and businesses to recalibrate towards pure profits. The U.S.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright has even dubbed 2050 net zero aspirations as a “terrible”
idea that is costly and inefficient.
With recent elections in Germany suggesting a rebalancing in Europe’s energy stance,
the collective move toward international decarbonization, once so assured, is on shakier
ground.

All this could, despite the wider uncertainty, prove a tailwind for Japan and its green
finance sector.

Despite a change of administration in October that resulted in a minority government,
the country remains socially cohesive and politically stable. State spending on clean
energy is at record levels. METI’s request at the end of last year for an additional ¥982
billion from the supplementary budget for the GX program speaks of a desire to uphold
energy transition goals packaged under the GX banner by the previous Prime Minister
Kishida.
As such, investors who wish to maintain their green energy goals could pivot away from
unpredictable markets in North America and Europe towards Japan. But officials in
Tokyo will need to amplify their GX messaging if they hope to capitalize on Japan’s
status as a financial safe haven.

Headwinds
After a strong start, weaker sales of the GX bonds are projected over coming years. Only
four auctions are scheduled for this coming fiscal year (April 2025 through March
2026) to raise ¥1.2 trillion, compared to six issuances for a total of nearly ¥3 trillion in
the 12 months from February 2024. That’s a 60% dropoff.

October 2025     10-years   Approx. ¥300 billion yen

January 2026     5-year     Approx. ¥300 billion yen

March 2026       10-years   Approx. ¥300 billion yen

The scheduled bond sales will alternate between 5-year and 10-year maturities, and no
sales are currently announced for FY2026, which will start in April 2026.

Assuming the average pace of GX bonds sales from the first two years is maintained, the
government should meet its ¥20-trillion, 10-year fundraising target. However, should
the sales mirror the pace planned for FY2025, then there would be a shortfall of almost
30%.
How government bonds perform affects financing by the private sector. The volume of
green and other decarbonization related bonds by Japanese companies has already
weakened.

NTT Finance, for example, was once Japan’s leading investor in green bonds. Out of a
total of around ¥2 trillions raised in green finance, the company – a financial subsidiary
of the formerly public telecoms monopoly NTT Corp – issued ¥600 billion in green
bonds in 2023 alone. In 2024, that number dropped to zero.

The reasoning provided by companies like NTT is that certain financial products like
green bonds are too restrictive. Green bonds, for example, apply specifically to
investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, wastewater management and
similar. This limits the actions that businesses may want to undertake in other elements
of ESG. In some cases, companies also want to invest in decarbonization technologies
that are not currently accepted within the ‘green’ label.
Another reason for a slowdown in issuances has been waning investor enthusiasm due
to the difficulty of re-sale. While a return on investment is possible with environmental
bonds issued on the primary market, by the time they reach the secondary market, the
chances of turning a profit are greatly reduced.

That is why a large chunk of the GX bond purchases so far, just like general Japanese
government bonds, were made by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and other government-
affiliated entities. At the first auction last February, around 50% of the purchases were
made by either the BoJ (35%) or the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF,
14%).
Given the perceived lack of a ‘greenium’ (green premium) – a lower yield, and therefore
cheaper borrowing costs based on the issuer’s ability to meet its climate targets –
Japanese state entities have experienced trouble reselling the bonds, particularly to
overseas investors. A lack of international awareness of the GX program and scepticism
among some in the green finance community about the merits of the GX strategy have
also played a role.

Overseas Investment
The GX moniker was popularized by the previous Kishida administration to refer to the
nation’s long-standing decarbonization efforts. It dovetailed with another state program,
the DX (digital transformation) initiative, and was largely synonymous with the terms
“net zero” and “decarbonization” in Japanese energy lexicon.
The GX bonds are meant to service a wide range of state initiatives in clean energy,
which span renewables, the introduction of hydrogen and ammonia as fuels, synthetic
fuels, and even a greater use of nuclear power. That broad reach places them into the
category of ‘transition bonds’ rather than the stricter ‘green bonds.’ The ‘transition’ label
allows for various technologies and applications as long as they deliver decarbonization
benefits.

For many western investors, however, the ‘transition’ label feels fuzzy. It also allows for
financing of more contentious technologies, such as the burning of ammonia or
hydrogen alongside coal or natural gas (also known as co-firing). This technology is
opposed by many environmental groups and consultancies such as BloombergNEF.
To add to the confusion, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, the international
organization that reviewed the issuance, GX Bonds do not allow for the allocation of
funding to co-firing but they can be used to finance R&D into such technologies. The
Climate Bonds Initiative says the GX Bond is, to all extents and purposes, a ‘green bond’.
But given the R&D allowance and the broader remits of the GX program in general,
investors find it tough to draw the lines.

With the pool of specifically ‘green’ financing much larger globally than ‘transition’
financing, Japan will need to either persuade international investors of the merits of the
latter or create bonds that cater to international investor interests.
Looking Forward
The Trump administration’s anti-green energy turn has changed the calculus for global
investors and corporations. Last year, BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm,
significantly scaled back its fund allocation to environmental and social issues. On
February 27, BP said it would cut investments in renewables and return focus to oil and
gas.

It’s possible that pressure from the Trump administration or elsewhere will persuade
Japan to tone down its environmental policies and affect GX bond sales. But recent
geopolitical developments could well prove a tailwind for the program. Amid major
international shifts, the stability offered by Japan’s transition bonds will create a sizable
niche.

After all, not all businesses are abandoning their environmental and sustainability goals.
With brisk deregulation in the U.S., Japan’s more stable and steady approach could
make the country appear as a safe haven for environmental financing.
What’s more, Japan’s commitments are deeper than top-level policy. Japanese regions
are struggling with demographic and other socioeconomic challenges and are invested
heavily in the GX vision as a driver of economic revitalization. The regions are boosting
their own spending to attract companies working in GX-related products and services.

Areas such as Hokkaido and Kyushu are competing for the mantle of national GX
leader, and global green finance leaders are more attentive than before to adjusting
various categories to support this enthusiasm.

Last month, Kyoto City sold ¥6 billion in what were labeled as green bonds although the
use of funds is labeled as climate adaptation-oriented riparian works. That area, often
translated as “resilience,” did not get explicitly included in the ‘green’ bond framework
until late in 2024, when the Climate Bond Initiative released an update to its green
bond taxonomy. The update specifically addressed “climate resilience investment
opportunities” as an area for financing.
The broadening of what is termed ‘green’ or what is designated as ‘climate-aligned’ will
always be disputed and some of the GX approach may raise eyebrows. Still, at a time of
uncertainty, Japan’s commitment to GX – and better marketing – could make for an
attractive global proposition.

ANALYSIS

BY ANDREW STATTER

Energy Jobs in Japan: Opportunities in Diversity
Smart Energy Expo at Tokyo Big Sight has always been a major event covering the full
energy and electricity value chains, but this year it was noticeably larger and more
diverse.

The BESS sector has been flooded with new players, primarily from China looking to
capitalize on the growing energy storage market. Hydrogen and ammonia technologies
are having healthy growth of global and domestic technology players as METI’s CfD
scheme sends positive signals to the market.

Grid technology has been clearly highlighted in both the GX and Strategic Energy Plan,
which has led to clear growth in both hardware and software solutions in this space.

As we had previously shared, the new Strategic Energy Plan is shifting to an outlook
where total energy demand will increase, and therefore moving toward a technology
inclusive strategy with a sense of A+B rather than A or B as the path forward for Japan.
How does this play out in the human resource market?

More players, same talent = Supply & demand imbalance
Renewable and BESS developers, power trading firms, fuel cell technology companies,
weather and load forecasting technologies, and hardware OEMs – All these are areas
with more players now than just a couple of years ago. The first movers in any given
area had the advantage to pick up the bilingual, experienced and qualified talent who
were willing to take on a new challenge.

Today, in many segments that willing minority have already made their move, yet more
players hunger for the same talent. The result? It’s the same as the imbalance in the
supply and demand of electricity, we see a price spike. Companies looking to attract the
top talent, those who are ready to ‘plug and play’, will have to pay a premium to attract
them, and are likely to face competition to secure the best hires.
A key example of this imbalance is clear in electrical engineering talent that has an
understanding of grid connection and operations. TSOs have traditionally had a large
workforce of this type of professional, however this pool is being headhunted out to
developers faster than TSOs can replace them - with talent enticed by flatter business
models, higher salaries and more operational freedom. Not only does this affect the
competition for this talent pool, but it also leaves the TSOs understaffed. With record-
high grid connection requests, as PV solar development shifts to higher volume, the
smaller scale projects and LTDA bids for BESS projects are increasing and the TSO grid
teams are becoming overworked, creating a clear bottleneck beyond talent demand.
The next outside talent revolution?
In the early 2010s, with the wild west era of Japan’s lucrative FIT program for
renewable energy projects, the same massive demand on a small talent pool was also
clearly seen. The result was a highly diverse hiring strategy from developers keen to
seize upon the opportunity that the FIT presented. People shifted primarily from sales
and real estate to take on positions in land origination, project development, etc. For
the Japanese talent pool, the focus was taken off industry experience and hard skills,
and people were hired for potential to learn and soft skills such as communication and
commercial sense. Global developers and EPC firms brought experienced people from
20

overseas with hard skills and experience in solar project development, management,
design and construction, regardless of language skills.

As we enter into a more diverse, data-driven and connected energy system, the current
talent market already in the energy industry is again not enough to satisfy the demand
of all players in the market. The need to attract and hire those with transferable skills
from other industries, or bring in talent from energy markets abroad, is increasing
again.
Clarity, attraction and education the keys to success
In order to hire from non-obvious talent pools, hiring companies will need to be clear
on what core skills are necessary, and what is trainable. Can a commodity trader who
understands trading, credit and merchant risk become an asset once you teach her the
intricacies of the power market? How much value can a structural engineer with
experience in European floating wind projects add if you invest in hiring an interpreter
to work alongside him?
Next, the education and attraction pieces will need to go hand in hand. Ambitious talent
flocked to the solar industry in the FIT boom for the simple chance to earn big. This was
the world’s most lucrative FIT program at the time – the attraction piece was akin to a
goldrush in colonial days. Now, with a more complex market and various business
models, telling a clear story to talent and creating a strong unique selling point for your
business is more important than ever.

Onboarding and education are key to making that new hire stick. Approximately 37% of
employees who leave a company do so within their first year. The top reason cited for
leaving during this period is a lack of career development, which could be mitigated by
outlining a clear career roadmap and providing adequate training during the
onboarding process. This is especially important in the current market landscape since
competitors entering the market after you will most certainly have a target laser sighted
on your employees.
Diverse opportunities + diverse talent the way forward?
As the energy market becomes more complex, with multiple asset types emerging as
solutions, opportunities for talent become more diverse. Done right, increasing the mix
of talent from both different industry and technical backgrounds fosters innovation,
adaptability, and competitive advantage.

Diverse experiences bring fresh perspectives that drive problem-solving and the
development of novel solutions. Employees from varied sectors introduce best practices,
enhancing agility and helping companies identify new opportunities while avoiding
industry blind spots. Decision-making improves as different viewpoints challenge deeply
entrenched (and sometimes counterproductive) assumptions and reduce groupthink,
leading to more balanced strategies.
Additionally, technical diversity enhances customer understanding, encourages cross-
disciplinary collaboration, and fosters a culture of continuous learning. This not only
broadens team capabilities but also boosts employee engagement and retention,
ultimately creating a more resilient, innovative, and adaptable workforce.
