Anti-wind mayor elected in Miyagi Pref
(Government statement, Aug 7)
•  Voters in the Kami Township of Miyagi Pref elected Ishiyama Keiki, a former ruling party lawmaker
who has called for cancellation of wind projects in the town.
•  CONTEXT: In June, residents filed an injunction against the incumbent mayor, alleging that he
signed an unfair property lease with an operator planning a 42 MW wind project. The project is

owned by ENEOS and Tohoku Electric.
• TAKEAWAY: Pressures on renewables projects are mounting in Miyagi Pref. On July 19, the local govt and the
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications discussed a new tax on renewables operators clearing forest
areas in the prefecture. There will be more elections in the next three months in municipalities where wind
projects are dividing communities. At this moment, the main complaints locally seem to be directed at onshore
wind developments.

Japan to test seafood daily for tritium following Fukushima water release
(Nikkei Asia, Aug 11)
o  Japan plans to test seafood daily for tritium following the release of treated water from
the Fukushima Daiichi NPP. The Fisheries Agency will conduct the tests near the plant

and publish results within two days.
o  Initial pre-release testing showed no detectable tritium concentrations. The frequency of
testing will be evaluated after two months, based on detection results.
o  Seafood from the area within a 10-km radius of the plant is not currently supplied for
human consumption. The agency previously conducted comprehensive tests, which
found tritium concentrations below detectable levels.



Four EPCOs submit improvement plan to METI over cartel issue
(Jiji, Aug 10)
•  Kansai Electric (KEPCO), Chugoku Electric, Kyushu Electric, and Kyuden Mirai Energy submitted
improvement plans to METI over a suspected sales cartel.
•  In July, METI issued improvement orders to these companies and Chubu Electric, citing frequent

and prolonged information exchange on sales strategies that negatively impacted the electricity
market's development.
•  The improvement plans include creating manuals for communication with other utilities to prevent
cartels and strengthening audit functions through external experts.
•  In late March, the Japan Fair Trade Commission ordered Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric, and
Kyushu Electric to pay more than ¥100 billion in fines for violating antitrust laws. KEPCO, which
self-reported the violation, was not fined.
•  Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric, and Kyushu Electric will contest the fines.



METI presents FY2024 policy proposal at industrial council meeting
(Denki Shimbun Aug 7)
•  METI unveiled proposals for FY2024’s economic and industrial policies during a General Assembly
of the Industrial Structure Council that’s chaired by Tokura Masakazu of the Japan Business

Federation (Keidanren), and serves as an advisory body to METI.
•  METI reaffirmed Fukushima's recovery as a top priority and emphasized goals such as the GX and
ensuring stable energy supply.
•  Support for renewables includes measures in the fields of perovskite solar cells and floating
offshore wind power.
•  Efforts towards decarbonization involve expanding hydrogen and ammonia usage while creating a

supportive regulatory framework for industrial growth. The strategy also outlines gradual expansion
of the "GX League," a carbon credits trading platform overseen by METI, and the realization of
international initiatives like the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC).
•  During the assembly, Kokubun Bunya, a Committee Member and Chairman of Marubeni, noted
that there is a projected surge in electricity demand due to digitalization. He highlighted the
importance of grid enhancement and nuclear power plant restarts. On nuclear energy, he stressed
the necessity of thorough discussions on matters like Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) introduction.

Used cooking oil supplies decrease in FY2022 as restaurants cut oil consumption
(Japan NRG, Aug 9)
•  Used cooking oil (UCO) supplies decreased in FY2022 as restaurants and households cut oil
consumption to save costs, according to the Japan Federation of UC Oil Business Cooperation

Associations.
•  In FY2022, 380,000 tons of UCO were generated, down 5% from 400,000 tons a year earlier. Out
of the 380,000 tons, 360,000 tons were collected. The collected amount was also down 5% from a
year ago.
•  120,000 tons were exported, flat from last year.
•  UCO export prices in June softened to ¥159.2/kg from an all time high of ¥199.1/kg in Oct last
year. The EU, which had been the biggest UCO buyer, has cut imports on concerns over “fake

UCO” from China.

UCO consumption breakdown


FY2022               FY2021

Exports               32%                  31%

Livestock feed          49%                  51%


Industrial chemicals      12%                  13%

Domestic fuel           4%                   2%

Unrecyclable grade        3%                   3%


•  CONTEXT: Japan’s UCO demand will potentially rise above 2.3 million tons/year as over 1.5
million tons/year are required for sustainable aviation fuel. In an effort to increase its supplies, oil
collection from households through local municipality offices and supermarket chains, as well as
recovering oil from wastewater, have been strengthened since 2017.
• TAKEAWAY: The UCO classification changed to industrial feedstock from industrial waste recently, allowing

market entry from retail and other businesses that do not have waste treatment licenses. High UCO prices
driven by strong export demand is another strong incentive to collect the oil. The UCO export price was
¥70.4/kg in April 2021 before the EU demand boom.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Ito-Yokado collects used cooking oil from Tokyo households
(Company statement, Aug 3)
o  Ito-Yokado supermarket began collecting used cooking oil (UCO) from households in
Tokyo, partnering with ENEOS, Seven & I Group, 7-Eleven Japan, Nomura Jimusho,
Yoshikawa Oil, etc. The UCO will be processed into SAF and other products.
o  ENEOS and Nomura Jimusho will provide consumers with dedicated returnable bottles

that can be repeatedly used to collect UCO. Yoshikawa Oil will process and refine the
UCO and supply it to ENEOS to produce SAF.

NR-Power Lab to launch pilot VPP with world’s first decentralized security system
(Japan NRG, Aug 9)
•  In 2024, NR-Power Lab plans a pilot virtual power plant (VPP) with the world’s first decentralized
power source identification system; with commercialization in 2026.
•  Developed by CollaboGate Japan, this system is a type of blockchain to authenticate individual

power sources by issuing IDs. This is expected to reduce cyber security costs that inflate as the
number of power sources and users increase.
•  The VPP consists of CollaboGate Japan’s ID platform, Sassor’s AI-based energy forecast and
management systems, storage batteries and other devices. Hokkaido Electric, a user of NGK’s
sodium sulfide storage batteries, will join as an observer.
•  The project locations will likely be in Hokkaido or the Kanto area.

•  CONTEXT: NR-Power Lab is a JV of NGK Insulators and Ricoh focusing on VPPs.
• TAKEAWAY: VPPs raise energy efficiency by balancing supply with demand, and bundling small varied power
sources in an area. They’re getting more traction as it becomes more difficult to launch large renewables
projects in Japan. However, they could be exposed to higher cybersecurity risks as power sources diversify.
Also, security system costs rise as operator liabilities, as defined in METI guidelines, expand.




Idemitsu, Hatch Blue to explore carbon opportunities
(Company statement, Aug 7)
•  Idemitsu Kosan and U.S.-based blue carbon investor Hatch Blue agreed to explore ocean-based

carbon capture opportunities in Japan. Idemitsu will also invest in Hatch’s Blue Revolution Fund.
•  CONTEXT: Japan launched the J Blue Credit system in 2020, covering carbon that’s incorporated
into marine ecosystems, such as seagrass. A total of 21 projects were awarded “blue” offset credits
to date.
• TAKEAWAY: The biggest “blue” carbon development in Japan so far is Sumitomo Corp’s Hirono Town
Seaweed Project (Iwate Pref) that earned credits equivalent to 3,106 tons of CO2. Japan’s blue carbon
potential is estimated at 4-5 million tons/ year, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and

Tourism.



Mitsui extends JV with Celanese for methanol production

(Nikkan Kogyo, Aug 8)
•  Mitsui extended until 2045 its JV with chemical company Celanese (U.S.) that produces low-carbon
methanol from captured CO2 at a Texas plant.
•  Annual production capacity will grow by 130,000 tons to around 1.63 million tons; the upgraded
facilities will incorporate up to 180,000 tons of recovered CO2 per year.
•  Fairway Methanol uses natural gas and CO2 from nearby factories as raw materials.
•  CONTEXT: In July, Mitsui also invested in Kasso MidCo, a Danish company producing low-carbon

•  JFE is a major pipeline builder and has experience of injecting CO2 deep underground.















Skylark HD opens its first zero-emission restaurant in Tokyo

(Company statement, Aug 8)
•  Skylark HD opened a new “Gusto” brand restaurant in Higashi Murayama equipped with roof-top
solar. It claims to use CO2-free electricity and “carbon-neutral” city gas.
•  The roof-top solar can provide 30% of the restaurant’s energy. The remainder will be sourced from
CD Energy Direct with non-fossil certification.
•  CONTEXT: Skylark has over 2,900 restaurants across Japan under different brands such as
Bamiyan, Syabu-yo, Jonathan’s, Yumean, and Gusto. Once this trial is successful, Skylark says it will
push other restaurants in its group to embrace zero-emission measures.

Toshiba takeover begins with JIP consortium bid worth about ¥2 trillion
(Company statement, various media, Aug 7)
•  Toshiba announced a tender offer by a consortium led by private equity firm Japan Industrial
Partners (JIP). The offer is ¥4,620 per share and it’s valid for 30 business days until Sept 20. The
offer will be deemed successful if more than two-thirds of the voting rights of total shares are
tendered.

•  Following a successful offer, Toshiba will undergo a period of delisting and aim for growth under
the leadership of the JIP consortium. The total value of the offer for Toshiba is about ¥2 trillion.
•  The consortium is led by JIP, but includes a number of major Japanese industrial companies, some
of which have business relations or wish to pursue joint opportunities with Toshiba. These include
ORIX, ROHM, and NGK Insulators. It's anticipated that Chubu Electric will also participate.
•  CONTEXT: After a series of management and financial scandals, Toshiba in 2017 raised new

capital from a number of activist funds, which have subsequently called on the company to take
drastic measures to revamp its business. In part due to a difference of opinions between Toshiba
stakeholders, the company has decided to delist and then restructure.
• TAKEAWAY: Toshiba is one of Japan’s main companies in the energy industry, involved in everything from
R&D of new-gen solar cells, hydrogen systems, power generation plants, VPPs and the cleanup at the
Fukushima Daiichi NPP site. The company has been hampered in recent years with shareholder disputes and
operating and financial scandals, but its restructuring is expected to play a big role in a number of energy

fields, including nuclear. The government has not given up on the idea of creating a national leader in nuclear
tech on the basis of several companies and Toshiba could play a role there.



Power futures trading volumes drop on EEX and TOCOM in June
(Japan NRG, Denki Shimbun, Aug 8)
•  In June, the power futures trading volumes dropped both on the EEX and the TOCOM platforms.
•  EEX saw its trading volume decline by 28.7% compared to the previous month to 984.84 GWh.
This is the first time the volume dipped below 1,000 GWh since December 2022.
•  Trading on JPX’s TOCOM platform decreased by 54.6% compared to the previous month,
reaching 99.28 GWh. This significant drop is in part due to the highs reached in May, which posted

the second-highest monthly trading volume since the market's inception.
•  A restraint in spot electricity price increases and volatility likely contributed to lower hedging
demand. This was most pronounced in the East Area Baseload contracts.
•  While trading volumes decreased, open interest (positions that have not been offset by opposite
trades) increased by 9.4% from the previous month, reaching 411.75 GWh, the highest in at least
five months and the third-highest ever.
• TAKEAWAY: For a historical overview of futures market volumes, please see our monthly Data Book report,

published in the first few days of each month.

IPP share of retail power sales drops to 17.7%

(Government data, Aug 8)
•  As of March, independent power providers (IPP) had 17.7% share of the power retail market, falling
21.3% YoY.
•  IPPs had a 23.8% share of low-voltage services for consumers and small businesses; 18.7% of high-
voltage services and 6.8% of ultra-high voltage services for industry.
•  As of March, there were 721 power retailers.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE’s suggestions to improve competition

(Government statement, Aug 8)
o  ANRE summarized discussions to prevent former regional power monopolies, (EPCOs),
from accessing customer data of IPPs connecting to their networks.
o  Proposed measures include separating the EPCOs from IPPs, and conducting third-party
reviews to ensure that IPP data is protected; keeping access records of sensitive data and
reviewing them regularly.

o  As far as the idea to fully separate the power transmission arm of EPCOs from their
groups, ANRE said it’s not realistic because it possibly violates constitutional asset rights
[of EPCOs]. There may be problems during emergencies; and securing investment will be
more difficult as separate entities.



Kyushu Electric: High-voltage customers to face market prices from FY2024
(Denki Shimbun, Aug 8)
•  Kyushu Electric introduced a new standard menu for high-voltage and above power contracts that
reflects price fluctuations in the wholesale power market.
•  Effective from Oct 1, this will incorporate monthly market price fluctuations due to sourcing a

certain amount of electricity from the wholesale (spot) market.
•  Existing high-voltage customers will switch to pricing that reflects market price fluctuations from
FY2024.
•  This move is expected to accommodate most of Kyushu Electric's customers, including those
seeking a final guarantee of supply from Kyushu Electric's transmission and distribution uni, as well
as those wishing to switch from new electricity providers.

METI launches panel to oversee new balancing market design
(Denki Shimbun, Aug 10)
•  The Energy Agency and regional organizations began the detailed design of a new balancing
market that would merge trades in kilowatt-hours (electricity) and delta kilowatts (supply-demand

adjustment), offering a product for a week before actual supply/demand through to the day-
before.
•  This initiative was discussed at an expert meeting held by METI, which is also closely monitoring
progress in unifying the central supply instruction system that’s been undertaken by power
transmission and distribution companies.
•  The ministry’s goal is to confirm the new market plan, conduct a cost-benefit analysis, and assess
its validity within about a year. This would allow for the operational launch of the market no earlier

than FY2028.
•  CONTEXT: The rationale for the new market is that it would be more efficient at utilizing various
power sources and it will need to take into consideration not only generation itself but the time
and cost of starting electricity plants.



KEPCO’s Takahama NPP Unit 2 to restart on Sept 15

(Asahi Shimbun, Aug 8)
•  After 47 years of operation, KEPCO's Takahama NPP's Unit 2 began loading fuel into its reactor. If

ANALYSIS

BY MASUTOMO TAKEHIRO

Hokkaido’s Silicon Valley Dream Hinges On Energy Adjustment
Can Hokkaido turn into the next Silicon Valley? The state-backed semiconductor firm
Rapidus unveiled a plan to establish a factory in Japan’s northernmost region, which
offers vast amounts of land at a low price and a cool climate suitable for
manufacturing. However, there are mounting challenges to overcome, including
energy-related ones.

Founded in August last year, Rapidus aims to quickly become a top player in the
semiconductor sector, (Rapidus meaning “swift” in Latin). The Tokyo-based firm was
formed with a modest investment of ¥7.3 billion from eight prominent Japanese
companies, including Toyota, NTT, Sony, SoftBank, Kioxia, Denso, NEC, and
Mitsubishi UFJ Bank. Additionally, Rapidus has received ¥70 billion in government
subsidies, with METI potentially injecting an additional ¥300 billion.

Rapidus envisions creating a “Hokkaido Valley” stretching from Ishikari, a new hub for
data centers, to Tomakomai, a major port on the Pacific coast. It will encompass
Sapporo, a city of two million, and Chitose, the area around the main international
airport for Hokkaido. The establishment of a new cutting-edge chip factory should lure
makers of production equipment and materials to the area, further boosting the local
economy. Coupled with TSMC's preparation for chip production in Kumamoto, the
Hokkaido initiative is expected to complement Japan's overall semiconductor
strategy.

The key thing to keep in mind is that semiconductor manufacturing is one of the
world’s most energy intensive industrial processes. It has also traditionally been one of
the most polluting, with chip foundries running mainly on baseload thermal power.
The main buyers of chips, however, are the world’s top tech companies such as Apple
and Google, which have announced commitments to a net-zero supply chain by the
end of this decade. That means that the Rapidus project will not only need to create a
world-leading chip manufacturing hub almost from scratch. It will also have to be
powered by clean energy.

The conditions could help spur a major rollout of renewables in the Hokkaido area.

Govt announces formation of Team Sapporo-Hokkaido to promote clean energy in the region

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

BACKGROUND
In June this year, Hokkaido Prefecture and Sapporo City created a “Team Sapporo-Hokkaido”, composed
of 21 companies including Hokkaido Electric, Hokkaido Gas, financial companies, etc., to act as a local
arm of the national GX (green transformation) strategy. This is the first such regional GX hub and shows
the importance that PM Kishida’s government has attached to the industrial potential of Hokkaido and its
ability to act as a magnet for new clean energy developments, including in financing.




A very rapid timeline
Rapidus is slated to begin construction on the Chitose site in September, aiming to
have an early test line for two-nanometer (2nm) advanced chip in 2025, followed by
full-scale production in 2027. The president of Rapidus, Koike Atsuyoshi, an ex-Hitachi
executive, stated in a recent interview that the company plans three to four
manufacturing facilities on the site.
Such a quick development would be almost impossible to conduct with Japan’s

resources alone. That’s why this project is founded on a broad collaboration between
Japan, the U.S., and the EU. IBM will act as the main developer of the advanced 2nm
chips. Rapidus staff have already started to travel to the Albany Nanotech Complex,
IBM's semiconductor research facility in New York. Also, Rapidus and the Belgian
research institute, IMEC, announced their long-term collaboration, with the former
seeking guidance on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, a vital technology for
semiconductor manufacturing.
On the financial front, Rapidus would require an investment of ¥2 trillion for the
prototype launch by 2025, and an additional ¥3 trillion by 2027 for full-scale
production. However, it remains unclear who will shoulder this burden. Rapidus
intends to pursue an IPO eventually.

During a semiconductor sector event in 2022, Prime Minister Kishida made a surprise
appearance and stressed the importance of the chip industry in supporting domestic
industries sustainably. Furthermore, he recently promised to provide “necessary
support” to Rapidus.

Nonetheless, skepticism about the project's success remains. Despite maintaining a
significant share of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials
industries, Japan is considered to be 20 years behind in terms of cutting-edge chip
production. There are questions regarding who will develop the new technologies,
how IBM’s lack of manufacturing input will be compensated for, whether a broad
range of highly skilled personnel can be acquired, and the lack of specific customers
beyond automotive manufacturers.

Rapidus says it will adopt a new business model called Rapid and Unified
Manufacturing Service, (RUMS), wherein they handle all aspects of chip production,
from design to manufacturing and implementation, based on customer semiconductor
product plans.

Still, despite the company's frequent use of flashy new terms, its business model is
ambiguous.

Powering the revolution
To produce semiconductors a large amount of stable electricity supply is needed.
Environmentally conscious firms such as Microsoft and Apple demand fully green
energy sources for chip production, which means Rapidus cannot rely on the current
backbone of Japan’s energy system – the fleet of coal and gas-fired power stations.

In this regard, Hokkaido is well-positioned. Among Japan’s 47 prefectures, it boasts
one of the highest potentials for renewable energy. On the Sea of Japan side, strong
winds throughout the year make it optimal for offshore wind power generation. The
government has already selected five locations, including off the coast of Ishikari and
Hiyama, as “promising areas” for renewable energy development. Construction of a
mid-size 112 MW offshore wind power farm off the coast of Ishikari began in July.

Onshore wind power is also promising. Half of the national potential for onshore wind
capacity is concentrated in Hokkaido. The nation’s top wind power player, Eurus
Energy, is developing one of Japan’s largest onshore power generation facilities (47.5
MW) in the prefecture.

Small and medium-scale hydropower generation is also feasible, while the flat lands of
the island make Hokkaido suitable for utility scale solar despite its northern location.

Hokkaido Governor Suzuki set a 2050 net-zero emissions target for the prefecture
even before then PM Suga made it a national pledge in late 2020.

Turning this green energy potential into reality won’t be straightforward. Similar to
other regions in Japan, opposition to renewable energy facilities has emerged in
various areas of Hokkaido due to concerns about the impact on landscape and nature.
A recent onshore wind project planned by trading house Sojitz in Otaru City was
canceled for that very reason.

Hokkaido Electric is also closely watching Rapidus, having established a dedicated
organization to provide it with energy supply services. While it is unclear how much
energy Rapidus will consume, by 2027 the local utility hopes to be able to finally
switch on its Tomari Nuclear Power Plant, which has been dogged by regulator
inspections for about ten years.

President Saito Susumu noted in a recent media interview: “Of course, we will procure
renewable energy and increase the amount. We will also promote nuclear power (to
Rapidus).” The utility currently holds 1.79 GW of renewable energy capacity, mainly in
hydropower. But renewables accounted for only 14% of its total electricity sales in
FY2021.


A catalyst for change
Even with a substantial increase in renewable energy generation, the demand for
electricity in Hokkaido remains low. Most green power projects to date have imagined
the buildout of new power lines to connect Hokkaido with the mainland, especially
with the Tokyo metropolitan area that houses most of the population and industry.

The government has plans to build an undersea grid system that would cater to new
offshore wind farms east and north of Hokkaido. The plan was approved by PM
Kishida-led GX Implementation Council in December 2022, which set a completion

18


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

target for 2030.

According to the undersea grid plan, transmission lines able to carry 4 GW of power
capacity would stretch from the Sea of Japan side and a further 2 GW of lines would
lie on the Pacific side. However, the distance between Hokkaido and Tokyo is over
1,000 kilometers and the cost and logistics of such an overtaking are expected to be
challenging. Current estimates suggest at least two to four trillion yen would need to
be put aside.

In addition, a strong buildout of storage batteries would also be required to balance
out the variable generation from wind farms, according to Hokkaido Electric.

With such cost comes also the challenge of apportioning payment. Many fear that
ultimately the costs will be passed on to consumers, packaged as a necessary green
premium.

A way to lower the infrastructure investments would be to bring energy intensive
industries closer to the source of electricity generation. Which explains why in recent
overseas trips, Japanese officials have offered Middle East and Indian counterparts
the idea of investing both in clean energy and semiconductor developments at home.


Politics
The announcement of Rapidus’ expansion into Hokkaido came two months before the
local gubernatorial election, essentially providing tailwinds to the incumbent Governor
Suzuki. Former Prime Minister Suga praised him during a campaign rally, highlighting
his success in “attracting an advanced semiconductor manufacturer's factory using his
youth and proactive attitude”.

At the age of only 42, Governor Suzuki has had an unusual political career, having
risen from a Tokyo Metropolitan Government official to be elected mayor of the
bankrupt city of Yubari. He is expected to have a promising future probably in central
politics and is also an alumnus of the same university as Suga. Amid the waning
popularity of Prime Minister Kishida, Suga's influence seems to be reviving. How
national politics plays out in Japan’s political hub of Nagatacho may affect the
progress of this ambitious project in the long term.

Hokkaido’s Silicon Valley dream is still at a nascent stage. But with so many political,
geopolitical and economic considerations on the line, it is likely to amass the energy
to succeed.

ENERGY       JOBS   IN  JAPAN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Contract vs Permanent Hiring

As the energy market changes and grows, the talent shortage is clearly apparent. For
firms new to Japan and uncertain about project volume and staffing needs, as well as
companies with a fluctuating workload, employing temporary contract workers can be
an attractive solution. Like many things in Japan, however, from the business culture
to square watermelons, contract employment is not quite the same as in many other
countries.


The image of contract workers
Japanese society places a high value on stability. This directly impacts one’s ability to
borrow money, gain access to higher class rental apartments, and approval from
fathers for their daughter's hand in marriage!

Working in a reputable, stable, well-known firm typically holds more weight than the
individual’s income. For example, a lender will assess both the individual and their
employer, and possibly refuse credit based on the latter’s reputation and status, or
the length of employment and overall work conditions.

Compared to countries such as the UK or the U.S. that have a robust market for
freelancers who choose projects that satisfy their interest or pay over permanent work,
Japan has a rather tepid freelancer community. There are exceptions, in particular in
the tech space, where software developers, SAP experts, etc, have increasingly turned
to freelancing due to project-based work. In general, however, visa challenges make it
difficult for Japan to build a strong base of foreign highly-skilled freelancers.

Non-Japanese citizens that wish to work either require visa sponsorship from an
employer or a spouse, both of which require permanent commitments. The other
option is to set up your own firm in Japan and apply for a business visa, the
requirements of which include sinking a sizable amount of capital into the entity or
hiring two full-time staff.

Temporary recruitment agencies, however, are very active in Japan. Adecco, Recruit
and other major players have large pools of talent who are outsourced as contract
(haken) staff. This cadre is good for operational roles in organizations, where lower
degrees of training are required and where staff can be replaced quickly and relatively
easily. Administration, customer service, order management, and bookkeeping are
examples of functions that can be outsourced in Japan without much trouble .

When highly specialized skills are required, whether it be a particular path of
engineering, financial modeling, commercial negotiations, etc, then the contract
worker option tends to fall short. Though some candidates are available, they’re rarely
the best in the market.

Employers in Japan can be quite critical of those who have taken contract work in the
past. In the eyes of many human resource departments, those who took a contract
position must have done so because they couldn't secure permanent

20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

employment. Often, contractors are seen as ‘job hoppers’ by companies, and
therefore struggle to transition from contractor status to a permanent employee.


When to use contractors

Senior hires
Most Japanese companies cease full-time employment at 60 years old, and even start
winding down their career at 55. A select few progress to the highest echelons of the
business and compete for C-suite roles, but for most of the older employees, the last
few years will see them take on roles of lower responsibility and remuneration to make
way for the next wave. This is a product of the seniority system embedded in
Japanese business culture, leaving veteran staff that either didn’t wish to or could not
secure top management positions declining rather than gaining social status around
retirement age.

As many smaller or multinational companies recognise, many of these experienced
talents have a wealth of value. Their depth of knowledge and network can bring
credibility to a foreign firm when it engages with local stakeholders, business partners,
financiers, etc. Often, these professionals are motivated by the contribution they can
make, and therefore can be hired on direct, fixed-term or rolling contracts as
(keiyakushain). These are somewhat different from outsourced contract workers
(hakenshain).

In lieu of a probationary period
Your permanent employment contract likely has a probation period, usually 3 or 6
months that allows you to assess performance and let the worker go if needed. The
problem is that all employment contracts are superseded by Japanese labor law,
which gives full protection to the employee after two weeks. Offering an initial
contract with an option to full-time employment gives you security to assess
performance, and either extend the contract, let the employee leave, or switch to full-
time employment without getting caught in a legal bind.

The catch is that you are offloading the risk onto the shoulders of the employee, and
in a stability valued market such as Japan, this can put your offer at a competitive
disadvantage if that candidate is in demand from multiple organizations.


Times are changing, slowly
Though not as far advanced as European or U.S. markets, diversity and inclusion
initiatives are on the rise in Japan, which has traditionally been male-dominated in
upper management and highly technical areas. In the past, it was common for women
to give up their careers in favor of bearing children and shifting into family life. These
days however, an increasing number of female professionals take on contract work
during the early years of raising a family. This allows them to diversify and broaden
their skill sets, and then jump back into full-time employment as home responsibilities
change. Work-from-home and hybrid setups precipitated by Covid have certainly
been a factor in accelerating this.

Secondarily, there’s an increasing number of professionals taking on post-graduate
studies mid-career and paying for them from their own pocket so as not to be tied to
company clawback schemes that can extend for years after graduation. Many of these

21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

aspiring young professionals will take on contract work during their study to build up
experience and increase their market value upon graduation. Often, these more
ambitiously minded individuals are open to fixed-term commitments that pay well and
offer more flexibility to utilize their newfound knowledge.

Will Japan soon see a numerous, highly-skilled, flexible and mobile freelance
workforce that’s willing to work on a project-by-project basis? Probably not, but the
current generation of younger workers are certainly breaking free from the shackles of
societal and company expectations that have been deeply ingrained for decades.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ LNG
Two LNG producers held talks with unions to try to stave off a strike that could disrupt
global supplies. The three LNG sites, owned by Woodside Energy and Chevron,
account for 10% of global supply and half of Australia’s LNG output.

Canada/ LNG
Tourmaline Oil Corp joined Rockies LNG, a group of producers working on the 12
mmt Ksi Lisims project on British Columbia’s coast. Rockies LNG’s members produce
5.6 billion cfpd, about a third of Canada’s output. Texas-based Western LNG also is
involved.

EU/ Energy crisis
E.ON, Europe's biggest operator of energy networks, said the continent's energy
crisis will continue. CEO Leonhard Birnbaum said: "We must continue to work on the
issue of austerity. This is the best way to ensure affordability for customers and also to
achieve competitiveness of our society and our economy."

EU/ gas prices
Gas prices on the Title Transfer Facility, the European benchmark, rose to €43 per
MW/h, up from €30 on Aug 8. The increase was triggered by reports of a possible
strike at LNG plants in Australia.
France/ power markets
Thanks to its nuclear capacity, in the first half of this year France surpassed Sweden to
become Europe’s top power exporter; however, Germany has moved from exporter
to importer. France’s total power exports amounted to 17.6 TW/h, mostly flowing to
the UK and Italy.

Germany/ Wind power
Siemens Energy expects a €4.5 billion loss this year, struggling to fix its ailing wind
turbine business. The company had previously predicted losses for 2023 that would
exceed last year’s €712 million loss by a "low triple-digit-million".

India/ Oil demand
Consumption of petroleum products in the world’s third-largest crude importer
increased 10%, to about 223 million tons in 2022/ 2023. Higher demand was due to
strong economic growth, an increase in vehicle sales, and growing industrialization
and urbanization.

Poland/ Oil pipeline
After detecting a leak last week, national pipeline operator PERN halted pumping
through a section of the Druzhba pipeline that connects Russia to Europe. It expects
flows to resume this coming week. PERN said there was no indication that a third
party had caused the leak.

The govt will struggle to attract new offshore wind projects under its current auction
round due to recent sharp cost increases for developers, said Mads Nipper, CEO of
Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore developer. He added that the maximum electricity
price was not high enough to offset wind companies’ rising costs.

U.S./ Carbon removal
The Energy Dept is awarding up to $1.2 billion for two projects in Texas that will
directly remove CO2 from the air; this would be the largest investment ever in
engineered carbon removal. Once fully operational, it will scale up to remove 30 mmt/
year.
