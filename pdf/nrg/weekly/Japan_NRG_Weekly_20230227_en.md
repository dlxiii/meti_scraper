Kishida asks METI minister to directly engage with power rate hike reviews

(Government statement, Feb. 24)
•  Prime Minister Kishida has asked METI minister Nishimura to directly engage with power rate hike
reviews during the ministers’ taskforce meeting on inflation, wage and livelihood issues.
•  Kishida urged minister Nishimura to consider management efficiency of the companies, the recent
exchange rate moves and fuel market prices in the reviews, and come up with measures to better
control power rates. Nishimura is to complete these tasks in March.
•  CONTEXT: In January, regional power companies applied to METI for rate hikes. Presently METI is
soliciting the general public to submit opinions. The public consultation period ends in mid-April.

• TAKEAWAY: PM Kishida knows that utility prices is a sensitive issue and faces local elections in April. No
matter how much industry protests, he wants to show the government is being tough to protect the
population. But the economics of power generation in an age of elevated fuel prices cannot be ignored for
long. Even with the recent easing in global gas and coal prices, power utilities will hope that they get at least a
partial approval of their sought price increases.



METI to set up working group to drive EVs’ integration into power network
(Japan NRG, Feb. 21)
•  METI plans to set up a working group to drive EVs’ integration into grid networks, to identify data

types needed to control power transmission traffic, as well as data specifications and standards for
sharing data among varied players, and etc.
•  The working group will be set up by the end of March 2024, and members will include automakers,
charging systems makers, charging service providers, regional electric power operators, power
retailers, aggregators, data platform operators and scholars.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s EV sales in 2022 were 26,465 vehicles, or 0.9% of total passenger car sales. In
this sector, Japan has fallen behind the EU and the U.S., which are developing data and

communication standards to connect EVs with power networks. The METI working group aims to
catch up with international competitors.
• TAKEAWAY: Potential network issues include a sudden surge in the EV charging demand affecting power
transmission elsewhere, and a lack of consistent standards among electrical systems at homes, offices and
power facilities, making power charging and discharging inefficient. The biggest challenge is that on the back
of slow EV spread Japan has little data to make base assumptions.



Transition finance panel publishes briefing paper on financed emissions
(Government statement, Feb. 20)
•  A government-private sector panel on transition finance published a briefing paper identifying

issues for financial institutions working on climate initiatives.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The panel, called the sub-working group of government and the private sector on financed
emissions to promote transition finance, has proposed a disclosure system designed to encourage
emission cut engagements.
•  Going forward, it will propose calculations, disclosure and other rules to G7, G20 and other
international frameworks.

•  CONTEXT: The new sub-working group, includes METI, the MoE, the Financial Services Agency,
and representatives from MUFJ, SMBC, Mizuho FG, Nomura group, BofA, Dai-ichi Life, Nippon
Life, Tokio Marine Holdings, and Asset Management One.



ANRE to establish new divisions for ammonia, hydrogen and carbon resources in summer

(Japan NRG, Feb. 22)
•  ANRE will establish a Hydrogen and Ammonia Division in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Department.
•  The Carbon Resources Division will be created in the Natural Resources and Fuel Department.
•  The Petroleum and Natural Gas Division will be renamed as the Fuel Resource Development
Division.
•  The Petroleum Refining and Reserve Division, and the Petroleum Distribution and Retail Division,

will merge. Biofuel and bioethanol will also fall under the new unit.
•  The Coal Division, and the Mineral and Natural Resources Division, will merge.



NRA met to discuss new rules for NPPs operating more than 60 years
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 22)
•  The NRA hosted its first meeting to discuss the new regulation that allows nuclear reactors to

operate for more than 60 years.
•  CONTEXT: The present rules allow operation for 40 years, and one 20 year extension. However,
the NRA changed the rules so that it will have powers to review operational safety every decade
after 30 years. This effectively changes the potential license period.
•  CONTEXT: To make the matter more complicated, recent METI rule changes allow operators to
discount the years spent idle post Fukushima from the licensing term. That could see some
reactors operate more than 70 years after they first entered service. Again, the NRA would need to

sign off on the safety standards every 10 years in operation starting from the 30-year mark.
•  The NRA said that it doesn’t expect major changes in the general outline of regulation since it has
introduced its new rules. For facilities that are over 60 years in service, it will refer to U.S.
experience in the field.
• TAKEAWAY: If the new regulation adheres fundamentally to the current one, then the essence won’t change
substantially. Therefore, it seems METI is trying to bolster the perception that nuclear safety is being increased

by requiring inspection every 10 years, and yet, also easing concerns about NPPs being in service for more
than 60 years.

180 MW will be installed; 40% of the electricity used at the airport will be supplied by solar power.
•  By 2050, the new company will locally produce and consume e-methane (synthetic methane).
Hydrogen will be produced from PVs at the airport, and e-methane will be produced by
methanation and supplied as fuel to the main electricity distribution station.



TEPCO PG launches Japan’s first SF6 gas-free GIS

(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 21)
•  Tokyo Electric Power Grid (PG) started Japan’s first gas insulated switchgear (GIS) that does not
use the greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).
•  Two GIS lines by Toshiba Energy Systems (Toshiba EES) were installed in Fuchu City, Tokyo. By
using a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen (dry air) as insulating gas, there’ll be a 470-ton reduction
(of CO2 equivalent) of SF6 gas over 50 years.
•  SF6 has 25,000 times more GHG concentration than CO2.

•  CONTEXT: In Japan, SF6 is used in GIS because of its insulation performance, odourlessness, non-
flammability, colourlessness, and ease of handling. However, at the COP3 in Kyoto in 1997 it was
designated as a GHG subject to emission reductions. TEPCO PG has been studying alternatives to
SF6 since 2016 and intends to further promote them in the next few years.



Three major chemical companies join forces on carbon neutrality in Keiyo Rinkai Complex

(Company statement, Feb. 13)
•  Sumitomo Chemical, Maruzen Petrochemical, and Mitsui Chemical signed an MoU to accelerate
carbon neutrality in the Keiyo Rinkai Industrial Complex in Chiba by reducing GHG emissions and
transitioning to greener sources of power.
•  In 2020, the chemical industry was responsible for 15% of Japan’s total CO2 emissions.

iron reduction without any use of coal.
• TAKEAWAY: High-coking coal prices and the need to replace Russian coal are driving steelmakers to secure
new supplies. Nippon Steel spent over ¥100 billion in the last five years for facility upgrades to cut carbon.

These costs will eventually be figured into the prices of steel used for vehicles and wind power equipment.



Sumitomo Corp signs sales agreement with U.S. MP Materials for rare earths

(Japan NRG, Feb. 21)
•  Sumitomo Corp signed an agreement with U.S.-based MP Materials to sell its neodymium-
praseodymium (NdPr) oxide products exclusively to Japanese manufacturers of magnets for cars
and wind turbines. NdPr products will be produced at the Mountain Pass facility in California.
•  MP is building a facility that separates rare earth elements from concentrate ores, to be completed
by April. The U.S. Department of Defense granted $35 million to the project, to process the ore
concentrate on-site instead of shipping the raw materials to China.
•  Sumitomo’s exclusive sales license will not cover lanthanum, cerium, yttrium, samarium and

europium, also produced at Mount Pass and used for batteries.
•  MP Materials’ customers include General Motors which buys Neodymium-iron -boron (NdFeB)
supplies on a long-term contract.
•  CONTEXT: The Mountain Pass facility is the largest rare earth production site in the Western
Hemisphere, with an annual output of over 40,000 tons/ year. The new processing facility aligns
with U.S. government policies to reduce rare earth dependency on China.

• TAKEAWAY: Sumitomo will also help MP Materials identify outsourcing partners in Thailand, Malaysia and
Vietnam to build a global rare earth supply chain from ore extraction to magnet production. As the Mountain
Pass output is very large, intermediate processing needs to be split among multiple plants in diverse locations.

Japan’s Makers of Thermal Power Equipment
Seek to Confront and Adjust to the Energy Transition

Alongside a national pledge to cut emissions and use more green energy, there’s one
more indicator that shows Japan’s reliance on fossil fuels is on the wane.

At the end of last year, two major Japanese suppliers of equipment for coal and gas-
fired plants announced plans to merge their thermal generation business. While both
companies have “Mitsubishi” in their name, referring to their roots as once being part
of Japan’s biggest industrial zaibatsu grouping, this is by no means a happy marriage,
especially for the employees.

The fact that Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) still went ahead
and announced plans to integrate their thermal power business is significant. In a
historical sense, it brings the multiple restructurings of the Mitsubishi electrical
equipment empire back full circle – almost 100 years on from its first asset split. It also
marks a turning point for Japan’s power equipment industry, reflecting the global
trend of moving away from the burning of fossil fuels for electricity.

In the late 20th century, Japan had enough big players producing equipment for oil,
coal and gas-fired power plants to field a sports team. The transition to cleaner energy
has put tremendous pressure on the sector, which is now rapidly, if reluctantly,
consolidating to survive. But will the merged entities find a place in the energy
transition’s brave new world?


Background
In late December 2022, Mitsubishi Electric and MHI said they’ll form a JV to integrate
their respective thermal power technologies and assets. Mitsubishi Electric is
expected to be the majority shareholder of the new company, the name of which is
still not known, and the merger is expected to be completed by April 2024.

The companies seek to improve competitiveness in a world focused on carbon-
neutrality by pooling resources, which would help them offer cleaner thermal power
products; for example, by helping to convert thermal plants to burn hydrogen and
ammonia.

Mitsubishi Electric was created in 1921 when the electrical equipment business of MHI
(then known as Mitsubishi Zosen) was spun off. Post-war Japan saw the power industry
dominated by four major companies and several second-tier suppliers. As the
economy grew rapidly after the war, demand for power also increased, continuing to
the very end of the 20th century.

Many companies supplied equipment to produce electricity and also transport it
(known as Transmission & Distribution, or T&D). First, there were the big players,
including Toshiba, Hitachi, MHI and Mitsubishi Electric, that supplied equipment for
large power plants and substations. Then, there was a group of smaller players that

were also specialists in certain areas. This group included Meidensha, Nisshin Electric,
Takaoka Electric and Fuji Electric.

However, the domestic market started to shrink as it became saturated and Japan’s
population started to decline. Today, the volume of orders inside Japan can’t support
this many firms, while competition for projects abroad has grown fierce. In the past
two decades, highly competitive players in this sector have emerged in other
countries in Asia and elsewhere, causing the global market share held by Japanese
companies to decline.

After a big bang-like explosion a century ago, Japan’s power equipment space is
shrinking.


The collapse
In July 2001, Hitachi, Fuji Electric and Meidensha merged their power T&D businesses
to form Nihon AE Power Systems, with the following share structure: Hitachi 50%, Fuji
30%, and Meidensha 20%. This merger was an attempt to manage decreasing
domestic demand. A decade later, however, even this entity was dissolved.

In April 2002, just one year after the creation of Nihon AE Power, Toshiba and
Mitsubishi Electric also merged their assets in the same space to form TM T&D, an
equal partnership. That company, however, had an even shorter life, folding in March
2005.

Why were those power T&D mergers unsuccessful? In part, it was likely due to an
overt focus on the domestic market, which at the time still looked healthy if subdued.
Also, the combinations did little to bolster Japanese competitiveness overseas.

In the case of TM T&D, for example, the product lineup of the two parent companies
had a lot of overlap: both made transformers, switchgears, distribution equipment and
power systems. In such cases, engineers and sales teams from each side try to protect
their own tech and get embroiled in internal struggles. At the same time, what the

merger failed to do was offer a new leap in technology or improved business
efficiency.

Hitachi began to suspect that it needed to look for inspiration elsewhere and broke
away from Fuji and Meidensha.

Meanwhile, Japanese equipment makers looked to make gains through restructuring
in the power generation side of the business.

In October 2011, the hydro assets of Mitsubishi Electric, MHI and Hitachi merged to
form Hitachi Mitsubishi Hydro Corporation. (Hitachi with a 50% stake, Mitsubishi
Electric 30%, and MHI 20%). Hitachi supplies both water turbines and generators, MHI
supplies only water turbines and Mitsubishi Electric supplies generators.

Most suitable sites in Japan for large hydro power stations were already developed,
but this segment continued to bring in decent revenue from maintenance work. It was
a neat solution for a small segment, but all parties knew that the overall impact would
be small. So, industry players turned to big-ticket overseas M&A as their next
solution.

This precipitated the nadir for power equipment makers in Japan.


Nuclear fallout from investment
When nuclear energy came back in vogue around the mid-2000s thanks to a rethink
over new plant construction in the U.S. and elsewhere, as well as the emergence of
China as a major new investor in atomic stations, Toshiba decided to make a big bet
on the sector. After all, a nuclear power plant also contains a lot of equipment that’s
utilized in a thermal power plant. It seemed a logical next step.

Toshiba was already a major supplier of BWR reactors, one of the two dominant
technologies globally. But China and other new entrants to the nuclear arena seemed
more inclined to base their nuclear programs around PWR, the other mainstream tech.
And so, in 2006 Toshiba struck a $5.4 billion deal to buy Westinghouse.

Westinghouse, then owned by British Nuclear Fuels, had struggled for decades but
was on an upward trajectory having become one of the new foreign firms allowed to
win orders to build reactors in China. The prospect of entry to such a potentially large
market, and holding the keys to both PWR and BWR technologies, pushed Toshiba to
outbid GE and MHI and pay triple what Westinghouse was initially expected to cost.

Unfortunately for Toshiba, the deal spectacularly unraveled. The flood of Chinese
reactor orders never materialized as Beijing simply took over Westinghouse IP.
Construction projects in the U.S. stalled. Culture clashes between Toshiba and
Westinghouse foiled progress. Then came the news of accounting irregularities that
turned into billions of dollars in losses for Toshiba. Westinghouse finally filed for
bankruptcy in March 2017.

On a less grand scale, MHI saw its own nuclear ambitions sour. The company secured
an order for four reactors in Turkey and planned to partner with France’s Areva in the
project. Construction costs doubled, however, and MHI and Areva both pulled out in
2018. Since then, MHI has not secured any major nuclear orders for their traditional
PWR reactors.


The less “glamorous” path
At first, Hitachi fared just as poorly as its domestic industry peers. A post-Lehman
global slowdown hit the engineering group hard. In 2009, it posted a ¥787 billion
loss, the biggest by a Japanese manufacturer and the second biggest by a Japanese
company.

This led to hard choices. In nuclear, Hitachi decided to pool its business with GE,
becoming very much the junior partner in the global market (while retaining a stronger
presence in the domestic nuclear sector).

More significantly, Hitachi decided to refocus resources from generation to T&D, but

this time through international alliances. After years of searching for the right fit,
Hitachi made a record acquisition for a Swiss firm that makes high voltage DC (HVDC)
transmission infrastructure, transformers, and control systems. In 2018, Hitachi agreed
to pay $6.85 billion for about 80% of engineering conglomerate ABB’s power grid
business. In 2022, Hitachi exercised a $1.68 billion call option to buy out ABB’s 19.9%
stake in the joint venture, claiming full ownership of the entity, which has since been
renamed Hitachi Energy.

In the last five years, profit attributable to Hitachi’s shareholders is up 60%.

Reinventing themselves
Today, Japan’s power equipment makers are looking to reinvent themselves for the
net-zero era. Rounds of restructuring, resource consolidation and M&A have made the
companies more focused, although the ongoing troubles at Toshiba indicate that this
process is likely not over.

So, where are these companies heading? MHI has clearly aligned itself with the latest
nuclear renaissance and is the most likely vendor to build new reactors in Japan over
the coming two decades. After all, it has performed the lion’s share of maintenance
work on existing units nationwide in the last decade.

Meanwhile, MHI has poured more resources into development of hydrogen-fired
generation, promising commercial-scale turbines and other equipment ready to run
on ammonia or hydrogen fuel by 2025. It is also involved in several CCS test projects
in Japan and has orders for the technology from power plants around the world.
Perhaps even more telling is the fact that MHI has spun off its conventional thermal
power business.

| stake in the joint venture, claiming full ownership of the entity, which has since been |

| renamed Hitachi Energy. |

Hitachi poured its thermal power assets into a JV with MHI and then sold out; today, it
is more of a software-led engineering firm with interest in T&D, energy systems,
optimization, renewables and EV integration and carbon solutions. Hitachi is also
developing ammonia co-firing technologies.

The merger of assets by Mitsubishi Electric and MHI shrinks the product and service
options in pure thermal power even further. The two say they are interested in
transforming thermal plants to burn carbon-neutral fuels including hydrogen and
ammonia. That makes sense since Japan plans to decommission almost 27 GW of oil,
gas and coal-fired capacity this decade. While some new thermal stations will be
added, the net capacity loss should be around 17 GW, based on METI data.

In recent history, Japanese manufacturers have struggled to put aside former rivalries
and learn to survive together. Almost no one buys a Japanese branded smartphone
anymore. The makers of power equipment have taken hard decisions, scrapped once
untouchable assets and boldly selected new paths. Now they need their people to do
the same.

ENERGY       JOBS   IN  JAPAN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Column: Hiring the Wrong Person - Letting Employees Go in Japan

Regardless of the stringency of the interview process, the effectiveness of aptitude
tests and the quality of references from a candidate, it’s still possible to make the
wrong hire. There’s only so much that can be discerned through the interview, and
sometimes those who have the hard skills and track record simply don’t adjust into the
speed, style or culture of your business.

To make matters more complicated, Japan’s energy workforce is now facing a major
transition. This was traditionally a sector run by large corporations and utilities. But
over the last decade it has fragmented into a number of smaller domestic and
international players. Many highly-qualified professionals have spent their entire
career in one company, which makes gathering reference checks troublesome and
poses challenges for people to adjust to a new corporate culture and way of working
mid-career.

What’s more, letting people go in Japan is no easy feat. So here are the key points to
keep in mind before and after things come to such a conclusion.


Letting go of an employee in Japan
Japanese labor law is highly protective of employees, making it more difficult to fire
them in comparison to the U.S. and other markets. All employment contracts are
superseded by Japanese Labour Law, which can effectively mute clauses in the
contract. A key example of this is probation periods. Typically, we see a three- or six-
month probation period in a full-time contract; however, under law, once an
employee has been employed for a period of two weeks, they are protected by labor
law, and the contract cannot be instantly terminated as is often stipulated.

In order to let an employee go over poor performance or discipline violations, the
matter must be clearly proven. While cases of severe misconduct can warrant instant
dismissal, when it comes to minor infractions or underperformance, employers must
move slowly and carefully. This includes meetings, warnings, and support from the
company to help the employee improve over a period of months.

In both cases, the employer is required to give 30 days’ notice and pay the employee
during that time. Like many things in Japan, details on how long, and what level of
warnings must be given are vague. For a more comprehensive overview, we suggest
speaking to a labor lawyer before taking decisive action, since the majority of unfair
dismissal lawsuits go the way of the employee.

A negotiated voluntary resignation is the most common and effective method to
release an employee in Japan. In this case, the employer will need to privately speak
with the employee, explain the reasons for which they wish to end the employment,
and compensate the employee for their voluntary resignation. This will come with
costs: months of salary, accrued bonuses, buyout of annual leave, and etc.

Contract labor force
For construction and engineering, Japan has a relatively mature contract labor market
that can readily move around the country for work on project sites. However, the
contract employment market for highly skilled workers in finance, law, project
management, and etc., is very narrow. This is in large part due to a cultural adversity
to perceived risk and instability. In addition to cultural or social pressure, it can be
more difficult for contract employees to get access to financing for home loans,
approvals for rental properties, entrance for children to schools of choice, and etc.

There’s some opportunity to hire talent in more white collar, headquarter functions.
However, this tends to be for either top level professionals who come with a high
price tag, or well-connected experts who are close to or beyond standard retirement
age.


Severance payments
Again, Japanese labor law tends to be quite vague when it comes to how much
should be paid to workers during layoffs in cases of downsizing, market exit or
strategic shifts in the business.

While we’ve seen cases of companies paying out severance as low as the legally
required 30 days, this is on the low side and tends to anger and disappoint
employees. Though a company is unlikely to face legal action for this, be careful,
because the industry is small. People talk to each other. So, in order to protect your
brand and corporate reputation, we advise against paying such a low amount,
especially if you plan to remain in Japan’s market.

On average, the market standard is a package of between three to six months,
depending on the employee’s position, length of service and contribution. Also, just
like with letting an employee go over poor performance, resolving this matter via a
negotiated voluntary resignation is the most painless option.

If the employer is downsizing for economic reasons, a key point to bear in mind is that
you’ll need to prove that other cost reduction measures have already been
implemented. These may be reducing working hours, cutting executive pay, business
trips, and etc.


Risk mitigation strategy
As mentioned earlier, probation periods are rendered mute as labor laws protect
employees two weeks after starting. An option available to employers is to offer a
three- or six-month fixed contract, with the option to move to full-time employment
upon successful performance during the contract period. In this case, there’s no
obligation to renew, or offer full-time employment, effectively giving an option to
cease employment after expiry of the initial contract.

Point to bear in mind, though: Japanese are typically risk-averse, and this strategy is
still not widely used, meaning that if a company is making an offer to a candidate with
multiple offers, this may reduce the chances of a successful close. Also, we advise to
clearly state, in written form at the time of offering the initial contract, the full-time
employment conditions, including salary, bonuses, annual leave, benefits, etc.

Case study A:
Private equity backed infrastructure developer | All positions

One of our early clients has been employing this strategy with all hires. Initially,
people are employed on a six-month contract, with full insurance and medical
benefits. The offer letter clearly states the conditions for full-time employment so
that the employee knows what to expect. This company is not concerned about
the risk of losing some candidates who are not keen on an initial contract without
guarantee of full-time employment. Their position is that they’re fostering a
performance-based, results-focused culture, and a lean, high-performing team.
Therefore, they wish to attract only those with confidence in their ability to
deliver.

Case study B:
Private equity solar and storage project developer | Country Manager & Head of
Development

Some years ago, we supported a new firm to enter the Japanese renewable
energy market when it needed to hire an initial senior leadership team. The
company wished to hire professionals who were well connected and could add
value very quickly. The hires were initially given a three-month contract with a
reasonable monthly salary and performance targets to hit before being
considered for full-time employment.

This narrowed the candidate pool, as only those who could deliver quickly and
had a high-risk appetite, were eligible. An interesting twist was the power placed
in the candidate’s hands. By performing well and bringing projects forward to
acquire and develop within that three-month period, candidates were able to
make a case for themselves and greatly increase their bargaining power for
package negotiations when it came time to raise the issue of full-time
employment.

We see this strategy most often implemented with project developers and
private equity investors. This can be an excellent risk mitigation tool for
professionals who are in highly ‘pay for performance’ positions, such as
development and acquisition. However, in more stable functions it can be harder
to attract talent.


Ultimately, Japan is a market that best rewards a long-term view. The same is true in
the hiring and firing part of it. However, starting a new office or building from a small
team gives you the ability to set the tone and mold a culture in line with your business
targets.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI AND FILIPPO PEDRETTI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Energy transition
Resolving congestion on the main electricity grid was top of the agenda at the first
meeting of federal, state and territory energy ministers in 2023. The gathering
approved changes to reduce lost electricity and lower the risks for clean energy
investors. The government also plans to push for a separate national green hydrogen
strategy.

China/ Commodities trading
A subsidiary of CNIC Corp bought an approximate 5% stake, worth about $220
million, in Swiss-based global energy trader Mercuria. China seeks to hedge its global
interests against possible Western sanctions due to its support for Russia in its conflict
with NATO.

EU/Gas supplies
While Europe had a mild winter with gas storage close to record levels, it faces
another costly race to replenish reserves. While prices have eased to around €50/
MWh from last August's peak of more than €340, they still remain above historic
averages.

France/ Climate lawsuit
Three climate activist groups took legal action in a Paris court against BNP Paribas,
alleging that the bank's loans to big oil and gas companies breach laws that protect
the environment.

Indonesia/ Carbon trading
Indonesia launched the first phase of mandatory carbon trading for coal power plants.
The first stage of a carbon trading mechanism will cover 99 power plants with a total
installed capacity of 33.6 GW. Coal makes up more than half of Indonesia's power
generation.

Methane emissions
The fossil fuel industry is failing to tackle methane emissions despite pledges to fix
leaking infrastructure, said the International Energy Agency (IEA). In 2022, the global
energy industry released into the atmosphere some 135 million tons of methane.

Sri Lanka/ Wind power
The Board of Investment approved two wind power plants by India's Adani Green
Energy with a total investment of $442 million. The two wind farms will have a total
capacity of 350 MW and will be operational by 2025.
Vietnam/ Wind power
EU manufacturers might make major investments to build wind turbine plants. The

Southeast Asian country is seen as a potential major player because it has strong
winds in shallow waters near densely populated coastal areas, reported the World
Bank.

UK/ Energy subsidies
The UK government announced measures to help more than 300 energy-intensive
companies which are dealing with high power costs. The targeted manufacturing
sectors include steel, metal, paper, and chemicals.

Pakistan/ Coal power
Pakistan intends to quadruple its coal-fired power from 2.31 GW to 10 GW after
deciding not to build new gas-fired plants. The country experienced severe blackouts
after not being able to procure required volumes of gas or LNG last year. Pakistan
needs to cut electricity costs and is facing a severe foreign exchange crisis.

EU/ Carbon market
Europe's carbon price hit an all time high of €100 ($106.59) as its economy starts to
recover. Demand for carbon contracts is increasing as many anticipate that industrial
companies will restart production. At the same time, the prospect of tighter climate
regulations means that pollution rights may be less available in the future.
