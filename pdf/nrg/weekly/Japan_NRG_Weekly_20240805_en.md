NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Kishida to propose a decarbonization framework for Central Asia during summit

(NHK, Aug 1)
•  PM Kishida will propose a collaboration framework to speed up decarbonization in Central Asia.
No concrete details have been given so far.
•  He will join the summit of five Central Asian nations to be held in Kazakhstan in mid-August.
•  The summit will discuss a wide range of areas, such as the spread of green technologies,
infrastructure development to improve regional connectivity, human resource growth in the fields
of IT and governance, and the expansion of trade in agricultural goods.

•  CONTEXT: Kazakhstan is among the world’s top uranium miners, as well as a producer of nickel,
chromite ore, tungsten, rare earths, etc. The Japan-Kazakhstan Treaty on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear
Energy took effect in 2011. The following year, state-owned Kazatomprom and Sumitomo Corp set
up a JV for rare earths production.
• TAKEAWAY: Maintaining close ties with Central Asian states, notably Kazakhstan, is important not only for
expanding political influence in the former Soviet states, but also for stronger clean energy supply chains.
Since Kazakhstan is landlocked, cargoes are usually transported through China to reach Japan, and this limits

bilateral trade potential.




Govt to place export controls on recycled battery metals
(Nikkei, Aug 2)
•  The govt plans to amend the Effective Resource Use Promotion Act in 2025 requiring storage

battery manufacturers to reuse scrap metals generated during production.
•  METI plans to ask manufacturers such as Panasonic and GS Yuasa to report on recycling goals and
progress, and to penalize companies not following their plans. The ministry aims to broaden the
scope of this regulation to metals recovered from end-of-life storage batteries and their
components.
•  CONTEXT: When a battery is recycled, it is shredded and its base metals separated. Valuable
metals that make up key parts of the battery, such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, are known as ‘black

mass’.
•  To date, recycled battery materials known as “black mass” have been exported and hardly re-used
domestically.
•  CONTEXT: The Basel Convention that limits the cross-border flows of lead batteries was effective
in keeping such supplies in Japan. However, the Convention lacks clarity on ‘black mass’ and other
e-wastes, resulting in governments implementing diverse regulations, including export controls in
the name of a circular economy.

• TAKEAWAY: In the past, the govt has considered export controls on industrial raw materials, including used
aluminum beverage cans used for car parts, not just rare metals. Requests for export tariffs, approval systems,

4

etc, were made to the govt but they were not implemented as they might violate WTO rules. Instead, changes
were made in the customs coding system to monitor the material flows.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

UACJ, Kyoto Univ produce high purity aluminum from scrap
(Nikkei, Aug 1)
o  UACJ and Kyoto University have developed a liquid solution to reproduce end-of-life
aluminum products into aluminum with minimum 99.9% purity.
o  UACJ and Nippon Light Metal plan to commercialize the 99.9% recycling in the 2030s.

The recycled metal could be used in aerospace and electronics.
o  CONTEXT: Japan imports 2 million tons/ year of primary aluminum products made from
bauxite minerals. Beverage cans and other products are recycled into secondary alloys
that usually contain up to 90% aluminum. The carbon footprint of secondary aluminum is
less than 10% of that of primary aluminum.
• TAKEAWAY: In theory, expanding the use of domestic aluminum scrap reduces dependence on imports and
strengthens supply chains. However, 99.9% purity is too low to be called primary-equivalent. Japanese

consumers use 99.98% purity, which is above the global market standard of 99.97%. Aluminum purity is not
important; more important is reducing certain impurities (iron, silicon, etc) to the minimum. In short, the UACJ-
Nippon Light Metal collaboration may result in innovative alloys for specialized applications, but their products
will unlikely replace primary aluminum imports.




PM Kishida holds first ministerial meeting on circular economy

(Government statement, July 30)
•  PM Kishida held the first ministerial meeting to promote the circular economy by:
o  Launching schemes to recycle solar panels, car components and manufactured products,
o  Reducing food loss,
o  Developing local production-consumption business models, etc.
•  From August, he will hold community meetings nationwide, with a focus on the youth. New
policies will be written by the end of the calendar year.

•  CONTEXT: Recycling end-of-life cars is almost 100% for gasoline and hybrid cars. Automakers
have integrated recycling into their supply chains on a voluntary basis by positioning resource
recycling as a business. The ministerial meeting aims for stronger guidelines, possibly legally
binding, to push recycling in other sectors.




MoE seeks feedback for revising green bond guidelines
(Government statement, Aug 2)
•  The MoE seeks public feedback on its proposal to revise green corporate bond issuance
guidelines, so that it reflects guidance from the Loan Market Association and the International

Capital Markets Association on key performance indicators, etc.
•  Feedback submission closes on Aug 20.

JCLP proposes 2035 national energy goals
(JCLP statement, July 30)
•  Japan Climate Leaders Partnership, a lobby group consisting of 244 companies, has made policy
proposals to METI and the MoE that include:
o  To set a 2035 goal of 75% emission cuts from 2013 levels;

o  To increase renewables’ share in the power mix to over 60% by 2035;
o  To open policy making to renewable energy consumers, notably those running global
business operations, since presently govt panels are dominated by academics and
consultancies;
o  To boost the current 74 GW renewables capacity in Japan (69 GW solar; 4.5 GW wind) to
268 GW by 2035 (194 GW solar; 30 GW onshore wind; 44 GW offshore wind).

• TAKEAWAY: The JLCP proposal is clear on its support for renewables. But beyond arguing against anything
that “locks in fossil fuels”, it doesn’t clarify its stance on other GX pathways being pursued by the Japan govt,
such as coal-ammonia co-firing, LNG-hydrogen co-firing and CCS. It also did not provide comments on the
long-term decarbonized power source auction system.




KHI, Kajima Corp join on DAC and carbon-negative concrete research

(Company statement, July 26)
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) and Kajima Corp will conduct joint research about how to combine
Kawasaki's Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology with Kajima's CO2-SUICOM carbon-negative
concrete.
•  Kawasaki's DAC captures CO2 directly from the air using a solid adsorbent made of a porous
material and an amine compound.
•  Kajima's CO2-SUICOM absorbs CO2 during concrete production to achieve net-zero CO2

emissions.
•  The collaboration aims to integrate DAC into precast concrete plants.




MHI and QST complete OVT prototype for ITER
(Company statement, July 31)
•  MHI and the
National Institutes
for Quantum

Science and
Technology (QST)

•  The OVT is essential for the divertor, which manages heat and impurities in the reactor's plasma.
The prototype is ready for production.
•  MHI and QST will make six OVT units by FY2025.
•  CONTEXT: ITER brings together 35 nations to build the world's largest tokamak, a magnetic fusion
device designed to prove the feasibility of fusion as a large-scale and carbon-free source of energy

based on the same principle that powers the stars.



EneCoat perovskite module hits 20% power efficiency

(Japan NRG, Aug 2)
•  EneCoat Technologies has achieved a power efficiency of over 20% for its perovskite solar module
sized 7.5 cm by 7.5 cm, a performance which nearly equals that of silicon solar modules at 20-30%.
•  The company plans to achieve similar power efficiencies for modules of larger sizes.
•  CONTEXT: Sharp holds the world record for the highest solar power generation efficiency of
33.7% outside laboratories.




IHI, Taiwan Fertilizer ink clean ammonia MoU

(Company statement, July 30)
•  IHI and Taiwan Fertilizer, the largest ammonia producer in Taiwan, inked an MoU on building a
global value chain of clean ammonia.
•  The companies will study supplying the fuel in Japan, Taiwan and elsewhere in East Asia, while
exploring production sites globally.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
NYK, TBG obtain AiP for ship-to-ship ammonia supply system

(Company statement, July 31)

ENECHANGE  appoints new head following CEO’s retirement
(Company statement, July 29)
•  ENECHANGE announced Hirata Masayoshi as its new head; he assumed the position of Chairman

of the Board of Directors on July 30.
•  Hirata replaced Kiguchi Yohei, the firm’s founder and CEO who stepped down.
•  The company said Hirata was chosen based on previous management experience.
•  Hirata is a former executive at Toshiba, who was responsible for restoring management after the
company's accounting fraud was uncovered in 2015.
•  CONTEXT: Kiguchi’s resignation comes in response to problems in accounting uncovered in March
after which the former CEO took responsibility for the mishandling. ENECHANGE also decided to

decentralize the authority of top management and appoint a full-time head of the internal audit
office to improve corporate governance. Kiguchi was accused of making an opaque indirect
investment in a special purpose company for EV charging facilities. An external investigation
committee's report in June revealed problems with internal controls at the firm. Kiguchi tendered
his resignation at the board of directors meeting on March 29.




J-POWER takes stake in SIRC, will develop device measurement meters

Aomori Gov gives permission for operation of interim nuclear fuel storage facility

(Nikkei, July 29)
•  The Aomori Governor will support operation of Japan's first interim storage facility for spent
nuclear fuel in Mutsu city.
•  In August the prefecture will sign a "safety agreement" with operators and Mutsu city.
•  Governor Miyashita said he received assurances on the eventual further removal of the spent fuel
to a permanent site. Mutsu’s mayor also supports the agreement.
•  On July 23, Miyashita met with METI minister Saito who indicated potential further removal sites,

including the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.
•  The interim storage facility in Aomori will be operated by Recyclable-Fuel Storage Co (RFS) that’s
funded by TEPCO and Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. It will temporarily store spent fuel until sent
elsewhere to be reprocessed.
•  The facility plans to start operations in September. It will first receive spent fuel from TEPCO's
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP.
•  CONTEXT: In 2004, TEPCO requested cooperation from local authorities, and in 2005, Aomori

Pref agreed to its construction. Following prolonged safety reviews, the facility will begin accepting
spent fuel.
• TAKEAWAY: Delays in completing the Rokkasho plant still raise concerns in Aomori. While Mutsu's interim
storage facility will be operational, there’s no ironclad guarantee of permanent storage somewhere else. The
capacity for storing spent fuel at NPPs is nearing their limits, with about 80% of storage capacity nationwide
already utilized. Japan's nuclear fuel cycle plan aims to reprocess spent fuel, but the repeated delays in the

reprocessing plant's completion raise doubts about the plan's feasibility.




TOCOM  sets up expert panel for ‘hedge accounting’
(Denki Shimbun, Aug 1)
•  Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) set up an expert panel to address issues related to the
application of "hedge accounting" for electricity futures.
•  This type of accounting aligns financial transactions to reduce risk.

•  However, it’s difficult to apply under Japanese accounting standards, and thus discourages
electricity companies from engaging in futures trading. The panel aims to identify practical
challenges and consider lobbying the relevant institutions.

Kyushu Electric announces drop in electricity bill for Sept

(Company statement, July 30)
o  Kyushu Electric announced that the average September electricity bill for a standard
household (250 kWh usage) will be ¥6,556. This is ¥997 less than for August.
o  Kyushu Electric's standard rates include a ¥1,000 govt subsidy.
o  CONTEXT: This decrease is the first in 15 months, and is due to the govt’s temporary
reinstatement of subsidies for three months to ameliorate the impact of rising prices.



Govt launches panel on environmental impact of offshore wind farms
(Government statement, July 30)
•  METI, the MoE, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism launched a 11-
member study group to establish a methodology to measure the environmental impact of offshore
wind farms.
•  The study group will identify possible causes and how to measure impact during construction and

after the turbines begin operation, such as noise from building work and how marine life is
affected.
•  The studies will be completed by March 2025.




KEPCO plans 360 MW offshore wind farm in Hokkaido
(Company statement, July 31)
•  KEPCO plans to develop an offshore wind farm off the coast of Matsumae Town in Hokkaido with a
capacity of up to 360 MW.
•  The firm filed an environmental impact assessment consideration.

•  The govt designated the area off Matsumae coast as a "promising area."
•  The project covers 3,354 hectares, and will accommodate between 15 and 25 wind turbines, (each
14 MW to 22.6 MW capacity).
•  CONTEXT: In the surrounding area, several companies are considering offshore wind power
development off Hiyama, north of Matsumae. Both Hiyama and Matsumae were among the five
newly designated ‘promising zones’ last year, alongside Ishikari, Ganu-Minamishiribeshi and

Shimamaki in Hokkaido.

Sumitomo, JGC plans mass-production for floating wind supply chain
(Company statement, July 31)
•  Sumitomo and JGC Japan, a domestic EPC operating company of JGC Holdings, inked a deal to
mass-produce and create a supply chain of components for floating offshore wind systems.
•  The firms will collaborate in:

o  Detailed design of components;
o  Partnering with steel and shipbuilding manufacturers to manufacture components;
o  Transportation of components to base ports for offshore wind power generation.
•  The firms will form an association with 20 manufacturers in relevant fields, aiming to establish a
system to produce around 100 floating wind turbines per year by 2030.
•  CONTEXT: Sumitomo is a lead member in a consortium for a power generation project off the

coast of Enoshima Island in Saikai, Nagasaki Pref, and is in discussions with Oshima Shipbuilding, a
member of the Sumitomo Group, with a view to utilizing its large-scale shipbuilding facilities and
mass production tech in production of floating structures.
• TAKEAWAY: This new association shows strong commitment from both local manufacturers and the govt to
help the sector expand in Japan and abroad; the mass produced platforms will be shipped first to Europe.
With a few pilot projects underway, Japan seeks to take the lead in floating wind power, and at this pace may
become successful in reaching technological proficiency, since there are no commercial-scale floating wind

farms operating anywhere.

Chugoku Electric applies for long-term management plan for Shimane Unit 2
(Company statement, July 30)
•  Chugoku Electric applied for NRA approval of its long-term facility management plan for Shimane
NPP Unit 2. This follows the recent amendments to the Reactor Regulation Act.
•  The amended law takes effect on June 6, 2025, and mandates that NPP operators secure approval

for continued operations beyond 30 years. A long-term plan must be approved by June 5, 2025,
and must include measures to ensure safe management of essential equipment and structures.
•  CONTEXT: On April 24, the NRA approved changes to the safety regulations for Shimane Unit 2
based. The long-term management plan builds on this. It specifies measures for degradation
management, such as monitoring temperature and pressure changes. It requires testing for
neutron irradiation embrittlement, and replacing pipes when necessary.




Hokkaido Electric to change plan for spent nuclear fuel-carrying ships at Tomari NPP

(Nikkei, Aug 1)
•  Hokkaido Electric said it won’t allow ships carrying spent nuclear fuel to enter the port on the
premises of Tomari NPP.
•  The utility is considering building a new port outside the NPP premises, or using an existing nearby
port.
•  Hokkaido Electric is considering measures to prevent moored ships from drifting in the event of a
tsunami.

•  Hokkaido Electric now plans to dock ships at a port some distance away from Tomari NPP to avoid
damage to the plant.
•  If a port outside the NPP premises is used, then land transport will be needed for the nuclear fuel
to reach the plant.




NRA to declare Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 non-compliant with new safety standard
(Nikkei, Aug 2)
•  The NRA accepted its review team's conclusion that Japan Atomic Power Company's Tsuruga NPP
Unit 2 does not meet new regulatory standards. This is due to the potential existence of an active

fault beneath the reactor.
•  The NRA will now draft an evaluation that deems the plant "non-compliant."
•  CONTEXT: Under new rules set after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, reactors can’t restart if
there is an active fault underneath. JAPC proposed further investigation, but the NRA found it
lacking and unclear. This marks the first time since 2012 that a reactor has been denied restart
approval. It will force JAPC to consider decommissioning Tsuruga Unit 2.

reduction in their reporting.
•  "TEPCO Carbon Offset Gas" will be sold to corporate customers and will likely be about 10%
more expensive than regular gas.
•  Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas also sell city gas paired with environmental certificates. Actual
reductions in CO2 emissions are expected after 2030 when alternative fuels such as hydrogen and

synthetic methane are expected to become available.
•  CONTEXT: Environmental certificates are an interim option to show reduced CO2 emissions, with
strong demand in manufacturing sectors. Japan consumes about 40 billion m3 of city gas, with
around 60% used industrially. CO2 emissions from industrial gas usage account for 10-20% of the
sector's total emissions.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Saibu Gas announces city gas bill for Sept

(Company statement, July 30)
•  Saibu Gas said that the average city September gas bill for a standard household (23 m3 usage)
will be ¥6,201. This is ¥423 cheaper due to state subsidies.
•  This is the second consecutive month of decline.




Number of petrol stations continues to decline
(Nikkei, July 29)
•  Japan's petrol stations count decreased 2% in FY2023, with the total number falling to 27,414. The

govt offered subsidies to keep gasoline prices low. Yet, demand remains weak, leading to closures
and business shifts.
•  The drop is attributed to slumping oil demand due to decarbonization.
•  Another factor is population decrease.




LNG stocks down 2.3% from last week, up almost 11% YoY
(Government data, July 31)
•  LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 2.15 million tons as of July 28, down 2.3% from the previous
week (2.35 million tons). This is 10.8% up from end July 2023 (1.94 million tons), but 1.8% down

from the past 5-year average of 2.19 million tons.

•  CONTEXT: The weather is now more tropical with squalls in the evening. JMA alerts mention
thunderstorms and small tornadoes. LNG stock levels have been up and down recently – within
10% of 2 million tons – but sufficient to cope with the hot summer.

Japan Seeks Data Validation to Show Liquified Hydrogen Has Strong Future

Japan is an obvious leader in liquified hydrogen, which is one of several ways that
hydrogen can be transported and stored. But while it has invested significant money
and engineering hours into this energy solution, it’s still unclear whether this approach
will catch on.

At a time when Japan seeks to become a major player in this clean-burning fuel, the
issue of what is the optimal means to transport hydrogen is crucial. Investing heavily in
infrastructure around one solution, only to see another approach win mass adoption,
would end up wasting large state funds and damage Japan’s goal of acting as a
regional energy transition leader.

Meanwhile, other hydrogen carrier options are progressing in terms of supply chain
development and technological breakthroughs. Hydrogen can also be converted into
ammonia, which has become the go-to solution among Japanese power utilities; it
can be carried via methanol (the fuel of choice for some major shipping firms in
Europe); or bonded into compounds such as methylcyclohexane (MCH).

Still, backers of the liquified hydrogen solution are not giving up. Building on the
successful 2021 launch of the oceangoing liquefied hydrogen bulk vessel, Suiso
Frontier, the companies behind this technology in Japan promise to offer commercial-
scale equipment for their supply chain within this decade. They also claim that they
are well positioned to hit 2030 government cost targets and that in some ways
liquified hydrogen is safer than ammonia and MCH, which are classified as dangerous
chemicals.

Recently, the promoters of the liquified hydrogen technologies in Japan delivered a
report to the government on their progress. These discussions are inconclusive but
Korean and European shipping sectors are taking similar steps to to propose
international standards and rules for liquefied hydrogen.

Japan’s IMO ambition
Each hydrogen carrier option has its pros and cons. With liquefied hydrogen, the risks
include a chance that it ignites. If temperatures rise above -253 C and the pressure
changes, then the liquid evaporates into gas and may become explosive. This, some
critics argue, potentially makes it more risky to transport over long distances,
compared with ammonia or MCH.

The inconclusive nature of debates around various technological solutions can only be
solved with practical evidence. Which is why, a lot of Japanese efforts today are
focused on collecting data on liquified hydrogen solutions to prove their viability.

The Japanese government also wants to take such data to global institutions in order
to have a role in formulating international standards around hydrogen transport and
usage. Japan is especially keen to lead the hydrogen rulemaking discussions within
the International Maritime Organization. That entity sets rules for the International

Code of the Construction and Equipment of Ships (IGC). This code is applied to all
forms of ocean gas transport of all IMO members.

Data collection for the IGC discussions is a part of the national project called the
Large-Scale Hydrogen Supply Chain Establishment that’s funded by the state-run
Green Innovation Fund. The project began in July 2023 and will be completed in
March 2025.

A consortium called the CO2-free Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain Technology
Research Association (Hystra), consisting of the Suiso Frontier’s builder Kawasaki
Heavy Industries, hydrogen producer Iwatani Corporation, and the operator of the
vessel, Shell group, is gathering the data.



















Suiso Frontier is no ordinary bulk vessel — it has proprietary features to keep the tank
temperatures at -253 C throughout the sail. KHI had previously developed liquefied
hydrogen-propelled rocket systems that had applications for Suiso Frontier. It
designed a double-shelled tank with a vacuum between the two shells to insulate
heat. Glass fiber reinforced plastics, laminated heat insulators and thermal protection
panels were also used to insulate heat and radiation.

On July 18, Hystra reported its initial results at the New Energy and Industrial
Technology Development (NEDO) event in Yokohama. The report focused on:
The boil off gas rate, or the pace of liquid evaporating into gas, during transport;
The impact of temperature changes on the exhaust vent safety system;
Continuous operation of onshore loading arms to offload cargo.
During the period under review, which was from July 2023 to June 2024, Suiso
Frontier made a round trip to and from Australia: First, it sailed 19,000 kilometers of
the Singapore-Hastings-Kobe route with its tank empty, and from April 11 to May 17
that distance was 17,000 km from Sydney to Kobe with the tank filled with 75 tons of
liquefied hydrogen.

Hystra reported that the boil-off gas rate, or the pace of liquid evaporating, was 0.3%
per day, meaning 75 tons becomes 70 tons after 20 days. That’s higher than about
0.028% per day for LNG. It also said the chemical composition of the cargo did not
change during the 17,000 km journey. However, Hystra didn’t say if the changes in the
cargo volume impacted the storage conditions in any way, or if there was no change
at all.

An exhaust vent system, which is a safety mechanism to release hydrogen into the
atmosphere in emergencies, was tested for the first time. There were two tests: the
warm vent test with temperatures of -35 C, and cold vent test at -109 C. In both cases,
only hydrogen was released and did not cause environmental damage, Hystra said. It
did not provide data on the amount of the gas release, but asserted that the tests
verified liquefied hydrogen was safer compared to ammonia or MCH.

Continuous liquefied hydrogen loading tests were conducted using proprietary
hydrogen loading arms (LAS). Loading was performed six consecutive times. The tank
temperatures were changed from -253 C to -50 C, creating deliberate stress. The
equipment safety features did not change.

Hystra said the tests verified the high safety levels of Suiso Frontier’s equipment.
Furthermore, this year it will conduct more tests that include:
•  Changing the pressure conditions inside the tank during loading
•  Testing equipment tolerance to long haul travels
•  Measuring impact of equipment exposure to both liquefied hydrogen and
hydrogen gas as heat stress is applied to the molecules
•  Continuous LAS loading operations


The tests will be completed in March 2025. The Japanese government will provide the
Hystra data and a preliminary standard proposal to the Sub-Committee on Carriage of
Cargoes and Containers (CCC) meeting of the IMO later in 2025.

After 2025, Hystra will continue testing with a larger vessel than the Suiso Frontier,
which has only a 75-ton transport capacity and is too small for commercial operations.
Data obtained from the larger vessel tests will be provided to the IMO and hopefully,
new standards will be written by 2030.

Industry wary of high costs
Industry insiders have expressed mixed feelings about the advances in liquefied
hydrogen. On July 25, Japan Suiso Energy, the KHI-Iwatani venture, said it will
construct a liquefied hydrogen import terminal in the Kawasaki waterfront area that
includes an offloading terminal and a 50,000 m3-sized tank.

The facilities will be built by FY2028, and will be running on a commercial basis in
FY2030. Some hydrogen backers are excited, but others are wary of the high capital
costs of building onshore and offshore facilities; not to mention the ships. The skeptics
say that the amount of effort that’s being put into creating suitable equipment for
liquid hydrogen transport and data gathering to make global standards does not
correspond to the business opportunities in this technology.

“We could have the best technologies and be the ones [who take the lead in] writing
the international standards, but no one will care, because liquefied hydrogen is just
too expensive. We won’t get any new business” from all this effort, said a concerned
official from a gas inspection system manufacturer. His company has decided to focus
on sustainable aviation fuel instead.

Liquefied hydrogen is far from a mature technology. Hydrogen is highly permeable,
meaning it leaks easily from joints and tanks, ignites easily and cannot be noticed by

20

human eyes when burning. It could explode and destroy its storage tanks when
pressures change. For sure, such risks could be mitigated by developing new
technologies, but this additional R&D will raise costs further.

In order to improve the safety standards, special heat insulating materials and
components might be needed – and in large quantities. This not only increases costs,
but makes it more challenging to make sure there is sufficient amount of special
materials available to build the large tanks and ships of the liquid hydrogen supply
chain.

This challenge has not gone unnoticed by those working on liquid hydrogen
equipment.

Toyo Kanetsu, a tank manufacturer that spoke at the NEDO event, said it was
planning to build a 5,000 m3-sized liquefied hydrogen tank on a trial basis. “The
biggest challenge in scaling up the tank size to 50,000 m3 is sourcing raw material
supplies… it will be difficult to collect materials for a 50,000 m3 tank,” said a Toyo
Kanetsu official.

With widespread use of liquid hydrogen in Japan, there’ll also be a need to build
ships that distribute the fuel around the country. Current tests and calculations show
that carrying thousands of tons of the molecules on trolley trucks is inefficient.

Despite the challenges, Japan Suiso Energy told Japan NRG that by 2030 it aims to
clear the ¥30/ NN3 hydrogen cost target set by the government, which means today’s
much higher costs will be reduced. Liquefied hydrogen projects, ranging from data
gathering to facility developments, get funded by the government through the Green
Innovation Fund and other grants.


Ally and competition in the neighborhood
While many of those involved in the hydrogen sector say they have lukewarm
expectations for the development of a commercial scale liquid hydrogen supply chain,
Japan has some support in this field in neighboring South Korea.

In June, Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, Samsung Heavy Industries,
Hanwha Ocean, POSCO, Hyundai Steel, and the Korean Register signed a MoU to
standardize testing methods of materials used for liquefied hydrogen ship tanks.

HD Hyundai group is also working with Japan’s Mitsui OSK Lines to develop a
liquefied hydrogen carrier to be commercially available by 2030. And, they plan to
work with the American Bureau of Shipping to write draft standards. These alliances
could possibly support the push for liquefied hydrogen but they could be competitors
to the KHI-Iwatani-Japan Suiso Energy alliance.

With so many resources, financial and engineering, invested in promoting liquefied
hydrogen as a viable commercial product, Japan may feel that it simply cannot back
down now. Whether backers of this form of hydrogen manage to convince consumers
to take the plunge on their vision remains to be seen.

Energy Jobs in Japan: Reading Between the Lines with Japanese Candidates

As new opportunities and technologies appear in Japan’s energy landscape, the
number of overseas companies entering the market has been steadily increasing.
Japan’s External Trade Organisation (JETRO) has noted energy-related firms as
among the top three industries of new market entrants over the past year.

Often, this is a foreign company’s first foray into the Japanese market. Many of these
have previously supported Japanese clients in their overseas projects, or provided
products and services from a regional base. However, they have not had a reason to
attract and recruit local talent in Japan. And when the need to make such hires finally
arises, a number of cultural clashes and misunderstandings tend to pop up.

Let’s take a look at the nuances of communication in an employment interview – when
a foreign firm is looking for a Japanese hire – that commonly cause
misunderstandings, badly managed expectations and ultimately suboptimal outcomes
for hiring companies; and how these can best be avoided.


Very high context communication culture
Erin Meyer’s book, The Culture Map, provides a deep dive into low context and high
context communication cultures. The U.S., UK and Australia rank as the lowest context
communication cultures globally, whereas Japan is on the opposite side of the
spectrum.


In a practical sense, Americans mean what they say and nothing more. You can
decipher their message simply by understanding the words communicated.
Furthermore, repetition is common in low context cultures. An American will likely
start their point by outlining what they will say, then saying it and finally summarizing
what they said to make sure it is clearly understood.

The Japanese on the other hand tend to communicate on multiple levels below
verbalized words. Vocal tone, body language, posture, time taken to reply, word
choice and the choice to not say certain words or verbalize a particular point need to
be observed when communicating.

In the U.S., the phrase “I can see your point of view” would likely be read as “now I
understand and we agree.” In Japan, however, this may be a polite way of saying “I
disagree completely, but you have your opinion and I don’t feel like confronting you
on this topic.”

This first misread, whether it’s the Japanese failing to express a point clearly, or the
American being unable to read the air of communication, can set the tone for the rest
of the interview to become increasingly distant and disconnected.

The Japanese are able to communicate with each other in a high context manner,
partially due to the fact that it’s an island nation that was closed off for centuries.

22

Though there are certainly differences between regions, the Japanese have a good
amount of shared experiences growing up that allow for a mutual understanding with
less verbal input.

Conversely, in a younger, larger nation with a significantly more multicultural
population such as the U.S., the amount of shared experiences in childhood is far less.
The result is a culture where people explain their point of view very clearly to ensure
proper understanding, whereas the Japanese can implicitly understand each other. In
fact, Japanese has a popular word ‘KY, or kuuki yomenai’ that translates as ‘person
who cannot read the air’, which is used to describe those who fail to pick up implicitly
communicated messages.

When interviewing a Japanese professional, pay attention to the details and nuances.
In a case where you aren’t 100% sure of their intent in what they say, don’t be afraid
to pause, take a step back and clarify the point, before moving on to the next topic.

Modesty is elegant, we succeed together
As a 14-year resident of Japan, one common difference of perception I often have
with foreign interviewers is the self-confidence of a Japanese candidate. Another
Japanese word that’s important in understanding the national character is ‘kenkyou’
which most closely translates as ‘modesty’. However, it has a higher context that
includes respectfulness, appreciation and gratitude. To be kenkyou is to be
sophisticated, well educated, knowing one’s place in society.

In the context of a job interview, it is clear that the candidate in almost all cases will
see themselves as the junior party, therefore requiring an attitude of kenkyou. Their
body language, word choice, way of expressing achievements will be modest and
downplaying their achievements, while showing respect and appreciation to the
support of others in the achievement of their goals.


For more context, a typical Japanese response to a compliment is ‘sonno koto nai’,
meaning, ‘no that is not the case’. Another example is that prior to eating, Japanese
say ‘itadakimasu’ which conveys appreciation to everyone and everything involved in
the meal – from the farmers, to the animals and the soil, as well as the delivery driver
who brought the food to the supermarket.

In an interview, the typical embodiment of this is the ‘we, not I communication’. When
the interviewer looks at the CV, picks out a bullet point describing a successful project
and asks the candidate to describe what they did, the candidate proceeds to describe
the work of the team and how they reached the goal.

Our interviewer then assumes the candidate must have played a minor role in the
project and therefore discounts the experience and achievement. The solution is to
understand the contextual communication and dig deeper. Asking again about the
project and about the candidate’s personal contribution will extract the answer that
the interviewer was initially looking for.

For those interviewers who typically hire in the U.S., UK or even more Westernized
Asian cultures such as Singapore, they’re used to taking the candidates’ description of
their achievements with a grain of salt because the competitive nature of those

23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

cultures often leads to an exaggeration of one’s achievements. When in Japan, flip the
script.

Is the candidate really interested?
A common misread of foreign interviewers is on a candidate’s level of interest in the
job based on how they present themselves and communicate in the interview. It is
very common for Japanese professionals to state that they’re not actually looking for a
job. The interviewer then feels that this may be a waste of time and that the candidate
lacks interest or passion for the opportunity.

Understanding that Japanese professionals often have a high level of loyalty and pride
in their company is key. Though they’re not actively looking, this should not be taken
as a statement that they’re not interested. Rather, it means that they lack sufficient
information whether to decide to leave their current position and join yours.

Negativity bias plays a part in this as well. Many foreigners see the Japanese as risk
averse, but a more accurate description would be that they carefully and objectively
analyze risks. When presented with a new idea, the natural first thought is ‘what could
go wrong’ rather than ‘what is the potential upside’.

This leads to a Japanese professional asking questions in an interview in order to
better understand downside risks; whereas the Western professional’s line of
questioning will likely drive toward what can be done to maximize upside potential.


These communication nuances often leave the overseas interviewer sharing feedback
to our agency that the candidate seemed disinterested, lacked confidence in the
business and doesn’t want to leave her company anyway!

But when we catch up with the candidate to debrief, they are bubbling with
excitement. From gathering more information about the company, the role, the vision
in the interview, and the interviewer allaying some of their concerns and managing risk
during the Q&A session, they have more context and confidence in the opportunity
and strongly hope to proceed.

Every culture has its own nuances and peculiarities. On the spectrum of high context
and low context communication, egalitarian and hierarchical, and how confrontational
people are in discussions, there’s a wide gap between Japan and many Western
countries.

Taking the time to slow down communication, probing more deeply, and asking for
clarification will be key steps to communicate and hire smoothly in Japan.

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Solar power
Ark Energy applied for a 500 MW solar-plus-storage project in New South Wales that
will incorporate a 275 MW /2.2 GWh BESS with eight hours of capacity, making it
amongst the largest connected to the National Electricity Market. Ark Energy is a
subsidiary of Korea Zinc Co, a zinc smelter.

China / Power grid
This year, the State Grid Corp will complete 600 billion yuan in grid investment, an
increase of 71 billion yuan over 2023. The funds will strengthen the connection
between local power grids and large power grids, upgrade their digitalization, and
promote the transmission of large wind power and PV in western regions.

China / Solar panels
China reported a record 120 GW of solar module capacity exports in the first half of
2024, ensuring the country remains the dominant solar supplier. China has exported
nearly 720 GW of solar module capacity since 2020, said think tank Ember.

India / Equity sale
Adani Group held its first fundraising in equity markets since a $2.5 billion share sale
was canceled in Feb 2023. Last week, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Qatar
Investment Authority took a $1 billion stake in Adani Energy Solutions.

India / Nuclear power
India's nuclear power program reached a milestone last week when the Atomic
Energy Regulatory Board approved fuel loading and low-power testing for the 500-
MW prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu.

LNG
Asia continues to draw LNG from Europe. Imports in July rose the most in six months,
even as spot prices stayed near seven-month highs. The region is on track for imports
of 24.85 MMT, up from 22.6 MMT in June, and which is the highest since January's
26.2 MMT, according to Kpler.

Philippines / Electricity
The country has achieved 93.12% electrification as of Q1 2024. By the start of 2025,
the Philippines aims to increase this to 94.83%, and achieve full electrification by
2028.

Oil imports
In July, Asia's crude oil imports dropped to the lowest in two years as demand
remained weak in China and eased in India. A total of 24.88 mbpd arrived in Asia,
down 6.1% from June, and the lowest on a daily basis since July 2022, according to
LSEG Oil Research.

Singapore / Biomass
To help advance green data centers, PacificLight Energy inked a 10-year deal with
Rexus Bioenergy to supply local Google facilities with renewable energy generated
from a 13-MW waste wood-to-energy plant

Vietnam / LNG
To promote LNG use and protect consumers from high prices, Vietnam set a price cap
on generators' sales of electricity fuelled by imported LNG. But power producers are
concerned that the cap fails to reflect the LNG market’s volatility and will make gas-
fired plants uneconomical if prices spike as they did in 2022.
