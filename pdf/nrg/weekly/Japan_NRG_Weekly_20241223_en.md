NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Govt seeks to increase share of renewables up to 50% in new Basic Energy Plan

(Government statement, Dec 17)
•  On Dec 17, METI unveiled a draft of the updated Basic Energy Plan outlining the main direction for
the nation’s energy policy.
Renewables
•  The govt set an ambitious goal to at least double, or ideally, triple the share of renewables in the
national energy mix. In 2021, the target share for renewables for 2030 was set at 36-38%; but the

new Plan envisions a 40-50% share of the total by 2040.
•  The main focus is on expanding renewables as the primary power source and diversifying the
national energy mix to avoid over-reliance on a specific source, while phasing down fossil fuels and
minimizing costs associated with decarbonization.
•  With this revision, the govt changed the target time-frame from 2030 in the 6th Plan to 2040,
allowing more flexible ranges for new targets.

Energy consumption
•  METI estimates the volume of electricity consumption in 2040 at 1,100-1,200 TWh. In FY2023 it
stood at 985.4 TWh. The Plan estimates the volume of electricity generated from renewables to
increase from the current 225.6 TWh to 480-600 TWh.
•  The govt wants to at least double Japan’s energy self-sufficiency from the current 15.2%, expecting
it to increase to 30-40%.
•  METI expects total energy consumption to decrease to around 260-280 million kiloliters of oil

equivalent (2040) from 300 million kiloliters of oil equivalent (2023) due to energy conservation,
despite the increase in electricity generation.
•  CONTEXT: If converted into kilowatt-hours of electricity, total energy consumption would be
forecast at 2,800-3,000 TWh in 2040, compared to 3,200 kWh in 2023.
Emissions
•  One major change included the target for reducing GHGs over FY2013 levels, set in the new 2040

plan at 73%; a significant increase from the target for 2030, set at 46%.
Nuclear
•  The govt set the 2040 target share for nuclear power at around 20%, slightly lower than the 2030
target of 20-22%. The govt eyes the use and restart of idle NPPs on the premise of ensuring safety
and building next-gen reactors. These “replacement” units will be allowed on sites that are

different from those where existing units will be decommissioned.
Solar and wind
•  METI expects an increase in solar power, seeking to enhance use of surfaces like building rooftops
and walls with perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The govt seeks to commercialize PSCs, aiming for 20
GW in installed capacity by 2040. The govt will further promote offshore wind power, especially
floating wind power tech that can reach out into the EEZ.

Biomass
•  The new Plan also focuses on local production, distribution and consumption of biomass power.
The govt plans to work more closely with local agriculture and forestry businesses amid challenges
such as rising fuel costs, which has been a main reason for delays in moving forward with a number
of commissioned projects.
•  The govt will also promote the practical application of closed-loop, supercritical geothermal, and

enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) as a way to expand locations where this type of energy can
be deployed.
Hydrogen and carbon capture
•  The Plan stresses that next-gen fuels — hydrogen, ammonia, synthetic fuels, biofuels — will be key
for achieving carbon neutrality.
•  Solutions like CCUS are essential for achieving energy security, economic growth, and

decarbonization in the hard to abate sectors; CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) is essential for
offsetting residual emissions.
Raw materials
•  The draft Plan says that critical minerals such as copper and rare earth metals will play a pivotal role
in developing tech aimed at decarbonization and digitalization. Addressing supply risks will require

diversifying sources, securing stockpiles, and exploring domestic marine mineral resources.
•  CONTEXT: By the end of December, the govt plans to present drafts of its global crisis
countermeasures plan and the 2040 vision for energy transition (GX). These, along with the Basic
Energy Plan, will form the "three documents" subject to public consultation.
•  CONTEXT: The GX 2040 Vision has been developed through discussions at the GX Executive
Council and working groups at the PM's Office. It will draw up a picture of the industrial structure
and industrial locations that will encourage decarbonization investment. It will also present specific

measures for carbon pricing.
•  The Cabinet is expected to give approval in February, after which the govt will submit its 2035
GHG reduction targets (NDC) to the UN, also in February.
•  The revised Plan reflects changes in the past few years in both the domestic and international
political landscape. Since the formulation of the 6th Plan in 2021, the demand for economic
security has increased due to war in Ukraine and in the Middle East. Japan, like other regions, is

expecting greater demand for electricity in line with the proliferation of AI, data centers, and
progress in decarbonization.
• TAKEAWAY: Media attention in the past week has gravitated to the Plan’s outlook for nuclear. But the big
winner in this draft is surely the renewables sector, which looks set to be Japan’s main source of power; nuclear
is seen as a crutch to offer system stability. The nuclear angle appeals to the global audience and those with
either strong pro or anti-nuclear views. It is merited in part due to wording changes from the 6th Plan, which
talked down the need for leaning on nuclear beyond what is absolutely necessary. However, from a business

perspective, the opportunities offered by this strategy are much clearer in renewables. In terms of electricity
volumes, the Plan suggests the possibility of a quadrupling from today’s levels. Meanwhile, nuclear’s big
headline numbers lack details on where, with what financial means and support, liability definitions, and who
will put the ideas into practice. After all, there are only two or three EPCOs in Japan that can be described as
nuclear power players of any size. TEPCO has yet to join the ranks of nuclear operators with an actual
operating station. Another cloud of uncertainty hangs over sources like hydrogen and ammonia, with specific
targets missing. That may be simply an issue of timing, with the hydrogen CfD program only just starting. Still,

Japan’s hydrogen economy vision needs a more concrete pathway if it is to challenge existing power fuels like
coal and LNG.

KEPCO president calls for Basic Energy Plan to include nuclear energy details
(Nikkei, Dec 16)
•  In an interview, KEPCO President Mori Nozomi discussed the next Basic Energy Plan, saying it
should include details and forecasts about nuclear power to facilitate decisions on new NPP
construction or replacements; adding that the timetable for new nuclear projects depends on
factors such as local support.

•  He doesn’t see the completion of the Rokkasho spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plant as a
prerequisite for new NPPs.
•  Also, KEPCO will invest ¥380 billion to upgrade LNG power generation at its Nanko plant. And the
utility is considering hydrogen production in India. Yet, it withdrew from a hydrogen project in
Queensland, Australia, due to unprofitability.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Heads of FEPC and JGA welcome new draft of Basic Energy Plan
(Nikkei, Dec 20)
o  Hayashi Kingo, chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan (FEPC),
praised the draft of the Basic Energy Plan. He is also head of Chubu Electric, and
welcomed the support of nuclear power alongside renewable energy. Hayashi

emphasized the need for clearer guidelines on nuclear power development and for
easing restrictions on new NPPs.
o  The draft sets a target for the 2040 national energy mix. Hayashi said hitting the targets
will require "every possible measure" and stressed the responsibility of utilities.
o  The Plan also proposes relaxing conditions for replacing aging nuclear reactors, but,

without new facilities, maintaining the 2040 level of nuclear output by 2050 would be
difficult, said Hayashi.
o  Uchida Takashi, head of the Japan Gas Association (and head of Tokyo Gas), also
commented, highlighting the importance of securing long-term LNG contracts.



METI publishes results of power generation cost comparison study
(Government statement, Dec 16)
•  METI's working group on Power Generation Cost Verification presented its findings as part of a
review for the Basic Energy Plan. The main focus was the per-kWh costs of building and operating

new power generation facilities in 2023 and 2040.
•  It compared and tested different power generation: LNG, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, geothermal,
biomass, hydrogen, ammonia, and coal. It projects a cost of ¥12.5/ kWh for nuclear, assuming a
40-year reactor lifespan with a 70% operational rate.
•  Solar would be ¥7-8.9/ kWh; offshore wind would be ¥14.4-15.1/ kWh; LNG would be ¥16-21/
kWh; hydrogen would be ¥24.6-33/ kWh; and coal (with 20% ammonia co-firing) would be ¥20.9-

33/ kWh.
•  CONTEXT: The figures include so-called “policy costs” linked to domestic power generation, such
as safety measures, technology development, and compliance.
•  There are also costs related to CO2 measures that apply to LNG, oil, coal, and gas cogeneration.
Other costs are fuel, operation and maintenance costs and capital expenses. For nuclear, accident
risk response costs were also taken into account.
•  The study also looks at three scenarios, in which the amount of electricity derived from variable

renewable sources, such as solar and wind, is at 40%, 50% and 60%.
•  The results of the study show that a higher introduction of variable renewables leads to higher
costs of operating thermal power generation, and there are increased energy losses due to
charging and discharging using pumped storage and storage batteries, as well as rising curtailment
of renewable energy output.
•  The experts behind the report also commented on the use of demand response (DR), saying it
should be promoted in order to reduce the costs of incorporating each power source into the

system.
• TAKEAWAY: While these figures are useful for building a comprehensive energy plan, the results are part of an
ongoing process. We have to take into account extra factors such as location-specific impacts and system
integration costs. In any case, LNG was considered the cheapest energy source in 2021; but, having added the
expenses of CO2 emission reduction, costs have increased. Now, solar and nuclear power are considered the
cheapest. But solar is forecasted to be cheaper in 2040 than nuclear only when the penetration of variable

renewables is at 40% of capacity. With high renewable integration (e.g., 60% of the power mix), solar costs rise
significantly (¥36.9/ kWh), making nuclear (¥18.9/ kWh) more cost-effective. This shows how important system-
level costs and grid stability are to overall calculations, but it also forecasts prices based on existing

infrastructure (and its constraints). Developers may add that such forecasts are out of sync with the revenue
levels they need to turn a profit in a landscape of rising materials, labor and EPC costs.
Accurate forecasting of pricing for power sources more than a decade from now is nearly impossible. So many

factors can entirely change the calculus. Massive investment in the grid could revamp the way the system
works. So, what is the goal of these numbers? They help the govt to build a case for further support of nuclear
power, and show how investment in solar and wind should be ample but measured. That won’t satisfy
everyone, but it does give the govt a platform to defend its GX strategy.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan approves supplementary budget with energy subsidies
(Nikkei, Dec 17)
o  The govt approved a ¥13.94 trillion supplementary budget for FY2024, surpassing the
previous year’s ¥13.2 trillion; ¥6.69 trillion will be financed through new state bonds.
o  Electricity and gas subsidies will resume in January 2025 and run through March to ease
winter household burdens.
o  Gasoline subsidies will also continue in 2025, capping prices at around ¥185/ liter.




METI/ ANRE eye new categories to support adoption of PSC
(Government statement, Dec 17)
•  METI and ANRE plan a new classification of power generation facilities under the FIT and FIP
schemes to support the adoption of perovskite solar cells (PSC).
•  ANRE proposed starting support for PSCs facilities when their production costs fall below
electricity charges.
•  METI wants to focus on a next-gen solar cell strategy to foster market independence through

public-private collaboration and monitoring budgetary support for adoption.
•  CONTEXT: The govt seeks to have 20 GW of PSCs installed by 2040 and is working on measures
to support expansion. ANRE aims for a generation cost of ¥10–14/ kWh for PSCs, with some
domestic firms planning to commercialize the tech in FY2025.



Carbon credits trading for large emitters to kick off in autumn 2027
(Government statement, Dec 19)
•  Japan’s GX Promotion Office announced the framework for a carbon emissions trading system to

begin in FY2026, targeting companies emitting over 100,000 tons of CO₂ annually, including their
subsidiaries.
•  Companies must calculate their direct emissions each year and retire emission credits equivalent to
this amount. They’ll face third-party verification and report to the govt annually. Failure to offset
emissions by the deadline will incur penalties.
•  To reduce red tape, the system integrates with existing reporting mechanisms under the Energy

Conservation Act and Global Warming Countermeasures Act. Subsidiaries meeting the 100,000-
ton threshold can consolidate reporting with parent companies.
•  Excess or shortfall in emissions allowances will be traded on a state-licensed market operated by
the GX Promotion Organization, set to start in autumn 2027.

•  CCUS and forest absorption under the scheme will be considered in the future.
• TAKEAWAY: This topic has had a steady drip of news recently, yet it has passed under the radar amid the
national energy strategy discussions. Caps on carbon emissions will cost oil refiners and chemical companies,
as well as steel and ceramic manufacturers, a significant amount. Next year, the details of the accounting and
trading mechanisms will be clearer, but firms have just two years to set up full-on reporting mechanisms and

another year to understand how to trade credits. Japan NRG’s parent company’s GxxD reports recently
examined the role that carbon accounting firms will play in the economy. See https://www.yuri-
group.co.jp/gxxd for more information.



Onagawa Town to introduce spent nuclear fuel tax
(NHK, Dec 13)
•  Onagawa mayor Suda Yoshiaki wants a spent nuclear fuel tax targeting Tohoku Electric, hoping to

take effect in FY2026.
•  The Onagawa NPP's Unit 2 will add two new storage facilities for housing spent fuel. The first will
begin operations in 2029.
•  In response, Onagawa hopes that the tax will encourage the early removal of spent fuel from the
town. Details, such as the tax rate, will be finalized within the current fiscal year and discussed with
Tohoku Electric.
•  Ishinomaki City, which hosts Onagawa NPP, is considering a similar tax.

• TAKEAWAY: Currently, Onagawa NPP’s storage pool is 80% full and could reach full capacity by 2029. The
national plan envisions a nuclear fuel recycling program, but repeated delays building the reprocessing facility
at Rokkasho has led utilities to explore alternatives. Now, they are resorting to on-site, dry storage facilities for
spent nuclear fuel. But this causes friction with locals, who want the spent fuel to be stored far from the NPPs.



Aomori Pref outlines draft plan for renewables tax

(Government statement, Dec 19)
•  Aomori Pref outlined a draft for an ordinance for a renewable energy coexistence tax; it will be
classified as a non-statutory ordinary tax.
•  The tax will apply to solar and onshore wind power operators. Rates will vary based on the type of
energy and zoning categories:
o  Solar: Adjustment areas: ¥110/ kW; Conservation/ protection areas: ¥410/ kW;
o  Wind: Adjustment areas: ¥300/ kW; Conservation/ protection areas: ¥1,990/ kW.

•  Exempted will be existing facilities and those that began public notification of environmental
impact statements or filed construction plans.
•  New facilities located in designated "coexistence zones" under the prefecture's zoning plan will
also be tax-exempt. Installations on building roofs and facilities owned by national or local govts
will also be tax-exempt.
•  CONTEXT: Aomori is the latest prefecture to push forward with new local taxes on renewables,

following the example of Miyagi, whose tax ordinance came into effect in April 2024. At least one
other region had considered taking similar steps.

• TAKEAWAY: Local officials say the aim of the taxes is to steer developers away from areas that are ecologically
at risk or troublesome for communities. But there is a sense also that regional governments are seizing on
opportunities to supplement shrinking budgets with payments from a growing industry. The short-term impact
will be the cancellation of most projects in the high-tax areas. Officials have said, however, that they will allow
new developments without tax should developers secure local buy-in for a project. Perhaps, then, the tax can

also be seen as a smart way to improve the community-developer relationships.



MLIT discusses construction plans for floating offshore wind
(Government statement, Dec 13)
•  The MLIT began discussions on developing offshore construction scenarios for floating offshore
wind power projects. The first meeting will be Dec 17.
•  These talks will take place in a public-private working group for maritime and port organizations,

academics, construction firms, shipbuilders, and shipping companies.
•  The panel aims to create multiple construction scenarios based on different types of floating
foundations.
•  CONTEXT: While the meetings will generally remain private, some summaries and materials will be
published on the public-private forum's website.



Idemitsu Kosan to join CCS project in Norway

Hokkaido offering tax cuts to lure green energy, finance as AI power needs surge

(Japan NRG, Dec 17)
•  The Hokkaido governor pledged to cut local taxes and other subsidies to woo more clean energy
firms to build facilities.
•  Governor Suzuki Naomichi said the tax incentives will be offered within the so-called Financial and
Asset Management Special Zone being created in Sapporo as part of the national GX strategy.
•  Corporate tax cuts will be available for prefectural, municipal, and fixed asset levies. The tax breaks
will go for up to10 years and target new businesses from outside Hokkaido, as well as local
startups.
•  Hokkaido needs to secure more renewable energy to support the buildout of AI and big energy

users such as the Rapidus semiconductor plant now under construction.
•  CONTEXT: Suzuki spoke at the Nikkei’s GX/Financial Conference in Sapporo, which ran Dec 16-17.
A summary of some of the comments from the event:
o  Air Water’s head Matsubayashi Ryosuke wants regulatory easing through special
economic zones to align with Europe and the U.S. Air Water is producing and selling
biogas-derived hydrogen in Hokkaido.
o  Suwabe Tetsuya, head of Eurus Energy, said that weak connections to Japan’s mainland

grid are a challenge for wind power in Hokkaido. Eurus seeks to attract data center
projects to northern Hokkaido.
o  Hironobu Tsuyama, head of North Pacific Bank, said his bank has made ¥210 billion in
GX-related loans and is considering another ¥60 billion in lending to support the influx of
data centers in Hokkaido.
o  Sawa Masahiko, vice president of Idemitsu Kosan, expressed plans to build a global

supply network for synthetic fuels. He mentioned the hydrogen production hub in
Tomakomai, using renewable energy.
o  ENEOS Holdings’ senior VP/CTO Fujiyama Yuichiro highlighted the high costs of
domestic renewable energy and emphasized the importance of local synthetic fuel
production for energy security.
•  Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), Sapporo City, and Hokkaido made a joint statement. CBI will

provide expertise to expand financial capabilities in the region, and will counsel on the creation of
certification systems to meet global standards. This marks the first such statement by the CBI and a
Japanese municipality.

Hokkaido Electric CEO says renewables need nuclear to balance; will shut small generators
(Nikkei, Dec 17)
o  Hokkaido Electric’s CEO Saito said the utility will shutter smaller power generation plants

with high repair costs and push on with efforts to restart Tomari NPP, as part of measures
to lower electricity prices in the region.


13



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Hokkaido’s snowfall and freezing weather makes thermal power generation less cost-
effective due to logistics and fuel demand. While pushing for more renewables to be
developed locally, Saito said it was unrealistic to support heavy industry and big power
users like Rapidus and data centers without baseload sources like NPPs.
o  In 2027, Hokkaido expects a surplus from existing power plants, just as the Rapidus

semiconductor plant starts mass production. However, as the semiconductor industry
ramps up locally, Saito expects a need for more power volumes.
o  In 2030, Hokkaido Electric will start operating a second LNG-fired unit at the Ishikari Bay
Shinko power station.
o  CONTEXT: Upon the restart of Tomari NPP, the percentage of CO2-free electricity in
Hokkaido is expected to rise to nearly 60% from about 40% today.
• TAKEAWAY: Hokkaido was one of the key regions for kickstarting the solar and wind sectors, and most

recently the battery industry. Today, it seeks to become a magnet for green financing, hoping that the high
renewables component will attract industry keen to tap into these volumes. What may underpin the
renewables boom is the restart of not just Tomari NPP but also Oma and Higashidori NPPs on the north tip of
Aomori that borders Hokkaido. There are many challenges before this could be a reality, but the possibility of
Hokkaido becoming an industrial engine of growth in Japan thanks to clean energy is there.

ANALYSIS

BY JAPAN NRG TEAM

A Look Back at the Year in Energy – 2024

With the release of the draft Basic Energy Plan last week, most eyes are on the future.
Where does Japan’s government and experts see the nation developing over the next
decades? Is the country still on course for net-zero by 2050, as mandated by law?

These questions of strategy are important and fascinating, but energy is a sector that
relies on small, ongoing progress – the little victories – to evolve. The change that
actually occurs is rarely prophesied in 100-page presentations. The IEA’s infamous
record of failing to predict the speed of solar PV development in almost every one of
its reports over the past 15 years can attest to how difficult it is to divine the course of
the energy sector.

This overview of Japan’s energy sector takes on a simpler task: to record some of
these tiny victories and include the near-term events that drive each form of power
generation. As the below shows, it was far from a quiet year.

Hydrogen and Ammonia
If 2017 is the year that Japan published the world’s first national strategy for
hydrogen, then 2024 is the year that hydrogen and its gaseous brethren (ammonia,
methanol, synth gas, etc.) finally stepped into the mainstream. To be sure, this was a
first step and, some might say a misstep, but it was a definitive change of phase in
development, from pilot projects and paper plans to the beginning of mass usage.

JERA successfully completed the world’s first trial of commercial-scale use of ammonia
as a second fuel at its Hekinan thermal power plant. Soon after, Idemitsu did the same
in a commercial naphtha cracking furnace (i.e. a facility that makes the raw materials
for plastics).


Godzilla movie-maker Toho studios signed Japan’s first commercial supply of
electricity from a hydrogen-fired power plant. Construction of Japan’s largest green
hydrogen plant began at Suntory’s whiskey distillery in Yamanashi Pref (16 MW power-
2-gas), with commissioning due in 2025.

Government support has been crucial to this development of what is dubbed the
Hydrogen Society. In May, the Diet passed the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act,
which went into effect in October. The Act put in place a clear definition of what
constitutes a ‘low-carbon’ hydrogen fuel and the same for its related compounds. It
also created the conditions for a state subsidies scheme known as the Contract for
Difference (CfD), which started to accept applications in late November. The CfD will
compensate the end-users of hydrogen of the additional expense of switching to the
clean-burning fuel compared with fossil fuels. CfD applications will close by April
2025, with officials claiming that the scheme targets hard-to-abate sectors and not
only power generation.

The CfD was, in fact, the second subsidy scheme for those looking to get weaned off
hydrocarbons. The first, targeted at power utilities, was the long-term decarbonization

power source auction (LTDA), which started in January and by late spring awarded
support to 0.83 GW of hydrogen and ammonia co-firing capacity for power stations
that will adapt to utilize those fuels.

Meanwhile, METI is also accepting applications from hydrogen and ammonia supply
chain makers. The ministry selected 10 projects in the first round and will conduct a
second round before the end of FY2024. The end goal is to create eight hydrogen
hubs around the country, with only three in the big cities and the rest in smaller cities
and the regions.

For domestic engineering firms, this is a happy time. For example, Kawasaki Heavy
Industries has unveiled a 7.5 MW gas engine that can run on 30% hydrogen and a
500-kW gas engine that uses only this fuel. IHI and MHI have similarly signaled the
potential to create turbines and engines that run exclusively on hydrogen or ammonia
– if there’s demand.

The issue, as always, is the price. For now, Japan is hoping that costs can be lowered
through scale and international cooperation. In June 2024, the Japan-EU Hydrogen
Business Forum was held in Tokyo, and the Japan-ROK Hydrogen and Derivatives
Cooperation Dialogue was held in Seoul.

Solar Power
Electricity derived from solar panels now supplies about 10% of the national power
mix. But there has been a notable increase in slowdown in the rollout of new utility-
scale solar capacity in the last two years. The government has sought to revive that
growth through promoting next-gen technologies and grid integration incentives.


Perhaps this year’s most outstanding achievement was advancing the
commercialization of flexible, lightweight Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). This innovative
tech can be installed on unconventional surfaces such as building walls and curved
structures, thereby harnessing underutilized surfaces.

Companies like Sekisui Chemical and Panasonic are pioneering PSCs, with large-scale
demonstrations already underway, including installations on walls of data centers and
public facilities. Panasonic has advanced scalable PSC production, aligning with
government targets to reduce manufacturing costs to ¥20/ W by 2025, and ¥14/ W by
2030. Japan aims to deploy at least 20 GW of perovskite by 2040 both as stand-alone
PSC panels and as additional PSC layers added to conventional polysilicon solar
panels.

Floating solar installations also gained traction this year as a means to address a
dearth of available land for energy projects, particularly focusing on coastal areas and
reservoirs. These efforts were pioneered by real estate developer Tokyu Land and
Dutch offshore solar power firm SolarDuck, which in May installed Japan’s first
offshore floating solar PV power plant on the surface in the Central Breakwater Area of
Tokyo Bay.

Japan also advanced plans to beam solar energy from space back to Earth using
microwave transmission. This tech, developed by Kyoto University and supported by

JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), aims to tackle issues of limited sunlight
on Earth. Tests are progressing, with an eye toward a launch in FY2025.

BESS
One of the standout energy sectors of 2024 was undoubtedly power storage. There
were significant strides in Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), driven by both
private sector initiatives and government policies. Japan held the first major long-term
decarbonized power auction (LTDA), with BESS projects securing competitive bids.
OCCTO assigned 1.09 GW of BESS capacity across 30 projects. Among the most
successful bidders were companies like Renova, which positions itself as Japan’s only
listed fully-fledged renewables developer. Renova won three contracts for projects
totalling 215 MW.

Japanese firms and global players launched dozens of GWs of large-scale battery
storage projects nationwide. Developer Gurin Energy started work on a 500 MW, 4-
hour duration (2 GWh) project to provide 2 GWh of electricity. Demand drivers for
BESS include the increasing power needs of generative AI and data centers, and the
ever-rising levels of renewable energy curtailments.

Meanwhile, financial services company Orix, which won the single biggest BESS
contract awarded under the LTDA, commissioned its first grid-scale facility in early
December. The 48 MW / 113 MWh Kinokawa BESS is a JV with Kansai Electric. By late
2026 or early 2027, Orix hopes to have online a much larger 134 MW / 548 MWh
BESS in Maibara City, Shiga Pref, which is sponsored by the LTDA.

Other sector trends include innovation in multi-use storage systems, where BESS
technologies provide services such as frequency regulation and capacity market
participation. This reflects a shift toward a multi-service model to optimize the value of
energy storage.


Both central and local governments continue to refine their BESS policy frameworks.
METI allocated ¥9 billion to incentivize energy storage projects, focusing on grid
balancing and virtual power plant (VPP) technologies.

One area where many market participants hope to see progress in 2025 is in
financing. Banks remain reluctant to offer financing of any size for commercial battery
projects, unless it’s backed by the parent company’s balance sheet.

Wind Power
While the slow pace at which the government offers new tenders is a source of
frustration for many, overall, Japan’s wind power sector can finally be said to be taking
off. The year began with JERA announcing the start of operations at the Ishikari Bay
New Port Offshore Wind Farm, the biggest commercial scale wind power facility in
Japan at 112 MW and the first to install 8 MW turbines (Siemens Gamesa).

Even before the completion of the Round 2 tender in spring, the next round of
tenders was already launched. A January announcement offered developers to bid for
just over 1 GW of capacity at Aomori South (Aomori Pref) and Yuza Town (Yamagata
Pref). Results are expected shortly.


23

In the previous tender round, four projects with a cumulative capacity of 1.81 GW
were awarded to consortiums led by Japan Renewable Energy, JERA, Mitsui, and the
Sumitomo and TEPCO Renewable Energy partnership, respectively. Among the
winning bids was Spanish renewables firm Iberdrola, reinforcing the trend of an
increasing presence of non-Japanese firms in the sector.

Meanwhile, the government switched its focus to mapping out the sector’s longer-
term future via floating wind technology, which can be utilized in deeper waters and is
critical given Japan’s coastal geography. In March, the government approved a draft
amendment that will allow building offshore wind power capacity in the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ).

Seeking to achieve large-scale commercialization of floating wind power generation
and creating a domestic industry, a group of companies launched the Floating
Offshore Wind Technology Research Association (FLOWRA). It’s based on a
partnership with local companies and focuses on developing technologies to reduce
the costs and risks of commercializing the tech in Japan. Members include J-Power,
KEPCO, JERA, Chubu Electric, Tokyo Gas, TEPCO Renewable Power, and Eurus
Energy.

With the push towards the expansion of offshore wind power, Japan has seen some
economic ripples in coastal regions, particularly with job creation in shipbuilding,
turbine manufacturing, and maintenance sectors. The sector’s rapid growth has led to
significant labor shortages, however, prompting industry members to scramble to
introduce courses that will retrain workers for technical and safety skills.

Carbon Capture, CCS, CCUS
After selecting seven projects (five in Japan, two overseas) as the starting point of the
CCS sector in 2023, the government made a number of key updates to the
development timeline. Most importantly, it confirmed the regulatory and some of the
legal framework. The CCS Business Act came into force in May 2024, providing the
basis for regulations around safety and sector economics. The Diet also agreed to
accept an amended London Protocol, which allows for the future export of CO2. In
autumn, technical parameters pertaining to the shipping of liquid CO2 were
publicized.


The outline of the sector’s development remains largely unchanged from the initial
announcements in the summer of 2023: Japan aims to store 6–12 million tons of CO2
per year by 2030, and expand that to 120–240 million tons by 2050. The government
hopes that projects such as the first pilot facility at Tomakomai, Hokkaido, will switch
to a commercial basis by 2030. Until then, testing is focused on the shipping of liquid
CO2 by Kansai Electric to the Tomakomai hub, which is operated by Japan CCS Co.

The biggest problem for the sector remains the high cost of the CCS supply chain. To
address this, the government started compiling a preliminary framework for financial
support in December 2024. Detailed discussions are slated to begin in early 2025 and
an interim report expected by summer 2025.

LNG
In 2023, gas-fired power generation comprised 29% of Japan’s total, but overall LNG
consumption is declining. This owes in large part to the restart of nuclear reactors,
24

measures to foster energy conservation, as well as the increased use of renewables.
Without a reverse of the national energy strategy, which will be based on the draft of
the new Basic Energy Plan, Japan’s current LNG contracts would leave the country
over-supplied.

The current national energy strategy calls for gas-fired plants to shrink their
contribution to the total mix to about 20%, half that of prior years. However, the new
energy strategy, which is expected to pass by the end of this fiscal year (March 31,
2025), sees fossil fuel-fired thermal generation making up 30-40% of the national mix
in 2040 (compared to almost 70% in 2023). The draft does not specify if the fuel would
be coal or LNG (or oil), but METI has also asked utilities to keep faith in long-term
LNG contracts.

The above suggests that LNG’s fortunes will remain strong over the course of this
decade and possibly in the 2030s. Japanese buyers have been quietly strengthening
ties with existing suppliers such as the U.S. and Australia in recent months, and also
testing options elsewhere.

Japan’s investments in Australia helped develop the North West Shelf LNG industry;
and JERA recently acquired a 15.1% stake in Woodside Energy’s Scarborough project,
with the JBIC approving a $1 billion loan for its development. Yet, Australia’s new gas
emission regulations and the U.S. moratorium on new LNG export approvals have
posed challenges.

In the Middle East, Oman LNG inked a 10-year supply deal with JERA. Osaka Gas
signed a long-term agreement with ADNOC for Ruwais LNG, commencing in 2028.
The key to maintaining a strong LNG component will be how to mitigate the risk of
price hikes and volatility in short-term demand. To address this, METI has redoubled
efforts to establish a meaningful domestic strategic gas reserve.


The other focus point will be bringing down LNG’s carbon footprint, as much as it is
possible for a hydrocarbon. This is where the Coalition for LNG Emission Abatement
Toward Net Zero (CLEAN) initiative comes in. Launched last year by JERA, Korea Gas
and JOGMEC, it expanded this year to include 22 Japanese utilities and trading
houses Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co. The Coalition seeks to reduce methane
emissions through data collection and project-level monitoring, thanks to Japan and
Korea's influence on the LNG market.

Finally, what will happen to the soon-to-expire contracts to buy LNG from Russia’s
Sakhalin II? Economics and logistics say that Japanese buyers will renew the contracts.
But politics and net-zeronomics suggest they won’t. How PM Ishiba sides on the issue
will be crucial.

Nuclear
Despite PM Ishiba holding a cool stance on nuclear power before the election that
brought him to power, his government seems willing to continue with the nuclear
course. METI plans to maintain nuclear’s share of the national electricity mix at 20% in
its 2040 energy target, the same ratio as for the 2030 target. It emphasizes rebuilding
nuclear plants on existing sites, but said it will allow utilities leeway to select other
locations. Either way, reaching the 2030 target implies at least doubling the number
of reactors that Japan has online.

After almost a decade of efforts to restart reactors, Japan has 14 units online out of a
total of 33. Recent months have seen notable progress. Initially, the only reactors that
managed to secure both regulatory and local government approvals were in West
Japan and that utilized the pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology. Many of the
NPPs in East Japan, however, utilize boiling water reactors (BWRs), the same type
deployed at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP.

Finally, in 2024, two BWRs restarted operations: at Onagawa NPP, and Shimane NPP.
The latter is also in West Japan, while the Onagawa station is in the Tohoku region,
marking the first restart in East Japan.

For most nuclear utilities there’s another ongoing battle – prolonging the operation of
aging reactors. In October, Kansai Electric received NRA approval to continue
operation at Takahama NPP, Japan’s oldest working unit at 50 years in service.
Approvals for renewed permits to operate now have to be secured every decade for
reactors of 30 years and older.

Meanwhile, the gargantuan task of decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi NPP remains
as complex and difficult as ever. TEPCO began work on the experimental removal of
debris, but faced a setback in September. Work resumed in October.

Oil
Japan’s oil sector is in a gradual, structural decline. In March 2024, Idemitsu Kosan
shuttered yet another refinery, just six months after ENEOS had stopped operations at
its Wakayama plant. Together, the two facilities accounted for about 250,000 barrels
(per day) of refining capacity. As of May, there were about 20 refineries still in
operation nationwide, but the biggest one – ENEOS’s Mizushima plant – can only
process 350,000 barrels a day.


One of the unexpected side-effects of this idling of refineries has been a shortage of
industrial-grade CO2 in Japan. Carbon dioxide is captured as a byproduct at oil
refineries. Today, imports of CO2 for the chemical sector and other applications are
rising and so are the prices for a gas that, ironically, most companies and countries
want to get rid of.

While oil refiners adapt their shuttered sites to clean energy facilities to reduce their
carbon footprint, imports of crude oil remain little changed since 2020. In the first 10
months of 2024, Japan imported 111.2 billion liters (about 23 Mbpd) of crude oil.

Annual imports don’t look likely to exceed the 2023 total. However, a demand decline
is likely to accelerate later this decade. The government has finally agreed to promote
a higher blending of biofuels with gasoline. Ethanol or similar biofuels currently make
up 3% or less of the gasoline blend sold at service stations around Japan. In
November, METI said it wants the percentage to rise to 10% by FY2030 and up to
20% in the early 2030s.

In terms of security of supply, Japan continues to rely on the Middle East for 95% of
its crude. In 2024, the UAE took over Saudi Arabia as the top supplier. Small
quantities also come from Mexico and Canada, while imports from Russia, Bahrain,
and Malaysia have dried up. Calls to diversify Japan’s crude imports continue, but
there is little tangible movement on that front.

















The high prices that Japan pays for oil reflect yen weakness. So far, the average USD-
JPY rate for 2024 is ¥151.7 (ranging ¥142.73~156.9), which is 7.5% higher than the
¥141.15 average in 2023. Partly because of this higher cost to Japanese consumers,
the previous administration of PM Kishida kept fossil fuel subsidies in place for so
long. State support for gasoline kept the price flat for most of the year, ranging from
¥174.4 to ¥175.6 per liter. Without subsidies, the price would have exceeded ¥190.
Even with the subsidies, it was ¥10-¥20 higher than the average for the past four
years.

The year’s big story in petroleum products was a shortage of jet fuel. Narita Airport
was one of the most affected with dozens of flights canceled. To allay the panic,
Japanese oil refineries increased output, but it turned out that the volumes were not
the problem. Bottlenecks in logistics, such as a lack of drivers for trucks and pipeline
connections, were the main cause of the shortage, as well as a quick surge in
international flight volumes as foreign tourists flocked to Japan to take advantage of
the weak yen.


How the logistics will survive Japan’s move to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is
another uncertainty for the coming years. The national target is to have all domestic
flights source at least 10% of their fuel as SAF. Cosmo Oil is among the domestic firms
preparing for SAF commercial production at its Sakai Refinery from 2025. The issue of
the higher SAF price, however, has yet to come to the public's attention.

Coal
In the first 10 months of 2024, Japan imported a total of 136.7 million tons (Mt) of
coal, of which 83.8 Mt was thermal. Based on Japan NRG calculations and short-term
forecasts, the totals for this year are likely to be little changed or down over 2023.
That makes sense given the pressure on power utilities and industrial firms to
decarbonize.

Japan, however, has also added at least 15 new coal-fired generation units in the last
two decades. JERA brought online a new unit at its Yokosuka Power Station in
Kanagawa Pref as recently as December 2023. Kobe Steel opened Unit 4 at its coal-
fired Kobe Power Station in February 2023. Shikoku Electric started the Saijo Power
Station in June 2023.

The new facilities were planned years in advance and the trend today is for companies
to cancel coal power plant projects rather than build them. Still, utilities and industries
are not eager to shutter their thermal fleets just yet. There is an eagerness to test the
approach, led by JERA, of co-firing fossil fuels with hydrogen or ammonia that do not
emit CO2 when burned.

Several government tender schemes, including the LTDA and the CfD, are helping
power generators to access subsidies for co-firing projects. The worry is, however, that
the economics of supporting two fuels will not be kind. Last week, a pricing
committee under METI published a report on its forecasts for the 2040 power
generation cost estimates. The forecast painted ammonia co-firing with coal as more
expensive than ammonia single-firing. Similar conclusions could be drawn from the
numbers for hydrogen co-firing. And while the range of the numbers offered by METI
experts was broad and the 2040 target distant, the cost estimates should give officials
and utility companies reason for thought.



















In terms of sourcing, over 70% of Japan’s thermal coal imports came from Australia,
followed by Indonesia. Unlike in 2023, no imports came from Pakistan and the
Philippines.

Despite the weak yen, coal prices were depressed. Japan’s import price for thermal
coal averaged ¥23,850 per ton this year (ranging from ¥21,822 to ¥25,100).



















As of Dec 1, there are 181 coal thermal power generating units with a capacity of 30
MW or more in Japan; of these, 162 are in operation and have a combined 56 GW of
capacity, according to Japan Beyond Coal.

Status      No. of Plants
In Operation         162
Planning & Under Construction 1
Mothballed            5
Cancelled Planning    4
Retired               9
Total                181

The top three coal generators are JERA, J-Power, and Tohoku Electric, with nearly
50% of the total coal-fired power capacity.

Electricity Markets
This year marked a shift in Japan’s electricity market with new mechanisms like
capacity market charges and expanded balancing market operations. However,
challenges such as bid shortages, price surges, and strained supply-demand balances
persist, prompting emergency measures during peak demand periods.


The long-term decarbonization auctions revealed a preference for storage systems,
with battery projects dominating, while LNG-fired power plants nearly filled their
quotas. Rules reclaiming 90% of market revenues continue to impact investment
strategies.

The biggest story was the surge in power futures, with EEX volumes up 3.6 times YoY;
ICE joining the market at the end of the year; and TOCOM improving its liquidity
through a market-maker system. Further expectations lie in the direction of initiatives
like JJ-Link, which integrates spot and futures trading.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This column provides a brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the
past week

Australia / EVs
The govt is funding cheap loans to help people buy EVs in a bid to kickstart slumping
sales. Clean Energy Finance Corp is providing A$150 million in such discounted loans
aimed at low-income and essential workers.

Cambodia / LNG
Cambodia should reconsider plans to build a 900 MW LNG-fired power plant by
2030, when fuel costs will have risen compared with other clean energy sources, said
the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

China / Critical minerals
Critical minerals will be China's weapon in its escalating trade war with the U.S. Every
time the U.S. imposes new restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor chips,
Beijing responds by tightening controls on exports of the critical inputs for chip
manufacturers.

China / Peak Oil
In 2023, China's refined oil consumption peaked at 399 Mt (7.98 mbpd) and is
expected to fall 1.3% to 394 Mt in 2024, said CNPC Research Institute. Driven by the
shift towards EVs and trucks fuelled by LNG, China's rapid move toward peak oil is
surprising, with crude imports on track to peak in 2025. Total oil consumption is set to
peak by 2027, said refining giant Sinopec.

Climate finance
The World Resources Institute said that between 2013 and 2022 China contributed or
mobilized $45 billion to support developing countries in reducing emissions. This
accounted for about 6% of all climate finance provided by developed nations over
that time.

India / Offshore wind
Amidst plans to build offshore wind capacity, the International Institute for Sustainable
Development said it may take India at least 12 years to reach grid parity. Achieving
India’s target of 37 GW of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 requires significant
financing.

India / Oil
India is now the leading source of growth in global oil consumption, overtaking China
this year, said the EIA. China’s oil consumption grew by more than India’s in almost
every year from 1998 through 2023, with China’s oil consumption growing more than
any other country during those years. In 2024, India accounted for 25% of total oil
consumption growth globally.

India / Solar power
Trump could derail India’s solar power export ambition as the U.S. intends to increase
tariffs and limit demand for eco-friendly imports. Trump seeks a global tariff on solar
imports and is exploring duties on Southeast Asian suppliers.

Philippines / Coal
Coal still fuels 57% of the Philippines’ energy needs. The country operates 28 coal-
fired plants with a combined capacity of 9.88 GW. Meanwhile, the contribution of
renewables to the country’s power mix remains at just 22%.

South Korea / Offshore wind
The govt awarded a total of 1.89 GW in generation capacity across four fixed-bottom
offshore wind projects and one floating wind project. The projects are the 532 MW
Anma Offshore Wind (both phases); the 500 MW Taean (Vena Energy); the 104 MW
Yeonggwang Yawol (Daehan Green Power); and the 750 MW Firefly/ Bandibuli
floating wind farm (Equinor).
