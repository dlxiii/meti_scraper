MoE releases final GHG data for FY2021

(Government statement, April 21)
•  Japan’s total GHG emissions were 1.17 billion CO2 equivalent tons in the April 2021-March 2022
period, up 2% YoY.
•  Carbon capture was 47.6 million tons, up 3.6%. The net GHG release was 1.12 billion tons,
factoring in the captured carbon.
•  This will be filed to the U.N. as the official national emissions data.



METI edges closer to a new day-ahead power market that combines volumes and balancing

(Denki Shimbun, April 26)
•  A working group at METI discussed the results of its investigation into a new power market that will
combine the spot market (kWh) and balancing market (delta kWh) so that the two are traded
simultaneously on a day-ahead basis.
•  CONTEXT: At present, power retailers buy electricity on the spot market, while transmission firms
separately procure volumes needed to balance demand and supply. The trades are done on two

separate market platforms, which can lead to redundancies and inefficiencies.
•  A combined market will allow for simultaneous contract settlement.
•  The panel noted that one other way to improve the power market will be through better fuel
consumption forecasting at the stage that the fuel (LNG) is procured. More risk hedging by market
participants is also necessary, as well as better disclosure of the trades between generators and
retailers, the panel noted.
• TAKEAWAY: The new day-ahead market is inspired by the PJM system in the U.S., which operates a

synchronized reserve market. While a spot market by itself is only able to put a value on price and quantity, the
PJM system also takes into account the cost of bringing power capacity online. This can be useful for avoiding
mismatches in capacity calculations and making sure the reality of securing more generation is reflected in the
final price.



METI won’t hold additional capacity market auction this year
(Denki Shimbun, April 27)
•  METI won’t hold an additional Capacity Market auction for 2023 because it believes the power
supply for 2024 will be sufficient.
•  Biomass and coal co-firing power plants are expected to supply a certain amount of capacity, while

any shortfall across regions is forecast to be modest with the imbalance covered by generators
held in reserve.
•  Hokkaido, Tokyo and Kyushu are the areas most sensitive to capacity shortages, but METI said it
will be less costly to restart reserve generators than host more capacity auctions.

METI minister seeks heavier penalties on non-compliant power companies
(Sankei Shimbun, April 28)
•  METI Minister Nishimura instructed relevant ministry bodies to come up with appropriate measures
following charges brought against some major power utilities (EPCOs) for cartel behavior and

unauthorized data access.
•  Nishimura said he wants to see healthy competition in the power retail market and he plans to
install heavier penalties on violators. If some EPCOs access data of other operators, the offenders
will be denied access to the shared data systems.
•  The minister said he also plans to push for amendments to the Electricity Business Act to increase
the size of fines and bestow the METI minister with authority to suspend power retail operations.




ANRE seeks stringent recycling requirement for renewable operators
(Japan NRG, April 24)
•  ANRE formed a new study group on recycling and scrapping renewable facilities, to set new
recycling requirements that will cover small residential installations as well as large facilities. The
group is chaired by Prof. Takamura Yukari of Tokyo University.
•  To facilitate panel recycling, ANRE proposed requiring operators of new solar facilities to file data

on selenium, cadmium, lead, and arsenic contained in the panels.
•  When operators apply for new FIT and FIP licenses, they’ll have to submit data on the four toxic
materials in their panels.
•  ANRE will study how current regulations could raise recycling awareness also among wind power
operators since reports of abandoned wind turbines are on the rise.
•  CONTEXT: Immediate tasks include advancing research on recycling reinforced plastics used for
wind blades and securing landfill space for panel wastes.

• TAKEAWAY: Solar panel recycling poses a major challenge. As much as 280,000 tons of panels is forecast to
require disposal by 2036, accounting for as much as 2.7% of Japan's total amount of non-recyclable wastes.
Hydro, geothermal and biomass operators will also be required to speed up the dismantling of their
equipment and decommissioning once operations finish.




METI to give priority to retired oil-fired power plants for reserve power capacity
(Denki Shimbun, April 27)
•  At a Subcommittee for Electricity and Gas Basic Policy meeting on April 26, METI said it will
prioritize retired oil-fired power plants as reserve power capacity.
•  Reserve power sources are not listed as available in the capacity market (because they are retired),

but these stations are maintained so that they can be ready to supply electricity in emergencies.
•  If a power source is certified as “reserve power capacity”, the operator is paid the cost of
maintenance.
• TAKEAWAY: Before liberalization of the power market, major power utilities (the EPCOs) voluntarily
maintained retired oil-fired power plants as reserve power sources to be used during peak demand times. In a
fully competitive market, however, the utilities started to decommission aging oil-fired plants because of their

high costs. METI seeks to bring back the financial incentive for utilities to retain the capacity because it is
concerned that there is a shortage of capacity nationwide in case of emergency.



NRA to require same inspection for 40 year and 60-year life extension application
(Nikkei, April 26)
•  The NRA decided to conduct inspections of nuclear power plants that have been in operation for
more than 60 years using the same criteria as the special inspections conducted at the 40-year
mark.
•  Normally, nuclear plants are only allowed to operate for 40 years unless they are granted an

extension. In order to get that, plant operators must conduct additional inspections of the reactor
pressure vessel, containment vessel, and concrete structures.
•  Plant operators may also be allowed to use alternative methods to prove the safety of their
facilities if they can provide evidence that this will achieve the same results.
• TAKEAWAY: This is largely a procedural item, but it does indicate a certain flexibility from the regulator, at
least on the surface. Preparing for inspections is a long and laborious process. If the procedure can be

replicated at the 60-year mark, it will help operators deal with it more efficiently.



Japan receives first low-carbon ammonia from Saudi Arabia

(Reuters, April 21)
•  The first low-carbon ammonia cargo from Saudi Arabia arrived in Japan; it will be used for co-firing
with fossil fuels in order to reduce total CO2 emissions in power generation.
•  Ammonia shipped to Fuji Oil’s Sodegaura refinery (Chiba) was produced by SABIC Agri-Nutrients
using feedstock from Aramco and the cargo was delivered by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.
•  CONTEXT: Japan is adding hydrogen and ammonia to its energy mix and aims to boost fuel
ammonia demand to 3 million tons per year by 2030 from nearly zero at present. Japan’s biggest

power generator JERA has been co-firing ammonia with coal in a trial project since 2021.



Kubota to invest ¥1 billion to enter market for EV battery materials
(Company statement, April 25)
•  Kubota will enter the battery material market by mass producing titanium-niobium composite
oxide, to be used for the cathode (negative electrode) of lithium-ion batteries.
•  The company will invest ¥1 billion at its Amagasaki factory in Hyogo Pref to start production in late

2024, gradually increasing from 50 tons of material per month.
•  Previously, graphite was used as the cathode material in Li-ion batteries, but the company believes
titanium-niobium composite oxide is superior as it allows for longer battery life and faster recharge
times. End users will be manufacturers of batteries for EVs.

First geothermal power plant to be designated "important power source" by METI
(Denki Shimbun, April 26)
•  Idemitsu Kosan, INPEX and Mitsui Oil Exploration said their 15 MW geothermal power plant to be
built in Yuzawa, Akita Pref, was designated as an "important power source" site by METI. It’s the

first geothermal power plant to receive this designation.
•  Work is underway and the plant will be operational in March 2027. The electricity generated will be
sold to the Tohoku Electric at ¥40/ kWh under the FIT system.
• TAKEAWAY: METI designates sites as "important power source" in order to facilitate procedures by the
relevant ministries and agencies. It also serves the purpose of gaining local consensus. Geothermal power
plants often face resistance from hot springs owners, as they fear it will cause a drop in water pressure and
temperature at their services.



Hitachi demos tech for improving power grid efficiency in Thailand

(Company statement, April 26)
•  Hitachi installed a performance-enabling network in the power transmission system of Thailand’s
Electricity Generating Authority.

(JCM) system and to coin CO2 credits through third-party entity verification.
•  CONTEXT: NEDO and Thailand’s Ministry of Energy (MoEN) have a demo project in low carbon
and energy efficiency with Hitachi as the contractor.



Concern about experience of staff at TEPCO’s only nuclear power plant
(Yomiuri Shimbun, April 27)
•  METI plans to restart Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP Units 6 and 7 in summer 2025.
•  About 260 people work at Units 1 to 7. However, 30% of them have little experience operating the

plant. TEPCO trains them using simulators and by sending them to thermal power plants to gain
experience.
•  Overall, TEPCO struggles to find new staff for Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP.
• TAKEAWAY: Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s reactors have long been idle. Units 2 and 3 haven’t operated since 2007;
Unit 4 since 2008; Units 1 and 7 since 2011; and Units 5 and 6 since 2012. In such a situation of prolonged

idleness, staff have certainly lost their expertise.

•  In March, Japan imported 323,573 tons of LNG from Oman, exceeding the 214,437 tons from
Qatar.
•  Historically, Japan has imported three times more from Qatar than Oman; Since last year it has

been shifting away from Qatari supplies due to inflexible shipping conditions, according to
JOGMEC.
•  Japan imported 267,553 tons of LNG from the U.S. in March. The volume from the U.S. has been
declining, from 447,475 tons in December. Like Oman, the U.S. cargoes are mostly destination
free.
•  The LNG imports were 5.7 million tons in total, down 12% YoY.

UAE surpasses Saudi Arabia as Japan's top oil exporter
(Government data, April 27)
•  Crude oil imports from the UAE were 5.1 million kiloliters (32 million barrels) in March, surpassing
Saudi Arabia as Japan’s top supplier.
•  Japan imported a total of 12.98 million kiloliters (82 million barrels) in March, up 0.4% YoY; 96.5%

came from the Middle East.


Tokyo Gas to buy back ¥113 billion in shares, the company’s largest ever
(Nikkei, April 26)
•  Tokyo Gas will spend up to ¥113 billion to repurchase 12.2% of its shares, the largest buyback in

its history.
•  Its consolidated FY2022 results increased almost three-fold, YoY, to ¥281 billion, a record high for
the past 7 years. Sales rose 53% to ¥3.3 trillion.
•  Margins for FY2022 increased thanks to rising LNG prices, which the company buys under long-
term contracts with stable prices.
•  CONTEXT: High profits were also due to the weak yen, but this year the company expects lower
LNG demand with sales expected to decline 12% to ¥2.9 trillion. Profits are expected to drop 64%

to ¥100 billion.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Will a Stronger Regulator Emerge in Japan’s Power and Gas Sector?

Recent scandals over cartel behavior in Japan’s power market have sent shockwaves across
the energy sector. Authorities spent the past few months investigating what exactly has
transpired and the results are grim, revealing illegal practices that go back to 2016 – the
year that the markets were fully liberalized.

In response, a wave of indignation has led to calls for major reforms in the power sector.

Official probes found that major power utilities were illicitly accessing customer data of
other generators. Also, it seems that Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric, Kyushu Electric,
Chubu Electric Power Miraiz, and Kyuden Mirai Energy had agreed in 2018 to restrain
competition in the high-voltage market, which covers business users. In response, the
Japan Fair Trade Commission has levied penalties totaling ¥101 billion against the firms.

At first glance, this scandal couldn’t have come at a worse time. The government is
launching its much vaunted GX program to entirely overhaul the national energy system in
line with global efforts to transition to clean energy. It wants and needs the country’s
biggest power providers to invest large sums in boosting non-fossil energy volumes.
However, as Churchill once said: “Never let a crisis go to waste”. This scandal is giving the
reformers among government and bureaucracy circles an opportunity to push for even
deeper changes than the 2016 liberalization. For example, there's a growing momentum
behind the idea that former regional power monopolies, the EPCOs, should be forced to
fully separate their generation, transmission and retail units to guarantee a level playing
field. The fragility of EPCOs’ current arrangement has been exposed.


More power to the EGC?
While the full liberalization of the power sector in 2016 and of the gas sector in 2017 led to
the unbundling of EPCOs, most of these major power utilities simply formed a new holding
company to manage their legacy generation, transmission and other assets.

In theory, the integrity of each business unit is protected by Chinese walls. In reality, what
Japanese officials found was that staff from one division of an EPCO had access to data
from another.

During discussions with industry over how to revise market rules in line with the shift to
non-fossil generation, government officials discovered that some EPCO staff had regular
access to the govt database of renewable energy operators, including privacy data. What’s
more, these staff stand accused of passing the data to the retail businesses that sit within
the same EPCO group or holding.
The data on renewables operators was stored in a METI database, access to which was
guarded by select logins. However, in one case, it was found that one ID and password
issued by the government to an EPCO was shared by up to 50 people inside the groups.

Oversight of the industry is conducted by the Electricity and Gas Markets Surveillance
Commission (EGC), which falls under the METI umbrella. Upon the discovery of the
irregularities, the regulator simply asked the EPCOs to report back with improvement
17

plans. Such a response was criticized by many as soft and entirely inappropriate when
dealing with criminal conduct such as unauthorized data access and data breach.

In some ways, it evoked memories of the kind of cozy relationships that the previous
nuclear industry regulator enjoyed with nuclear generators prior to the Fukushima accident.

So, it is no surprise that calls for a stronger regulatory body, or an EGC with more teeth,
have come to the fore.


It’s complicated
Some officials say that the main problem lies in IT security rather than regulatory systems.
One government panel consisting of IT security experts, for example, said that METI was
not following the government's own cyber security rules in administering its database. The
EGC consequently recommended that METI change its ID and password policies and that
by 2026 all the customer data systems within EPCOs are fully separated.
The regulator also asked that EPCOs conduct compliance staff training and disclose
progress of corrective actions. But behind the veneer of IT trouble and compliance gaffs
lies a more complicated situation.

EGC as a regulator has little coercive power. The EGC is a “soft regulator” classified as an
“Article 8 commission”, which means it can only provide advice to the state minister, and
issue non-binding advisories and guidance to companies. It can’t enforce decisions.

In contrast, other agencies are classified as Article 3 commissions, which means they can
issue orders to companies and impose penalties if non-compliant. The Japan Fair Trade
Commission (JFTC) is just such a group.

On March 2, the Cabinet Taskforce to Review Renewable Regulations submitted a
proposal to improve regulatory enforcement in the power sector. The main measures are:
1) To probe EPCO non-compliance back to 2016 to measure the costs of regulatory failure;
2) To penalize offenders by taking away their licenses, while the government facilitates a
smooth transition to a second service provider; and 3) to empower the EGC with the
required authority to implement these measures.

The four panelists were Hatta Tatsuo, the inaugural EGC chairman; Prof. Takahashi Hiroshi
of Hosei University; Obayashi Mika of the Renewable Energy Institute (REI); and Kawamoto
Akira of Aspirant Group. Hatta told the taskforce that EPCOs have an attitude: they “well
know that their licenses will never be taken away and they can get away with anything.”
The panelists proposed elevating the EGC to an Article 3 Commission, giving it teeth to
bite and not just engage in advisory.
The EGC’s independence from METI was also questioned, as it was forced to probe a data
breach case that involved the ministry’s own data system.

Wanted: Experienced professionals
For any reform to succeed, one critical area will be to build capable teams of experienced
and motivated experts, one former EGC official told Japan NRG. The four members of the
Cabinet Taskforce to Review Renewable Regulations also proposed to make EGC’s current
part-time chairman and four commissioners full-time officials.

For the sake of independence, the regulator will also need to limit the number of METI and
ANRE staff it takes in. EGC’s Tokyo head office has 77 staff, of which 40 are temporary
transfers from METI and ANRE; they usually return to their original ministry after two years.

“If more people from the JFTC joined the EGC it will make a world of difference,” Prof.
Takahashi Hiroshi told Japan NRG. Presently, the head of the market surveillance unit is an
official from the JFTC.
Takahashi and others hope that the increased number of JFTC officials taking EGC
positions will improve its effectiveness. The antitrust watchdog was the one that exposed
the non-compliant practices of the EPCOs, not just the cartel but potential infringements in
wholesale trade and power generation units. On March 30, the EGC took over the non-
cartel investigation from the JFTC.

Give supervisory authority to impose orders and penalties by amending the Electricity
Increase authority
Business Act.
Make chairman and four commissioners full time positions; Recruit more staff but
Increase staffing
decrease staff from METI and ANRE.
But hiring entirely from outside of METI in the name of independence would not work
either, says the former EGC official. Market surveillance is a niche skill and antitrust officials
that arrived at the power industry regulator in the past had to start from scratch when it
came to understanding how the sector operates.
Since EGC cannot hire people from the power companies to avoid a conflict of interest,
taking in some staff from METI makes sense, the former EGC official said. METI people can
provide sector experience and balance in decision-making. Completely separating the
EGC from METI in the name of independence is like running a computer without software,
he said.


Complete separation?
The EGC has three units: one to monitor power and gas markets, another to monitor
networks, and a policy coordination unit. Compared to the UK’s Office of Gas and
Electricity Markets (OFGEM) EGC’s role is quite limited.

Some observers say the EGC should monitor the effectiveness of government policies in
addition to market compliance. ANRE/ METI should focus on policy making; while
everything else, including licensing, should shift to the EGC. But not everything could be
split clearly between them.

The JFTC is the most relevant authority to write competition rules. METI and ANRE policy
makers are more focused on breaking up the EPCOs, seen as a fast track approach to
creating a level playing field by weakening their market power, building on the “partial”
unbundling that the former monopolies achieved by packaging the assets inside holding
companies or group structures.
On April 28, METI announced its plan to amend the Electricity Business Act to raise
penalties for non compliance. In June, the Cabinet is expected to come up with a proposal
to improve regulatory practices. Prime Minister Kishida’s popularity has been on the rise in
recent months and he may be able to expend some political capital to push for strong
industry reforms, especially if it will be seen as a boon to his GX initiative.

However, it would be risky to bet against the EPCOs. They are the great survivors and
stalwarts of Japan’s electricity system with strong influence in the media, among big
business lobby groups and beyond. PM Kishida’s government will need to decide whether
this is a hill on which it wants to take a stand or accept another mid-way solution that
papers over the cracks in competition.

ENERGY       JOBS   IN  JAPAN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Salary Trends Across Japan’s Energy Sector
For many years, the energy industry had certain perceptions about salary. That oil &
gas pays higher than renewables; that multinational companies pay higher than the
Japanese firms; that large corporations are the best paying players in the market.

As the energy industry transitions and diversifies, subsidies and large-scale investment
have flowed into new technologies across renewable generation, grid flexibility and
next-generation mobility, resulting in a shift in the salary and power balance.

Do Japanese companies pay less, and does oil & gas pay more?
The answer is not so simple. We need to look into the value of the whole package,
not only taking into account the cash (base + bonus) portion of a salary package.
Typically, large Japanese firms do pay a lower cash portion than their foreign
counterparts, and often oil and gas majors are competitive with global renewable
energy firms.

Looking at the benefits offered and understanding their value is key when assessing
the true total package. A few common benefits are listed below:

• Housing allowance. Junior staff often live in company-provided dormitories, and
housing allowances of a certain percentage are paid to higher-ranking employees.
As this allowance is paid pre-tax, the savings can be significant for the employee.
• Retirement allowance (tiashokukin). Often, retirement benefits are tied to length
of service in Japanese firms. Especially in cases where an employee has spent
their whole career with one firm and is in their 40s or 50s, the difference between
their payouts if they leave the company, or remain and retire there, can be in the
tens of millions of yen.
• Employee stock plans. Not limited to Japanese companies, stock plans are
sometimes overlooked and their true value not understood. Depending on the
company, these may come in the form of RSU (restricted stock units) that will vest
over a period of time, or stock options that are harder to assess, especially in pre-
IPO companies.
• Flights, benefit station, allowances, etc. For someone who travels internationally
on a regular basis, the difference between business and economy class flights can
be significant. Corporate tie-ups and partnerships with company getaways (besso)
or discounts on restaurants, hotels etc, through plans such as benefit stations add
some, though generally not significant value to a total package.


Risk vs reward
As energy technologies have developed, investment has diversified and players have
globalized. There’s now a wide range of options for professionals to choose from. We
tend to see a clearer correlation between risk and reward, compared to Japanese vs
multinational, for example.

Size matters
Though many Japanese see foreign capital firms as inherently risky, the truth is that
well-known foreign names such as the oil and gas majors, as well as power utilities,
21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

have become desirable employers, and they have a long-term view of the Japanese
market. This has resulted in such large foreign firms having a lower risk profile and
means that they tend to pay in line with, or modestly more than, domestic
counterparts of similar standing in the industry. However, no one is doubling their
salary moving from a major trading house to a multinational power utility.

Put your money where your mouth is
Developers backed by private equity are increasingly prevalent in the market.
Typically, they take on more risk, get involved in projects at an earlier stage, keep
leaner teams where each employee’s work is clearly visible to management. The
mandate of these funds is to turn a profit; therefore, in a down market the risk of
downsizing or leaving is certainly higher. These firms often pay for performance,
giving a higher base salary, as well as a lucrative bonus, profit sharing, carried interest,
etc. Not only choosing the company’s size, but also choosing the timing to join can
have a significant effect on the offer given to a new employee. Similar to tech startups
in the U.S., those joining earlier bear greater risk, bring bigger impact to the firm and
are rewarded in line with this.

In-demand talent and transferable skills
Supply vs demand is basic economics, and in the energy transition there are windows
of opportunity for professionals who have experience or widely desired skills.
Experience in bidding for an offshore wind project, or structuring and negotiating an
offsite corporate PPA, are examples of this. Often, those who hold the in-demand
experience are in a position to gain multiple offers, and command negotiation power
to increase the value of offers. Both companies looking to attract such talent, and
firms who seek to retain their top performers, need to be aware of this trend, as
increases of 20-40% are not uncommon.

Naturally, in a growth market, there’s not enough experienced talent to fill all open
positions. Companies will often hire talent they see as high-potential, without the
required experience, but who have a strong base of transferable skills. Engineering,
project management and building supply chains for wind or battery projects are
common examples. In these cases, the employer needs to invest significant time,
energy and resources into upskilling, often including business trips to HQ or regional
project sites. In these cases, the onus is often on the employee to understand the
value that the new skills will bring them. Ambitious employees may then accept a
smaller pay increase or even a small drop in their overall remuneration in order to take
this chance and acquire the valuable skills.

Case A: Combining risk vs reward and in-demand talent scenarios. Titan introduced a
Head of Engineering with over six years of directly relevant experience to an
investment driven development platform as one of their original members. The
employee was leaving a stable Japanese organization with a sizable operational
portfolio. His offer was a 60% increase in base salary, as well as access to potentially
lucrative profit-sharing opportunities.

Case B: Investing in future development. In another case, Titan introduced a young,
high potential professional for a senior role that would lead commercial, contract and
PPA negotiations for a well-known developer with an excellent track record and
training capabilities. Though the employee didn’t have direct experience with such
contracts, he demonstrated agility, adaptability and willingness to learn. He

22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

understood the value of the skills and experience he’d gain by taking on the role, and
made the move without an increase.

Salary benchmarking or value-based offers
What are they making now vs what value do they bring? These two significantly
different questions are asked when companies consider their budget or how to make
an offer. This tends to correlate with risk vs reward, or size and complexity of the
organization.

Large, publicly-traded companies will typically set a budget range prior to beginning
a search, and when identifying talent at the lower end of the range, they often pay a
menial increase that doesn’t touch their budget ceiling. The basic idea tends to
revolve around the candidate’s current salary level, and how it compares to those
already in the team (internal equity).

On the other hand, smaller, leaner, result-driven firms give a wide budget range, or
ask their agency partner to provide typical ranges. Rather than excluding candidates
who exceed their ideal range, they’ll typically meet the candidate and try to
understand what additional value that person can bring. The position may be
widened, scope changed, and budget increased to accommodate such talent. Often,
large increases are seen here, where previously undervalued talent are given a chance
to show what they are worth.

It’s difficult to say which approach is better, as each organization has different needs,
internal resources and benefits for those who decide to join. As with assessing the
package value mentioned above, much more than simply cash compensation must be
considered by both the employer and employee when it comes to number crunching
time.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

California/ Diesel truck ban
California became the first U.S. state to approve regulation to end diesel truck sales
by 2036. By 2045 the governor's plan calls for all trucks on the road to reach zero
emissions.

Denmark/ Energy island
Shell joined the VindØ Energy Island Consortium that will be connected to 10 GW of
offshore wind in order to power Denmark and neighboring countries. Located about
100 km off Denmark’s west coast, the project will be the world’s first energy island.

Europe/ Biofuels
Global incentives to slash fossil fuels have inflated biofuels demand, but feedstocks
are in short supply, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste products. This has
led to much fraudulent biofuel on sale, warns the European Biodiesel Board,
especially from China.

France/ Climate lawsuit
TotalEnergies has sued Greenpeace France and climate consultants Factor-X over a
2019 report claiming that the energy company underestimated its emissions to 455
million tons of CO2. Greenpeace alleged that Total’s emissions were 1.6 billion tons
of CO2.
North Sea/ Oil and gas
Spain’s Repsol agreed with China’s Sinopec to resolve an 8-year dispute over North
Sea oil and gas assets. Repsol paid $2.1 billion to acquire Sinopec’s 49% stake in their
JV.

Norway/ Gas exploration
The Petroleum and Energy Minister called on oil and gas companies to fulfill their
“social responsibility” to find more natural gas resources in the Barents Sea. Norway
wants more oil and gas to boost energy security and help EU partners.

Nuclear Power/ SMRs
Westinghouse unveiled plans for a small modular reactor (SMR) called AP300 (300
MW capacity), which won’t use special fuels or liquid metal coolants, unlike some
other next-gen reactors. Work on the reactors begins by 2030. The company sees
Africa as a major market.

Scotland/ Energy transition
Cerulean Winds plans to build the North Sea Renewables Grid, an offshore integrated
power and transmission system powered by floating wind that oil and gas platforms
can plug into. The £20 billion project will develop three sites of hundreds of floating
turbines to produce many GW of electricity.

U.S./ Climate aid
The White House made a $1 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund, a major
international climate aid program. Biden also pledged to approve $500 million over
five years to combat rainforest deforestation through Brazil’s Amazon Fund program.

U.S./ Hydrogen power
Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and eight companies applied for $1.25 billion
from the Department of Energy to build the Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub that
will produce “green” and “blue” hydrogen. The federal govt has earmarked about $8
billion for hydrogen hub projects.

U.S./ LNG
The White House formally approved Alaska LNG, a $39 billion project that will export
natural gas to Asian markets. The project is touted as the only major new LNG project
in the U.S. that has so far secured all its permits and an export license.
