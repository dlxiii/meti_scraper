Development Bank of Japan to raise ESG financing 80% to $50B

(Asia Nikkei, May 20)
•  State-backed Development Bank of Japan will be raising the financing it allocates to
environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) projects to ¥5.5 trillion (about $50 billion)
over the next five years.
•  That means the bank will allocate about 40% of its investments and lending to ESG projects in the
period to FY2025. That’s a jump of as much as 80% from previous years.
•  The bank’s role will be to support the introduction and popularization of new energy technologies,

including in hydrogen, electric vehicles and tech to cut emissions. Equally, the financing will go to
companies that are changing their business models as a consequence of the energy transition and
the COVID pandemic.



Kansai Electric says nuclear stations will power hydrogen production

(Nikkei, May 21)
•  Kansai Electric Chairman Sakakibara said he the utility will seek to produce hydrogen using
electricity and heat from nuclear generation. The hydrogen can then be used as fuel at the
company’s thermal power plants. This is part of the utility’s strategy to decarbonize by 2050, he
said.
•  Kansai Electric hopes to become a leader in hydrogen utilization, he said. It hopes to work with
Iwatani Corp, which is one of the leaders in hydrogen production equipment.
•  KEPCO is also involved in the power generation business overseas, and "it is possible to make

hydrogen overseas and import it to Japan. I would like to create a business model with a newly
established organization in charge of hydrogen as the center."
•  The power utility has no concrete plans to build new nuclear plants, but Sakakibara said he
supported the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and other new nuclear tech to make
sure older plants are replaced and nuclear stays part of the national energy policy.




Panel votes against making solar rooftops compulsory, challenging the MoE
(Energy Shift, May 19)
•  A government panel looking at the proposal to make rooftop solar mandatory voted against.,
dealing a blow to Environment Minister Koizumi who has championed the idea as a way to raise
the renewables component in Japan.
•  At least eight of 13 members of the Study Group on Energy Saving Measures for Houses and

Buildings for a Carbon-Decarbonized Society, which is part of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism, declined to support the idea. Only three experts expressed their support.
•  Experts noted that not all areas of the country have equal sunlight potential and snow cover is an
issue. In addition, experts feared that some grid operators would struggle with balancing of their
system. Chugoku Electric and Shikoku Electric would face the hardest task with a need for
widespread curtailments.

power generation, and storage batteries as a CO2-free electricity source. The system would be
offered to companies by FY2023.
•  The system will charge fuel cells and batteries with sun power when the weather is good and utilize

the former sources at night and during bad weather, compensating for the intermittent nature of
solar PV.
•  Panasonic will reduce prices for the system by utilizing current tech that is already used to extract
hydrogen from city gas to generate electricity. It will compete against Toshiba and overseas
companies.

Industry group calls for more non-FIT renewable energy options
(Kankyo Business, May 14)
•  In a submission to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Japan Climate Leaders’
Partnership, which represents around 180 corporate members, has called for more options for

those purchasing renewable energy but not utilizing the Feed-In-Tariff scheme.
•  The group says they want to be able to sign long-term, virtual power purchase agreements directly
with power producers, and that currently, systemic obstacles make it difficult to enter into such
agreements.




J Power and Green Earth Institute mull Malaysian biofuels venture
(New Energy Business News, May 17)
•  J-Power and the Green Earth Institute may begin using waste timber from Malaysian palm oil
plantations as a source of fuel and chemicals.
•  Currently, Malaysia’s palm oil plantations send waste timber from felled palms to landfill. However,
these trees have a high sugar and moisture content, and inappropriate disposal can lead to the
production of greenhouse gases.

•  J-Power and the Green Earth Institute propose fermenting sap extracted from the waste timber so
that it can be refined into useful compounds. Residual wood tissue could then be converted into
biomass pellets for use in thermal power stations.



The race is on to create carbon-neutral tire

Japan may restrict foreign equipment use in power grids after U.S. pipeline attack
(Asia Nikkei, May 18)
•  Japan’s govt. plans to add regulations that would restrict foreign suppliers of equipment to 14 key
infrastructure fields, including electricity, after the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline in the U.S.
•  The government will ask operators of such infrastructure to consider national security issues when

procuring foreign-made equipment. This will include considering how data from the equipment is
stored, cloud server connections, and more.
•  The government will monitor companies for compliance and will suspend or cancel their license
should any major issues arise.
•  Current rules only ask government agencies not to purchase equipment that might carry national
economic security risk.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s concern stems from data leaking via Chinese-made equipment, although the Colonial

Pipeline is not seen as being related to China. Still, how these restrictions will impact on foreign firms seeking
to do business in smart grids, VPPs, and even main grid updates related to renewable energy is as yet unclear.
If new regulations are too tight, they will be seen as protectionist and a “favor” to domestic companies such as
NTT Group.




SoftBank sells India renewables business to Adani Green Energy in $3.5B deal
(Various media, May 20)
•  SoftBank agreed to sell its SB Energy India business, a JV between the Japanese investment group
and Bharti Enterprises, to local tycoon Gautam Adani’s green energy group in a deal valued at
$3.5 billion.
•  This is one of the biggest cross-border deals in renewable energy and among the top deals
involving Japan and India. The value includes $2.9 billion in debt and liabilities, such as pending

CAPEX, according to The Economic Times.

•  The newspaper estimates that SoftBank and Bharti will be exiting the business at a loss. Last year,
the two valued the business, which has 4,954 MW of operating capacity, at $1.2 billion.
•  The buyer, Adani Green Energy, will expand its portfolio to 10 GW, with 15 GW more under
construction, making it one of the largest global players in renewables.
•  SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, grew the Indian business in solar and wind but has struggled to

unlock the values it sought. All SB Energy projects have 25 year PPAs with sovereign rated
counterparties.
•  SoftBank turned down an earlier offer for SB Energy from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
It promised a higher valuation but that was for only 80% of the company.
•  CONTEXT: This sale is unrelated to SB Energy Corp, which is a separate entity pursuing renewable
energy projects in Japan and Mongolia, and also owned by SoftBank.
• TAKEAWAY: Cross-border deals into energy projects in developing markets can be complex and can struggle

to be profitable as financial incentives are ramped down and economies of scale max out. There are issues
unique to SoftBank also as the holding company has activist investors who are forcing Masayoshi Son to
streamline his asset portfolio. Details emerged last week that SoftBank may sell down its entire remaining stake
in T-Mobile, valued at $14 billion, to Deutsche Telekom in a major reversal of its global telecoms strategy. Son
is expected to focus his investments exclusively on technology-related sectors. This raises the question of what
happens to the Japanese SB Energy company in the mid to longer term.




Utilities forecast power outages in Tokyo from 2022 without nuclear online
(Shukan Economist, May 17)
•  Power utilities are worried that a shortage of electricity may force scheduled power outages in
greater Tokyo in early 2022.
•  According to a report published in March by the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of

Transmission Operators, electricity consumption in the area served by TEPCO is projected to
outstrip supply by over 1% in January and over 2% in February.
•  The situation is not much better in central and western Japan, where buffer capacity has now fallen
below the 3% deemed necessary to survive unusually cold weather.
•  The main reason for the nationwide shortage of electricity is the 13 GW reduction in electricity
generated by nuclear plants due to maintenance.




Renewable energy provided up to 88% of power in Tohoku area during holidays: Utility
(Kankyo Business, May 19)
•  The rate of electricity supplied from renewable energy sources jumped to 87.8% between 11am
and noon on May 4, during the Golden Week holidays, Tohoku Power Grid reported.
•  The grid operator said there were days during the holidays when power supply from renewable

energy facilities was very high. The operator had to work hard to avoid curtailments and instead
took some thermal power capacity offline while also relying on pumped storage during peak hours.
•  Tohoku’s solar output was 8% higher and wind output more than double that of a year earlier in
the same period, the grid company said.
•  Tohoku Grid vowed to continue trying to include as much renewable power in the total supply as
possible going forward.

11


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: Forget that the peak is only for an hour on one specific day, the big news here is that Tohoku
managed to avoid curtailments for solar and wind power operators in the area. As described in the Analysis
piece in last week’s Japan NRG, in areas such as Kyushu renewables operators see output curtailed at least
once a week. If Tohoku is able to regulate thermal capacity more flexibly outside of the holiday period, this
could mark a major shift in Japan’s power mix. Of course, one caveat in this case is that Tohoku has a lot of

hydro power, and some of what it terms “thermal” is actually biomass and geothermal.



Kansai Electric begins loading fuel into Mihama NPP Unit 3, start seen in June
(Tokyo Shimbun, Kyodo News, May 23)
•  On May 20, Kansai Electric began loading fuel into Unit 3 reactor at the Mihama nuclear power

plant (NPP). A total of 157 fuel rods were inserted into the reactor by May 23.
•  The reactor has not been fueled since May 2011.
•  The utility aims to start operations on June 23. It will be Japan’s first reactor to be restarted that is
older than 40 years. Commercial operations would then be achieved around July 27.
•  The unit is one of several to receive a 20-year service life extension from the industry.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kansai Electric finishes loading fuel into Takahama NPP Unit 1

(Denki Shimbun, May 18)
• TAKEAWAY: Japan faces a shortage of power capacity this summer, which is expected to be hotter than usual,
according to the major utilities. While the restart of nuclear power is not a popular option in Japan, the greater
concerns around the pandemic and the Olympic Games have taken nuclear power off the top news agenda.
That’s possibly helped utilities that are keen to move quicky with restarts of nuclear reactors. Should the
summer really turn into an energy emergency, and the restarts of reactors go smoothly, the utilities will win

back some support for the sector. However, nothing has been easy for Japan’s nuclear industry in recent years
and there are still many IFs.




Offshore wind tenders: Orsted throws hat into ring in Akita region projects
(Kensetsu Tsushin Shimbun, May 21)
•  Denmark-based Orsted, the world’s largest operator of offshore wind turbines, says it has
submitted bids in tenders to build wind farms off the coast of Akita, in conjunction with Japan
Wind Development and Eurus Energy Holdings.
•  Japan Wind Development has been assessing wind conditions, surveying the seafloor, and
performing environmental assessments in the area since 2017.

•  The wind farm proposed for the sea off Noto, Mitane, and Oga will have a nameplate capacity of
415 MW, while that located off Yurihonjo will have a capacity of 730 MW.
•  Tenders close on May 27, and the successful contract will be announced in October.

TEPCO Energy Partner enters adjustment market with VPP, storage battery

(Denki Shimbun, May 19)
•  TEPCO Energy Partner (EP) has entered the supply-demand adjustment market using its VPP
(Virtual power plant) and 1 MW storage battery in Ibaraki prefecture.
•  The company says it’s the first time in Japan that a VPP is being utilized in the supply-demand
adjustment market. A VPP used the customers’ own resources to regulate supply to meet demand.
•  TEPCO EP has secured 1 MW of adjustment power from a NAS (sodium sulphur) battery installed

at Mitsubishi Materials Tsukuba Works, in Joso City, Ibaraki.
•  TEPCO EP has experience with regulating about 10 MW of storage battery capacity on the
customer side as a Demand Response (DR) mechanism. The company hopes to have access to the
same kind of battery capacity to make adjustments, but will start with a smaller 1 MW facility
before gradually ramping up.




Japanese energy startup latest victim of power price peak – files for bankruptcy
(Mainichi Shimbun, May 18)
•  Panair, a Tokyo-based energy venture that aimed to build a cloud-based operating system, filed
for bankruptcy protection from creditors under the Civil Rehabilitation Act.
•  The startup has debt of about ¥6 billion in part due to being caught out in the power wholesale
market, which saw prices hit a sudden spike in January.
• TAKEAWAY: Panair is only the third firm widely reported as going bankrupt after the January price spike, but

more electricity retailers are expected to seek court protection in the coming month as their bills to the grid
operators become due.

Japan’s oil refiners vow to speed up asset sales in light of the decarbonization trend
(Reuters, May 17)
•  Oil refining major Idemitsu now sees Japanese fossil fuel demand contracting 30% by 2030, more
than the previously estimated 20%, compared with 2019.
•  Idemitsu will focus on low-carbon fuels such as ammonia and plant-derived black pellets, which are

advanced wood pellets that can be used in place of coal. It will also pursue renewable energy
projects, including geothermal and biomass.
•  Rival ENEOS will also scale down upstream oil assets, but could raise its stake in the downstream
by buying more of Vietnam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex), as well as expanding gas
operations in Southeast Asia.
•  ENEOS is building out a clean energy value chain by working in renewables, storage batteries and

EVs. The company is also interested in expanding the hydrogen and synthetic fuels business.



Japan fuel sales drop 8% in Fiscal 2020 due to the pandemic
(Sekiyu Tsushin, May 18)
•  Based on financial results of the three oil refining majors in Japan (ENEOS, Idemitsu, and Cosmo

Energy), fuel oil sales in fiscal 2020 (April 2020 to March 2021) were down 8% to 110,108 kl.
•  Gasoline demand dropped 8.33%.
•  Naphtha sales dropped 15.2%, also due to the chips supply shortage that has hampered
automobile production.
•  Jet fuel oil sales dropped 46.2% as air travel was severely restricted.
•  Kerosene was up 0.9% due to winter heating, but heating demand is expected to be volatile in the
coming years and switching to cleaner fuels will restrict total demand.
•  Diesel oil was down 5.0%, partly due to a sharp drop in tourist activity and bus demand.

•  Exports plunged 50.2% as the pandemic restricted overseas demand and also the operation of
refineries.

The Fate of Japan’s Decarbonization Largely Rests With JERA:
Japan’s LNG King Tries Pivot to Ammonia and Offshore Wind

The fate of Japan’s recently-announced and ambitious decarbonization pledge will in
large part depend on the future course determined by the country’s largest utility,
JERA. The company is a vast network of fossil fuel assets and trading, and the world’s
No.1 importer of LNG. If such a colossus of old-energy can make a drastic transition to
clean energy, then Japan has a chance.

About 10% of Japan’s CO2 emissions can be traced to JERA. The company operates
more than two dozen thermal power stations with 70 GW of capacity, equivalent to
one-third of Japan’s total.

Despite such an entrenched fossil fuel asset base, JERA has pledged to embrace the
clean energy revolution. The company says it is betting big on ammonia and
hydrogen, and has strong ambitions in offshore wind.

JERA’s influence on Japan’s national energy strategy is unmistakable. Last October,
JERA took center stage when it unveiled a strategy toward zero CO2 emissions by
2050. Two weeks later, Prime Minister Suga made the national pledge to achieve
decarbonization by mid-century. A JERA executive admitted to Japan NRG that the
company exchanged views with the government agencies beforehand.

Both JERA and the government identify hydrogen and offshore wind as the essential
pillars of the zero-emission goals. Inspired by JERA’s strategy, Kansai Electric Power
Co. and Chugoku Electric Power Co. in February also announced plans to promote
the use of ammonia to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions. As a reference, METI
has projected that 10% of power generation will use hydrogen and ammonia in 2050.


Unique ammonia and hydrogen Solutions
JERA says a pilot project on co-firing of ammonia with coal will begin at Hekinan
Thermal Power Plant in Aichi prefecture starting this fiscal year. The company expects
the co-firing rate to hit 20% at all its coal plants by the first half of the 2030s, followed
by the operation of solo ammonia firing in the 2040s.

Ammonia, rather than hydrogen, is seen as more promising in the medium-term
transition period, as the former is commonly used, often as fertilizer, and already
internationally traded. According to JERA’s calculation, it would eventually need
500,000 tons of ammonia per plant annually, which is roughly equivalent to half of the
amount Japan currently imports every year. The government recently set a target of
using 3 million tons of ammonia fuel per year by 2030.

Hydrogen, which needs to be transported below -252.87 °C, is nowhere close to that.
Japan and Australia just launched the world’s first Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain
(HESC) project in February 2021.

Given this reality, JERA plans to wait for the full-scale operation of the co-firing of gas
and hydrogen at its LNG power plants until the 2030s.

If this co-firing blueprint goes successful, this unique solution pursued by Japan may
come in handy for many thermal power-dependent Asian economies, which tend to
grow faster with poor geographical and climate conditions for renewable energy.
Indeed, JERA’s official mission is “to establish new energy supply models for Japan”
while also offering these models to “other countries” with similar challenges.

A JERA executive told Japan NRG that the company may be able to contribute to
countries with progressive eco-policy policies such as Vietnam and Bangladesh,
“helping them not just for a project but as a portfolio”.

JERA said in February that it signed an MOU with Petronas, a Malaysian state-owned
oil and natural gas company, to cooperate in the production and supply of ammonia
and hydrogen fuels. The Malaysian company is currently producing about 2 million
tons of ammonia per year. More specifically, JERA aims to produce green ammonia
using electricity from hydroelectric power generation in Malaysia and import it to
Japan.

Furthermore, this month, JERA announced that it signed another MOU with Yara
International, a Norwegian fertilizer company and one of the world’s largest ammonia
producers, to cooperate in the ammonia value chain business, including the
development of a blue ammonia production plant. Yara produces ammonia from
natural gas at its Pilbara Fertilizer plant in Australia, and both firms will work together
to improve the process by potentially adopting CCS. The two reportedly also are
considering to build new plants overseas.


Ready for offshore wind big bang at home
The Tokyo-headquartered company endeavors to rocket-start its renewable business
to be recognized as a serious player in the sector. JERA aims to expand the size of its
installed capacity of renewable energy from the current 1.1GW to 5GW by 2025. It
has acquired 10% stake in India’s leading renewable energy firm, ReNew Power.

In particular, JERA is betting on the offshore wind business, and the company
invested in three offshore wind power projects in Taiwan, namely, Formosa 1 through
3. Located in the Taiwan Straits, these three sites are under similar geographical and
climate conditions to sea areas off Akita’s coasts in Northern Japan, a up-and-coming
hub of the country’s offshore wind business.

The company is set to apply the acquired know-how for projects in Japan. JERA,
together with Norwegian energy company Equinor ASA and J-Power, is preparing to
bid for offshore wind power projects in Akita prefecture and opened its Akita branch
in April to collect relevant information.

In March, JERA revealed a plan for an offshore wind farm, consisting of about 63 wind
turbines, off the coast of Aomori prefecture. The maximum output is expected to
reach 0.6 GW.

This month, JERA hired offshore wind specialist Nathalie Oosterlinck from Belgium’s
offshore marine engineering firm DEME to be its senior operating officer in

17

renewables. Oosterlinck is due to move to Japan this year and lead JERA’s global
offshore wind operations.

JERA has also moved to build a joint venture with French firms, including IDEOL, to
be technically ready for the installment of the next generation floating offshore wind
power stations that appear essential for Japan’s rapid offshore wind expansion.

JERA’s push is well aligned with the government's Green Growth Strategy unveiled by
Prime Minister Suga last December, and whereby Japan aims to expand the installed
capacity of offshore wind power to 10 GW by 2030 and up to 30-45 GW by 2040.

According to a JERA executive, to rapidly grow offshore capacity, the Japanese
government should minimize overlapping pre-project surveys among bidding
companies and allow early negotiations with local stakeholders so that "construction
can start the day after winning the bid.”

Considering its vast resources and political power, JERA is uniquely positioned to
decide the outcome of Japan’s effort to transition to clean energy in the coming
decades, including meeting goals for CO2 emissions cuts by 2030. Considering its
ambitious clean energy agenda, the country certainly has the will to forge ahead with
such plans.

Nevertheless, in the foreseeable future, no matter how noble its intentions, JERA’s
vast profits will still owe much to fossil fuels, especially LNG imports, and the company
might find it far too tempting to give up that cash cow so easily.

BY YURIY HUMBER

Two Views on the Strategy to Decarbonize:

IEA Calls for Superlatives, Japan Asks for Realism

In the last two weeks, Japan and the International Energy Agency (IEA) unveiled key
reports on routes to decarbonization. While the reports speak on similar issues and
technologies, each has quite different outlooks.

The IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 is a 224-page blueprint for an outright revolution, calling
an end to coal, oil and even natural gas use, as well as for investments of $5 trillion by
2030 to remake the world’s power system from top to bottom.

In contrast, Japan’s view on energy transition, published a week earlier, urges
pragmatism, incremental change, and cost-awareness. In six of the seven scenarios
presented by the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE),
which is Japan’s leading energy think tank, fossil fuels will retain at least a 20% share
of the electricity in 2050. Albeit, with the hope that carbon capture is also deployed.

Where the IEA casts renewables as the lynchpin of the global economy, accounting
for two-thirds of energy supply, RITE’s reference scenario for Japan has renewables at
just over half of the total by 2050.

Where the IEA paints extraordinary numbers for solar and wind capacity additions, the
views presented by RITE and other Japanese experts at the recent METI meeting on
decarbonization use extraordinary numbers to suggest that a total shift towards solar
and wind is not feasible in Japan.

Clearly, at least for now, the world’s top energy agency and one of the world’s top
energy consumers do not see eye to eye on the paths to net-zero.


Many ways from A to B
METI officials have been unusually curt when commenting on the IEA report, noting
that it provides but “one suggestion” on how to reduce emissions by 2050. Since
Japan also needs to think about energy security and power grid stability, fossil fuels
won’t be going away any time soon, said one top Japanese energy bureaucrat.

Such comments should come as no surprise after METI’s Basic Energy Subcommittee
meeting in the middle of this month, at which leading energy experts pooled their
calculations on various energy transition options for Japan.

The keynote was delivered by Akimoto Keigo, leader of the Systems Analysis Group
at RITE. (Please see Japan NRG Weekly from Dec. 7 and Dec. 14 for a detailed
directory of Who’s Who in Japan’s energy policy universe and which ministry
committees are involved in decarbonization discussions.)

Preparing the floor for Akimoto’s 71-page presentation, METI noted that RITE’s
analysis takes a broad look at various scenarios for Japan, including transforming its

19


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

entire energy system to renewables. The essence of such a broad approach is that it
contains many “uncertainties in terms of technological innovation, social
implementation, and so on.” This means, METI warned, that the findings are only
“drawing a picture” and should not be interpreted as final numbers.

METI also promised to regularly review and rethink its energy scenarios, a departure
from its past approach of giving definitive plans.

There was no such caution in IEA’s blueprint to 2050. The agency also acknowledged
that as much as half of the forecasted emission reductions are based on actions and
technologies that are either at a demonstration stage or yet to be invented. In some
sectors like hydrogen, the technology gaps are even higher.

Despite the uncertainties, the IEA set out very specific timelines, money and capacity
additions that it sees as necessary, and concrete actions the agency advocates for
both governments and citizens. (See table below)


Recommendations and Notes from IEA’s report, Net Zero by 2050

Solar        Annual additions of 630 GW of PV during this decade

Wind         Annual additions of 390 GW during this decade

The recommendations from the IEA discuss similar issues to those being debated by
the energy experts in Japan, but the conclusions in the energy complex of Asia’s No.
2 economy are quite different.


Recommendations and Notes from RITE’s report on moving Japan to net zero

•  RITE classifies thermal power with CCUS as a non-fossil-fuel energy source. Even in
case carbon capture is not practical or used, RITE claims fossil fuels will be offset by
negative emissions technology, making them “carbon-neutral”. The institute notes
that gas is likely to remain in the energy picture because not all industries will be easy

to electrify.

This stance is surely a way for Japan to retain LNG, and to a smaller degree oil, in the
energy picture for 2050 and beyond. The rationale is not only based on what is best
for a balanced grid and the costs of adopting more variable renewables. For Japanese
bureaucrats, sourcing oil and gas from diversified nations around the world is seen as
an issue of security and geopolitical tool.

•  RITE models seven different scenarios for Japan, one of which is the Reference case.
In that scenario: renewables account for 54% of the electricity mix, nuclear for 10%,
ammonia / hydrogen for 13%, and fossil fuels with CCUS for 23%. The table below is a
summary of the Reference case.

Energy Source        Percentage of the Mix Estimated Cost per kWh
¥10 - ¥17 (solar)
Renewables                54% (730 TWh)
¥11 - ¥20 (wind)
Nuclear                   10% (140 TWh)   ¥13

Hydrogen and ammonia      13% (180 TWh)   ¥16 - ¥27

¥13 - ¥16 (based on 90 million
Thermal power + CCUS      23% (310 TWh)   tons of CO2 stored in Japan
and 230 million tons exported)

TOTAL                      1,350 TWh      Ceiling price: ¥24.9



• Nuclear’s share is seen at 10% in nearly all scenarios. It is missing in the 100%
Renewables scenario, but that model is also painted as the most unrealistic and
unsuitable for Japan. According to a separate METI presentation, this 10% ratio is
based on:
o  All current reactors listed as operational (33 units) being brought back
online and the reactors currently listed as under construction (3) being
completed;
o  All 36 reactors having their 40-year license extended by 20 years, as has
already happened for a few of Kansai Electric’s units
o  This would see 23 units still operating in 2050, generating 166.3 billion
kWh of power, or 10% of the nation’s total
o  Without license extensions (but assuming that all reactors are brought
online and the three mid-construction are completed) nuclear will only
amount for 2% of Japan’s electricity in 2050

• Confidence in ammonia / hydrogen is high, but uncertainties are even higher. Their
role in the 2050 power mix is as low as 2% in two of RITE’s seven scenarios, and as
high as 23% in the Hydrogen Innovation pathway. Still, RITE concludes that whatever
scenario wins out, “significant amounts of hydrogen, ammonia and synthetic fuels will
be imported” to Japan.

|  | Energy Source |  |  | Percentage of the Mix |  |  | Estimated Cost per kWh |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Renewables |  |  | 54% (730 TWh) |  |  |  | ¥10 - ¥17 (solar) |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ¥11 - ¥20 (wind) |  |

| Hydrogen and ammonia |  |  | 13% (180 TWh) |  |  | ¥16 - ¥27 |  |  |
| Thermal power + CCUS |  |  | 23% (310 TWh) |  |  | ¥13 - ¥16 (based on 90 million
tons of CO2 stored in Japan
and 230 million tons exported) |  |  |
|  | TOTAL |  |  | 1,350 TWh |  |  | Ceiling price: ¥24.9 |  |

• Electrification will expand power demand by 20% to 40% in all scenarios other than
100% Renewables.

• Renewables will play a bigger role in Japan in any scenario. However, if their share
rises above the Reference case of 54%, the cost of systems integration will rise
sharply, raising power prices and hurting demand for electricity. The cost of more
power lines and other transmissions equipment could add ¥10 per kWh to electricity
prices.


Scenarios heavily depend on how you choose the inputs
Just as the IEA decarbonization report offers eye-popping figures, Japan’s analyses also
depend on many figures that could be questioned. For example:

o  RITE claims that the cost of building nuclear power facilities will be little
changed between 2020 and 2050.
o  The institute’s reference scenario for CCS sees the technology absorbing just
91 million tons of CO2 a year at its peak in 2050 – a capacity that would surely
struggle to accommodate the emissions from the remaining thermal power
stations that it also expects to be online at that time.

Still, as RITE and METI both point out in their presentations, these are best-effort
estimates for energy development as it is understood today, and they will form a basis for
discussions inside Japanese industry and government.

Where the IEA paints a picture of certainty for change, the Japanese decarbonization
roadmap offers an entirely different certainty – that every energy source, existing and
future, still has a chance to be part of 2050.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Nuclear Power:
1). Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated Karachi Unit 2 Nuclear Power
Reactor, a Chinese 1.1 GW Hualong unit (HPR1,000), operated by Pakistan Atomic
Energy Commission. The Karachi units are the first exports of China’s Hualong
technology and have an expected life of 60 years. Construction of Unit 2 began in
2015 and was connected to Pakistan’s grid in March. Karachi Unit 3 is expected to be
connected to the grid early in 2022. The Chinese Atomic Energy Authority is now
expecting nuclear cooperation between Pakistan and China “to reach new heights”.
2). Uranium prices are up 20% since the end of 2019, even though some mines in
Namibia and Canada have closed.

Nord Stream 2:
In a major U-turn, the U.S. is waiving sanctions on the operator of Nord Stream 2, the
Russian-German natural gas pipeline, at Germany’s request. Ukraine is objecting and
is demanding the sanctions be reinstated.

IEA:
In another major U-turn, the IEA is calling for a halt to all new oil and gas projects this
year if the global warming target of 1.5C is to be met, according to a new report. The
agency is also calling for investments of $5 trillion per annum in low-carbon tech,
double the current expenditure levels. Denmark is the only country so far that has
cancelled new oil and gas license sales. Oil prices fell by almost $5 a barrel last week.

G7/Coal:
The world’s seven largest advanced economies agreed to stop international financing
of coal projects that emit carbon by the end of 2021, and phase out such support for
all fossil fuels, to meet globally agreed climate change targets. In the G7 communique
the G7 nations - the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan - plus the
European Union said "international investments in unabated coal must stop now".

Energy Transition:
As part of its analysis of the global energy transition Norway’s Rystad Energy predicts
that “while 55% of the energy mix is currently traded on global markets – oil, coal and
LNG – by 2050 only about 15% will be traded due to a decline in fossil fuel demand
and the continued rise of renewable energy that is traded at local and regional levels.
Investments will shift almost completely to renewables, batteries and grid upgrades.
The transportation and industrial sectors will be almost fully decarbonized”.

This development could have a major negative impact on Japan’s trading companies
and the international oil and gas traders such as Trafigura.
Shipping:

Japan is now expected to establish an international rating system for fuel efficiency of
ocean-going ships sailing in international waters by 2023.

Natural Gas:
The new EU taxonomy on dirty fuels may re-classify natural gas as not climate friendly,
creating significant legacy asset issues for BP, Shell and other upstream investors.

Aviation:
Air France-KLM conducted it first long-haul flight from Montreal to Paris using a
sustainable aviation fuel mix of petroleum combined with a synthetic jet fuel derived
from cooking oil.

Carbon Offsets:
Sylvera Ltd., a UK company that analyses carbon offset arrangements, believes that
over half of the carbon offset arrangements fail to deliver, and 10% are junk.

Central Banks – Climate:
Ninety Central Banks, part of the Central Banks and Supervisory Network for Greening
the Financial System, that includes China, Russia, and Japan as well as Western
countries, will meet for the first time in June to discuss frameworks and capital charges
for dealing with climate-related financial risks.

Arctic Council:
U.S. Secretary of State Blinkin visited Iceland, Denmark and Greenland, stressing the
U.S. commitment to green technology and environmental preservation. Japan and
South Korea have observer status on the Arctic Council. The Arctic 21 network
claimed in a report issued last Monday that the Arctic region is “disintegrating”.

EVs:
Renault and Nissan expect to be among the first carmakers to sell one million EVs
annually using a standardized joint battery system. The initiative may be expanded to
Mitsubishi Motors.

China:
Daqo New Energy Corp, a Xinjiang-based poly-silicon maker for solar panels, has
initiated a campaign to avoid possible U.S. sanctions in connection with allegations of
the use of forced labor in Xinjiang. It will conduct a human rights audit of operations.

Taiwan:
1). Gogoro, the Taiwanese electric scooter vendor, will partner with Chinese firms
Dachangjiang Group and Yadea to market battery-sharing infrastructure across China.
2). Taiwan is facing its most serious water shortages in half a century that are causing
power blackouts.

India:
1). Suzuki, Toyota, Yamaha and Honda have halted all auto production in India
because of Covid-19.
2). Cyclone Tauktae displaced 150,000 people in Gujarat. It’s the worst cyclone to hit
India in two decades.
3). India is cancelling several LNG deliveries because of the impact of the pandemic.

Russia:
1). Polymetal, the Anglo-Russian precious metals mining company that operates in
Russia and Kazakhstan, will spend $850 million to cut emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is
