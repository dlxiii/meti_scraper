NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


METI says Japan should play key role in transition finance in Asia

(Government statement, June 10)
•  METI says that Japan can play a key role by assisting partner countries to align with their NDCs, and
help verify compatible technologies, and manage carbon risks.
•  The ministry also said the IEA sees Japan’s Climate Transition Bonds (JCTBs) as offering a model for
emerging economies to provide govt-backed credit support. However, more needs to be done to
improve general understanding of the value of transition finance and what partner countries should
expect.
•  CONTEXT: The IEA urges transition finance to integrate with sustainable finance frameworks. In 2024,
global energy investment likely exceeded $3 trillion. Two-thirds were for clean energy, though 85% was
in advanced economies and China.



GX-ETS to become mandatory for 300-400 high-emitting companies
(Denki Shimbun, June 9)
•  Japan’s emissions trading system (GX-ETS) will be mandatory in FY2026 for about 300-400
companies, those emitting over 100,000 tons of CO2 a year. These firms account for about 60% of
Japan’s GHGs.
•  Firms must match their emissions with govt-allocated allowances, traded in a market run by the GX
Promotion Organization.
•  A price ceiling/ floor will stabilize costs, and there will be fines for non-compliance. Additionally,
the govt will introduce a fossil fuel levy in FY2028.
•  CONTEXT: These moves are part of the amended GX (Green Transformation) Promotion Law. There are
concerns over double burdens (e.g., power sector costs), which will be the target of future legislation.



ANRE outlines plan to expand biofuel adoption

(Government statement, June 10)
•  ANRE drafted an action plan and policy to promote use of bioethanol in gasoline, so that it will have
up to 10% bioethanol by FY2030, aiming for up to 20% by FY2040.
•  A trial introduction in select regions by FY2028 will identify issues and support rapid expansion as
compatible vehicles become more common.



NTT Group demonstrates renewables-optimized distributed data centers
(Company statement, June 11)
•  NTT, NTT West and QTNet, a subsidiary of Kyushu Electric, demonstrated that IOWN’s All-
Photonics Network (APN) enables high-capacity, low-latency communication across geographically
dispersed data centers.
•  CONTEXT: The IOWN (Innovative Optical and Wireless Network) is an initiative for networks and
information processing infrastructure including terminals.

•  In a test between data centers in Fukuoka and Osaka (600 km apart), downtime during live
migration was reduced and renewable energy use improved by up to 31%. The firms say the test
proved that the tech allows optimal workload placement based on renewables availability.
•  NTT’s algorithm generated optimized workload plans within 2 minutes, enabling dynamic
processing shifts every 30 minutes based on real-time power conditions.



NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS



Tesla to expand VPPs across Japan to manage small-scale batteries
(Nikkei, June 13)
•  Tesla will launch a virtual power plant (VPP) business across Japan, managing small-scale batteries
collectively.
•  Batteries will be provided to businesses for free. They will be centrally controlled to charge during
periods of high renewables generation and discharge during peak electricity demand.
•  Tesla has partnered with Fukuoka-based Global Engineering and Fuyo Lease, aiming to install 100
units by FY2025. The program builds on a pilot in Okinawa.
•  This initiative lays the groundwork for Tesla’s vision of a “virtual power company” that aggregates
large numbers of batteries to supply power on demand.
•  Japan plans to promote VPPs by launching a system in FY2026 to help battery operators trade their
electricity. The balancing market will allow aggregated small-scale power sources to participate.
•  CONTEXT: VPP operators manage dispersed small-scale batteries in homes and offices to balance
regional electricity supply and demand. Batteries are charged during the day when solar power is
abundant and discharged during high-consumption periods like evenings.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s greater reliance on renewable energy sources like solar and wind requires more
deployment of batteries that can store and discharge power on demand to stabilise supply. Currently, the
government’s efforts are directed at larger battery projects and longer duration energy storage. Tesla sees a way
to achieve scale through aggregation and management of many small-scale units. Also, the company has started
its business in the Kyushu region, one of the worst for green power curtailments.



TOCOM  electricity futures trading down as hedging activity eases

(Exchange data, June 10)
•  TOCOM power derivatives trading slowed as forecasts for stability in the electricity supply demand
balance eased interest in hedging. Summer reserve margins are forecast by OCCTO at above 7%
across all regions even under severe heat scenarios.
•  TOCOM May trading volumes dropped sharply to 176.2 GWh (2,514 contracts) in May, down nearly
80% from April's 863.6 GWh (12,351 contracts).
•  Newly introduced annual contracts for FY2026 began trading on May 26, with initial deals executed
for East and West base-load products at ¥13.30/ kWh (East) and ¥11.35/ kWh (West).
•  May saw a total of 82 transactions, much lower than April's 393, impacted by holidays and Japan
Power Week events. Off-market (negotiated) transactions remained dominant – 69 of these deals –
including various trading periods such as summer, winter, and irregular durations tied to specific
retail contracts.
•  Open interest at month's end remained high at 830 GWh, down just 8.5% from April’s record.

to 827 GWh.
•  Total monthly sell orders rose slightly by 1.2% to 34.92 TWh; buy orders edged down 0.1% to 25.64
TWh.
•  Sell volumes were impacted by holidays and power plant maintenance but supported by increased
solar power generation. Buy volumes remained subdued due to unstable weather despite rising
demand towards the end of May.
•  Daily buy order peaks were around 900 GWh on May 20-21, driven by increased air-conditioning
demand as many regions experienced summer-like temperatures.




NEWS:    HYDROGEN



Results of bidding for Tokyo Green Hydrogen trial trading
(Government statement, June 9)
•  Tokyo Metropolitan Govt and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) released results for FY2025
first round of bidding for Tokyo Green Hydrogen Trial Trading.
•  Bidding was held for two separate categories: the trailer transport course (2,484 Nm3/ unit), and
the cylinder cradle transport course (263 Nm3/ unit).
•  CONTEXT: A cylinder cradle refers to a set of gas cylinders bundled together for bulk transportation and
supply of industrial gasses.
•  The results are as follows:

Bidding Classification Trailer Transport Course Cradle Transport Course

Number of bidders 1        1
Supply side
Winning bid ¥280/ Nm3      ¥355/ Nm3
Number of bidders 2        3
User side
Winning bid ¥100/ Nm3      ¥280/ Nm3
Delivery conditions of winning
Transport twice a week Total of 6 transports
bid
•  CONTEXT: Tokyo has set up a trial exchange to trade specifically green hydrogen; suppliers and users
bid, and the govt covers the price gaps between them. The first bid was held in December 2024. One
supplier won the bid at a common price of ¥300 for both courses. On the user side, two companies won
in the trailer category at ¥89/Nm³, and two companies won in the cradle category at ¥230/ Nm³.
• TAKEAWAY: Although the bids show the vast gap between what producers can offer and what users are willing
to pay, this also brings necessary transparency to green hydrogen pricing, at least in the domestic context. This
valuable reference price can be utilized by both the supplier and user sides to plan for the future, and for the
government to understand the scale of public support needed to bridge the cost gaps between fossil and green
fuels.

Suntory looks to expand in the green hydrogen business
(Company statement, June 10)
•  In 2027, Suntory Holdings plans to enter the green hydrogen business, collaborating with
Yamanashi Pref and local firms to establish Japan’s first integrated model from production to sales.
•  Suntory plans to start production of green hydrogen at its facility in Hokuto; annual capacity 2,200
tons.
•  The company unveiled a “vision” for the green hydrogen business based on what it claims will be
the largest domestic green hydrogen production site with a 16 MW facility. Suntory is working with
Toray Industries, TEPCO and TEPCO Energy Partners, Kanadevia, Siemens Energy, Kaji Tech, Miura
Co., Nichicon, and the Yamanashi Hydrogen Company.
•  Using its Yamanashi Model P2G (Power-to-Gas) system, which makes hydrogen from power
delivered via renewable energy sources, Suntory plans to expand supply to local consumers and

Tokyo-based businesses.
• TAKEAWAY: Suntory’s production plans were largely unveiled last year, but the company is taking steps to
promote the move as more than a green branding exercise. The drinks maker and the regional authorities want
to spread the use of green hydrogen to a wider set of manufacturers in Yamanashi, which would help build up
the local transportation and storage infrastructure and lower costs for all parties.



Tokyo Univ achieves world-first: synthesizing ammonia from air, water, and light
(Nikkei, June 12)
•  In a world-first breakthrough, a Tokyo University research team led by Professor Nishibayashi
synthesized ammonia at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using only nitrogen from air,
water, a reducing agent, and light.
•  This method bypasses fossil fuels and avoids CO2 emissions, making it a potential game-changer for
clean energy production.
•  Unlike the century-old Haber-Bosch process that needs high temperatures and fossil fuel-derived
hydrogen, the new method relies on nitrogen-fixing bacteria in roots.
• TAKEAWAY: If made practical, this technology could decentralize ammonia production, such as installing
synthesis devices in vehicles or homes, where sunlight, air, and water can be converted into ammonia fuel on-
site, opening the door to “making energy from air.”




NEWS:    SOLAR     AND   BATTERIES



Kushiro City opposes large-scale solar farms
(Government statement, June 1)
•  The Kushiro municipal govt officially stated opposition to large-scale solar projects that do not
harmonize with the local environment.
•  While the city supports the energy transition, it wants to protect natural ecosystems, including the
Kushiro Wetlands, a national park.

JNFL: Rokkasho nuclear fuel reprocessing plant to be completed in FY2026
(Jiji Press, June 8)
•  Japan Nuclear Fuel (JNFL) expects to complete its nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Rokkasho in
FY2026.
•  CONTEXT: The facility was originally scheduled for completion in 1997, but the plant has since faced
27 delays.
•  The facility currently holds about 99% of its 3,000-ton capacity of spent nuclear fuel. Due to the
delays, power companies have to store spent fuel on-site at their plants.
•  KEPCO revised its spent fuel shipment plans based on the 2026 target. It received approval from
Fukui Pref, which allows continued operation of three aging reactors: Takahama units 1 and 2, and
Mihama unit 3. An NRA review is ongoing.

• TAKEAWAY: After the announcement, investor sentiment toward TEPCO turned bullish. With Unit 6 closer to
restart, TEPCO hopes for a financial recovery. Also, local political support emerged for Tokai No. 2, with the
mayor supporting a restart if regulations are met.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kyushu Electric replaces components at Genkai NPP ahead of restart
(Company statement, June 13)
o  Kyushu Electric inspected a valve that caused an error on June 3, as well as three other
valves.
o  After resuming generation, the plant will do adjustment operations to confirm performance.
After increasing output, it will complete a comprehensive load performance test by July 10,
and then the plant will return to normal operation.
o  CONTEXT: Genkai NPP Unit 3 is under its 18th periodic inspection since March 28.



Hokkaido Electric plans new port at Tomari NPP
(Company statement, June 11)
•  Hokkaido Electric plans to build a port as part of safety measures for the Tomari NPP Unit 3.
Located outside the NPP premises, it will serve nuclear fuel transport ships.
•  This contained port would prevent drifting of vessels during a possible tsunami.
•  CONTEXT: Tomari NPP Unit 3 aims to restart in 2027. Port construction will begin soon after and take

around four years. In January, the utility proposed building the external port in response to regulator
concerns. In April, the NRA issued a draft review indicating the plant passed its safety inspection.

JERA agrees to buy more LNG from U.S.
(Company statement, media reports, June 12)
•  JERA will boost purchases of U.S. LNG, seeking to triple supply up to 10 Mtpa by the early 2030s.
This will raise the U.S. share in JERA’s LNG imports from 10% to 30%.
•  JERA has agreed to buy up to 3.5 Mtpa of LNG from three U.S. suppliers: Sempra Infrastructure
(Port Arthur Phase 2, Texas) – 1.5 Mtpa; Commonwealth LNG (Louisiana) – 1 Mtpa; and Cheniere
Energy (Corpus Christi, TX & Sabine Pass, LA) – 1 Mtpa. This is in addition to the 2 Mtpa deal with
NextDecade’s Rio Grande project in Texas.
•  Annual value of these deals is about ¥400 billion ($2.76 billion).
•  CONTEXT: Japan is diversifying supplies due to uncertainty over future Russian LNG supply and
dependence on Australia. It also reflects U.S. efforts, particularly under Trump, to expand LNG exports
to allies.
•  Despite U.S. pressure, JERA remains hesitant about investing in Alaska’s $44 billion LNG project,
citing complex conditions. Currently, JERA's U.S. LNG sourcing comes from the Gulf Coast.
•  CONTEXT: While contracts with NextDecade and Commonwealth are binding, those with Sempra and
Cheniere are not. Together they total 5.5 Mt of LNG per year. Since JERA aims to buy 35 Mtpa of LNG
by 2035, this is more than 15% of the target.
• TAKEAWAY: JERA's deals, like Kyushu Electric’s long-term deal with Lake Charles, are no surprise. JERA said it

was considering reducing dependence on Australian imports through more U.S. supply. The latter is seen as
more reliable and, with Trump in the White House, it’s likely that LNG projects in the U.S. will continue to
receive quick approvals. At this point, the various deals could be seen as a cautious rebalancing of the portfolio.
Is JERA saving some of its powder for the Alaska LNG project, or is it waiting on improved terms from non-U.S.
supply? Either way, decisions on the future of Japan’s LNG sourcing from Russia’s Sakhalin projects will need to
be made this year.



In a first, Mitsubishi Corp to import LNG from Canada
(Nikkei, Jun 12)
•  Mitsubishi Corp will begin importing LNG from Canada in the coming weeks; this is that country’s
first large-scale LNG export to Japan.
•  The gas will come from the LNG Canada Development facility in British Columbia, owned by Shell,
Petronas, China National Petroleum Corp, Korea Gas Corp, and Mitsubishi.
•  CONTEXT: The latter holds a 15% stake in the project and has secured 2.1 Mtpa in offtake. With it,
Mitsubishi’s total LNG capacity will expand from 12.8 to 14.9 Mtpa.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s reliance on LNG from Australia (38% in FY2024) highlights the need for diversification.
These deals increase buying options and reduce supply risks. Canadian LNG offers logistical advantages: shorter
shipping times (10 days) and a route that avoids choke points like the Panama Canal. Also, U.S. policy on LNG
may shift after Trump, while imports from the Middle East could be impacted by hostilities. All of this makes
Canada’s LNG supply very attractive for Japan.

Sumitomo enters biogas business in Denmark

(Company statement, June 12)
•  Sumitomo created a JV with Danish firm Skovgaard Energy to produce biogas, as much as 40
million Nm3 of per year, mainly using cattle manure, and also to develop e-SAF using biomass-
derived CO2 and green hydrogen.
•  This is Sumitomo’s first step into biogas production, aligning with Denmark’s goal of 100% biogas in
its national gas grid by 2030.

ANALYSIS

BY JAPAN NRG TEAM

Power, Politics, and Patience: Inside Japan’s 2025 Energy Shift
Four months after Japan signed off on its revised energy strategy, the government shows
little sign of deviation — despite mounting geopolitical frictions, war-driven supply
risks, and policy reversals elsewhere. Tokyo’s stance is pragmatic: it remains committed
to the long slog of energy transition, but not at the expense of economic stability or
energy security. Japan, in effect, is walking a narrow path between resilience and
reinvention.

Already in 2025, developments are piling up across the sector. Power trading volumes
are surging as derivatives markets deepen. Interest in grid-scale batteries is rising — but
so are doubts about the profitability of some subsidized BESS projects and their grid
connection.
Meanwhile, Japan is nudging forward with a hydrogen subsidy scheme few currently
fully understand and fewer still will be able to access and build around. Nuclear plants
are edging back online, though coal and gas seem to remain indispensable. The power
grid is due for a long-awaited upgrade.

The following outlines key movements in Japan’s energy landscape this year, from LNG
and nuclear to electricity markets, hydrogen and ammonia. The themes are familiar:
slow acceleration, cautious innovation, and a government hoping that coordination can
do what speed alone cannot.

Yuriy Humber
Policy and Strategy
Strategist’s memo: Signals amid the summer
haze
• Japan’s energy policy remains largely on
track, with ministries rolling out subsidy
frameworks, auction tweaks, and
infrastructure reviews across the power,
hydrogen, and grid sectors. Execution remains
uneven, but directional commitment is clear.
• The macro backdrop is giving Tokyo breathing
room. Global energy prices are lower YoY, and the yen’s 9% strengthening helps
offset import costs on paper. But that’s not how it feels to households: gasoline
prices are up over 6% YoY and more persistently elevated than at any point since
1990. The government’s move to reintroduce fuel subsidies is more political than
economic.

• Electricity price volatility has been muted since the shocks of 2021–22, but summer
2025 may bring a spike. Demand is higher during hot months, and the forecast calls
for a hotter-than-average July–September, with uncertainty over rainfall in East
Japan. Markets may test the system’s resilience just as policymakers are refining
reforms.
• Politically, Prime Minister Ishiba heads into the July Upper House election with
weak but steady support. His government has positioned itself as a stabilizing force
amid trade friction with Washington, where LNG diplomacy is back in vogue, and is
doubling down on ties with Europe. Japan remains open to new energy

past overcommitments.

WIND POWER
• Japan passes a bill allowing offshore wind
projects in its EEZ
• METI / MLIT discusses further support for
projects awarded via public tender
• Developers reassess projects in the pipeline
amid economic challenges

The Diet passed a bill amending the Act on Promoting the Utilization of Sea Areas,
enabling offshore wind projects to be developed in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ), both fixed-bottom and floating technologies. Spanning about 4.48 million square
kilometers, the EEZ is more feasible for development due to fewer permitting conflicts
with stakeholders such as fisheries or local governments.
This news comes at a critical time, as Japan's offshore wind sector faces headwinds due
to a weak yen, rising global costs, and an uncertain regulatory framework. Earlier this
year, a consortium led by major trading house Mitsubishi, winner of Round 1 of a public
offshore wind tender, announced its possible withdrawal, casting doubt on its awarded
projects.

On June 3, METI and MLIT discussed support following feedback on revised auction
guidelines. A key issue was whether Round 1 projects, originally awarded under the
Feed-in Tariff (FIT), should be allowed to transition to the Feed-in Premium (FIP). This
faces strong opposition from some stakeholders who argued it could erode trust in the
policy process.
Developers also raised concerns about the need for improved offtaker support and
clearer mechanisms for adjusting prices in zero-premium FIP projects. Without enhanced
state support, industry players warn of broader delays and supply chain disruptions,
especially affecting Round 2 and Round 3 projects.

Japan NRG discussed these challenges in more detail, including floating wind and
regulatory hurdles, in recent issues on February 25 and April 14.
SOLAR POWER
• Agrisolar projects and rooftop solar installations on the rise
• Perovskite cells promoted as a new driver for renewables
• Regulations delayed in mandating recycling of end-of-life solar panels
• Japan needs to install at least 7 GW of solar power annually

With limited suitable land for large-scale solar warms, Japan is boosting agrisolar and
rooftop solar installations. Both options help to grow total renewables capacity without
taking up any more land. Also toward that goal, Japan is betting on perovskite solar
cells, particularly film-type technologies. Sekisui Chemical, Toshiba, Kaneka, EneCoat
Technologies, and Aisin are among key players in this field.

JERA, Sekisui Chemical, and Sanko Metal Industrial launched a PSC demo at a thermal
power station in Kanagawa Prefecture in late May. Earlier that month, ANRE unveiled
plans to boost demand for next-gen PSCs. More on this in the March 10 issue.

Momentum is also building around both on-site and off-site power purchase agreements
(PPAs), including virtual PPAs, reflecting growing corporate demand for decarbonized
power.
In the context of the rapid expansion of data centers, Japan must significantly scale up
solar deployment, between 5 to 7 GW annually by 2030. From 2030 onward, annual
installations must ramp up to 10 to 16 GW (AC) to reach between 203 and 280 GW
(AC) by 2040.

While concerns continue to arise in Japan over mass disposal and landfill use of solar
panels, which are expected to reach the end of lifespan in the 2030s, the government
has yet to clarify who is responsible for their disposal. The MoE and METI decided to
delay the implementation of legislation mandating solar panel recycling.

BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE
• BESS wins big in the the second clean capacity auction (LTDA)
• Battery players grow skeptical over profitability of some LTDA projects
• Government shifts focus to longer duration energy storage / batteries, while
developers see technological and economic challenges
• Japan sees renewed interest in alternative battery technologies
Recent developments in Japan’s renewable energy sector highlight a growing demand
for battery energy storage systems (BESS), driven partly by transmission constraints and
the need to stabilize variable renewable output across a fragmented grid system.

In the second round of the Long-Term Decarbonized Power Sources Auction (LTDA), 27
out of the 38 winning bids were BESS projects. While most projects offer storage
durations of 3–6 hours, only six included systems capable of operating for 6 hours or
more. Results suggest that the current design of the LTDA scheme may be losing appeal,
particularly as developers confront mounting economic and technological challenges.
Developing BESS with durations beyond six hours presents significant challenges. Most
commercial systems use Li-ion batteries, which are optimized for 1–4 hour applications.
Extending operation to 6+ hours introduces risks such as thermal management issues,
faster battery degradation, and reduced efficiency.

Longer-duration BESS requires significantly more storage capacity, leading to higher
capital costs without guaranteed returns. To make such projects viable, developers must
combine multiple revenue streams (arbitrage, grid services, capacity payments). In
response, interest is growing in non-traditional battery chemistries and configurations,
for instance using nickel, signaling a shift toward more diverse and flexible energy
storage solutions.

LNG
• JERA is boosting long-term U.S. LNG imports to
around 30% of supply by 2030
• Japan mulls joining Alaska LNG project, despite
cost and viability concerns
• Mitsubishi-backed LNG Canada due to deliver
first cargo to Japan by July
• Japan’s LNG trading strategy shifts from imports

For Japan's LNG sector, the most important news comes from the other side of the
Pacific. The U.S. will boost LNG production by supporting shale gas and fossil fuel
expansion. More LNG coming from the U.S. via contracts without destination clauses,
also a political necessity to ease Trump's tariffs, indicates that Japan will sell more of
this LNG to third-countries. Domestically, the country is facing declining LNG demand as
nuclear power reactors come on-line, along with expanding renewables capacity.
A key part of Trump's LNG policy revolves around the Alaska LNG project, which should
transport gas to Asia via pipeline. Construction should begin in 2026 and production in
2031. Japanese investors are reported to be considering participating in it, but there are
worries about cost overruns and competitiveness compared to alternatives. LNG Canada,
for example, is about to start shipping the fuel to Japan. The Mitsubishi Corp-backed
project is already looking to expand capacity in the future.

Overall, Japan will focus less on procurement and more on strengthening its LNG
trading capabilities.
NUCLEAR POWER
• Latest clean capacity auction has three nuclear reactors among the winners,
signaling renewed policy support for the sector
• TEPCO wins regulator clearance for test operations at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, but
utility struggles to restart it earlier than this winter
• Japan Atomic’s Tokai No. 2 NPP edges closer to restart after passing NRA review and
local mayor’s endorsement
• Japan’s youngest reactor, Tomari NPP Unit 3, cleared NRA screening after 11 years

In April, OCCTO’s Long-term Decarbonized Power Sources Auction signaled a renewed
push for nuclear energy in Japan. Among the winners were three nuclear reactors –
Tomari 3, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa 6, and Tokai No.2. For TEPCO.
TEPCO is pushing for the restart of either Units 6 or 7 of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa.In the
meantime, public hearings in Niigata Pref through August 31 suggest no decision until
fall. This means, best scenario dictates operations will restart during winter.

TEPCO also has stakes in Tokai No. 2, operated by Japan Atomic Power (JAPC). The
town's mayor recently stated that he will support a restart, provided consent from the
govt and safety is guaranteed.

Further north, Tomari 3, operated by Hokkaido Electric, received NRA safety approval
after 11 years. Final clearance and local consent are pending, but restart is set to
FY2027.

• MIC and METI launched a public-private council to align power and telecom
infrastructure for data center growth

In late March, METI/ ANRE completed a review of the electricity system reform and
outlined measures for addressing issues. In May, a new subcommittee launched and
discussions on the system design began. The main points concern the institutional,
market, and competitive environments of power industries in order to develop next-gen
energy systems.
OCCTO began discussing the long-term outlook for cross-regional grid development
review. In preparation for the third master plan, it will discuss whether to revise the
assumptions and scenarios in the current long-term outlook. The policy includes the
ideal state of the nationwide grid systems over a 10-year period and the approach to
achieving it.

Japan's current two-market system has become increasingly inefficient; thus, a
"Simultaneous Market" to integrate these two markets is now considered. The 7th Basic
Energy Plan outlines frameworks to promote the development of regional grids and
measures to facilitate financing for large-scale interregional power connections.
In March, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) and METI
launched the Public-Private Council on Watt-Bit Coordination Roundtable to shepherd
stakeholders in the power and communication sectors into coordinating their activities,
aiming to improve the efficiency of new infrastructure built to support data centers.

HYDROGEN / AMMONIA
• Japan launched ¥3 trillion CfD scheme to subsidize clean hydrogen/ammonia
supply; initial round over-subscribed with both domestic and overseas projects in
the running
• Initial CfD application window closed in March, but a separate hub development
support program is open to late June
• Next year’s clean capacity auction (LTDA) to be revised to give more favorable
terms for power plans keen to switch to hydrogen or ammonia
After the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act took effect in October 2024, government
initiatives aimed at establishing a low-carbon hydrogen supply chain began, including
"support focusing on price differences (CfD)" and "hub development support."

Applications for the CfD program closed at the end of March and are currently under
review. Applications for the Hub program are being accepted until the end of June.

The government is discussing updates for the third round of the Long-Term
Decarbonized Power Sources Auction (LTDA) in FY2025. The target power sources
include hydrogen/ ammonia co-fired thermal power. Due to the maximum bid price,
companies found it difficult to participate. Therefore, the maximum price for hydrogen
and ammonia fuels will be raised.

Modular Data Centers Seek to Reshape Japan’s AI Infrastructure Boom

As demand for AI explodes, so does the need for new infrastructure. But building a
conventional data center can take three to five years – an eternity in the age of
generative AI, where chip designs evolve every quarter and competitive advantage can
hinge on milliseconds.
One Japanese firm, Getworks, thinks it has a faster answer. Rather than constructing
massive hyperscale facilities from scratch, the company assembles modular, container-
style data centers in factories and ships them out for near-instant deployment. It’s a
plug-and-play model for the AI age – compact, mobile, and quick to install.

Getworks is not alone in recognizing the opportunity. Japan’s digital infrastructure is
straining under a perfect storm of forces: surging AI workloads, growing cloud adoption,
and aging corporate IT systems. As the government pushes for “digital transformation”
and firms rush to modernize, the country faces a compute crunch. Modular data centers
– faster to build, easier to cool, and more flexible in where they operate – offer one
possible solution.
Speed, however, is only part of the appeal. Getworks also seeks to align with broader
shifts in energy and infrastructure policy. Its container units are designed to run on
distributed renewable sources, such as solar and biomass, and to be sited in regions with
surplus power – rather than adding to the load in grid-congested cities. That
decentralization model, if it scales, could support both carbon goals and resilience
against grid strain or seismic disruptions.

With public cloud spending expected to double by 2029 and GPU server demand rising
at over 40% a year, Japan’s data center market is poised for transformation. The race to
create that new infrastructure is on.
The AI-fueled GPU surge
The rise of generative AI has transformed GPUs (graphics processing units) from a niche
tool for research labs into a central pillar of modern computing. Once the domain of
university clusters and deep-pocketed startups, GPU servers are now being snapped up
by sectors ranging from pharma to finance, as companies race to build, fine-tune, or
deploy large language models (LLMs).

Japan is no exception. The domestic GPU server market is projected to grow at 44.7%
annually between FY2023 and FY2028, reaching ¥95 billion in shipment value,
according to Fuji Chimera Research. By then, more than 75% of those servers will be
deployed inside data centers.
It’s not hard to see why. GPU servers are purpose-built for compute-heavy tasks like AI
model training, robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. But their
appetite for electricity and cooling makes them unsuitable for most corporate server
rooms. A single high-end GPU server can consume the same power as 40 conventional
CPU servers – while generating significantly more heat in the process.

As a result, deployment is shifting toward dedicated data centers, whether collocated or
cloud-based.


21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Power and cooling
As Japan’s AI ambitions scale up, its power grid is feeling the strain. GPU servers don’t
just demand more energy – they concentrate that demand in smaller spaces, producing
intense heat loads that push conventional cooling systems to their limits.

Industry figures point to a coming crunch. IDC estimates that a single hyperscale
deployment focused on GPUs could soon require more than 200 MW of dedicated
capacity – roughly equivalent to the power usage of 170,000 Japanese households. That
figure covers compute loads alone; cooling, networking, and backup systems add yet
more pressure.
In a typical data center, cooling accounts for 30–40% of total electricity use. Chillers,
fans, and pumps keep servers from overheating – but they also drive up costs and reduce
efficiency. Japan’s older data centers, designed before the AI boom, often lack the
capacity or layout flexibility to accommodate new cooling technologies.

Liquid cooling and immersion systems are gaining popularity internationally for their
efficiency and smaller footprint. But adoption in Japan remains sluggish. One barrier is
technical: low-temperature water systems risk condensation unless carefully engineered.
Another is fragmentation: server makers still use different specs for pressure, flow, and
temperature, which complicates data center design.
Firms like Getworks argue that starting from a clean slate offers an advantage. Its units
are preconfigured for liquid cooling and optimized for high thermal loads. Whether this
makes a measurable impact on power usage effectiveness (PUE) across deployments
remains to be seen. But in a market where the ability to cool efficiently can make or
break a facility, design choices matter.

Modularity and decentralization as an edge
Unlike the vast plains of the American Midwest or Northern Europe, Japan is a
mountainous archipelago with dense urban cores and limited land availability. Its major
population and business hubs are far from the renewable-rich regions of Hokkaido or
Kyushu, where solar, wind, and biomass generation is concentrated.
That mismatch creates bottlenecks. Grid congestion during peak solar production in
summer, strain from urban energy demand, and vulnerability to seismic disruptions all
make centralized data center construction a risky, expensive proposition. The
government, keen to diversify and decentralize digital infrastructure, is offering support
for regional computing hubs that can operate independently from the big city Tokyo-
Osaka axis.

Modular data centers fit this vision. Because they are built off-site and assembled
quickly, they can be deployed in remote or infrastructure-limited areas. Their compact
size and flexible siting requirements allow them to piggyback on local energy sources or
integrate directly with surplus renewables. For companies looking to reduce latency,
improve resilience, or bypass grid constraints, that flexibility is attractive.
Getworks is attempting to position itself as a solution. Its container-based systems are
designed to run on 50–500 kW per unit, allowing clients to scale up gradually or deploy
in clusters. The firm says it is fielding inquiries for multi-megawatt projects, including
from clients seeking alternatives to long construction timelines or expensive real estate
in urban cores.

As Japan’s data center market shifts from a handful of hyperscale builds to a more
distributed network of edge and regional nodes, modular approaches may offer a middle
path: fast-to-deploy, semi-permanent infrastructure that can grow alongside demand.

23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Green ambitions and energy trade-offs
Most data centers still rely heavily on grid power, which in Japan’s case comes largely
from gas and coal-fired generators. In rural areas, limited transmission infrastructure
makes large-scale expansion difficult.
Getworks sees an opportunity in this mismatch. The company prioritizes renewables
integration into its modular facilities, aiming to site them near solar, biomass, or other
distributed energy sources. This is not purely a climate play. For many locations, clean
energy is the only viable source of capacity – especially for rapid-deployment builds far
from city grids.

To burnish its green credentials, the company also incorporates liquid cooling and even
groundwater-based heat exchange – a rare method in Japan. By drawing water from
wells to manage server temperatures and recycling waste heat, the company hopes to
cut energy overhead and improve PUE. Whether these systems can be scaled cost-
effectively across multiple deployments is yet to be tested.















Source: Getworks

Conclusion
Japan’s digital future is arriving faster than its infrastructure can keep up. As companies
race to deploy generative AI, modernize legacy IT systems, and absorb ever-growing
volumes of internet traffic, demand for data center capacity is outpacing supply.
Container-based data centers won’t replace hyperscale campuses, but they could play a
vital supporting role. Their speed, modularity, and adaptability make them well-suited
to regions where land is scarce, energy is constrained, or compute demand is
fragmented. In Japan’s underdeveloped mid-sized data center segment, they may help
fill the gap.

They also represent a potential new class of customer for renewables developers. Unlike
urban hyperscalers tethered to congested grids, modular data centers can be deployed
closer to wind, solar, or biomass assets in rural areas, and connected through PPAs. That
pairing could make the economics of clean power more viable outside Japan’s urban
cores.
