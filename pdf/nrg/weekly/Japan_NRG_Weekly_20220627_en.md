NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Japan cancels financing for overseas coal power projects, in line with G7 pledges
(Ministry Statement, June 22)
•  Japan will suspend ODA (official development assistance) for the 1.2 GW Matavali coal-fired power
project in Bangladesh.
•  The suspension is in line with agreements made by Japan at the G7 Summit in June 2021 to
terminate new international direct government support for coal-fired power generation in which no

emission reduction measures were taken by end of 2021.
•  Japan discussed the issue with the Bangladeshi side and promised to continue providing support
for a “realistic transition toward a decarbonized society”.
•  Japan will also no longer fund the Indramayu coal-fired plant in Indonesia, based on the
Indonesian government’s decision not to continue with the plans.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is canceling the Bangladeshi project ahead of the next G7 meeting, which starts this week.
However, if the project is revised to include CO2 capture tech or co-firing technologies or both, it is possible

for the plans to be revived. Japan’s commitment extends to not funding “unabated” coal-fired power plants.



Mitsubishi to start selling green power certificates in Japan’s first VPP accord

(Asia Nikkei, June 24)
•  Trading house Mitsubishi Corp. will start selling renewable electricity certificates that buyers can
use as offsets for their energy consumption. Murata Manufacturing, an electronic components
maker and major Apple supplier, will be the first to receive a certificate.
•  CONTEXT: This will be Japan's first case of a so-called virtual power purchase agreement.
•  Under the scheme, Mitsubishi will actually build a solar power plant and deliver generated
electricity to the utilities market, and separately sell renewable energy certificates to those who

want to use them as offsets. The purchaser of a certificate might not necessarily use renewable
electricity but the certificate still acts as an offset.


Japan’s latest solar auction results: winning bids under ¥10 per kWh
(Kankyo Business, June 21)

(Company Statement, June 17)
o  We won the 12th solar power bidding in June 2022 at a supply price of ¥9.86/ kWh for a
power generation facility with a 77 MW output. This is a plant utilizing a golf course

located in Yamaguchi Prefecture, scheduled to start in 2027.


PM announces scheme to reward energy-saving
(TBS, June 21)
•  PM Kishida announced a scheme that will award households and businesses points for saving
electricity, especially during supply shortages.
•  Points will be able to be earned and redeemed using a smartphone app.




Japanese companies to boost capital investment by 25% this fiscal year
(Nikkei Asia, June 21)
•  A Nikkei survey showed Japanese companies plan to boost capital investment by 25% this fiscal
year as they try to catch up on plans delayed by the pandemic and supply chain problems.

•  Manufacturers such as Nissan, Suzuki and Panasonic also cite growing demand for EVs and related
products.
•  Planned capital spending by 876 major companies increased for the first time in three years, to
¥28.66 trillion ($212 billion) -- the second highest tally on record.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kishida backs Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policy despite weak yen

(Nikkei, June 22)
o  The BoJ should maintain its course of monetary easing, PM Kishida said, signaling
support for a policy criticized as helping to weaken the yen in the current global
environment.
o  "Monetary policy needs to be decided by looking at the whole picture," he said, adding
that "now is not the time to alter it."
o  "It's important to focus policy on energy and food," he said, noting that more than 60%

of Japan's current inflation comes from the former.

•  CONTEXT: Some technologies, such as wireless data transmission, have wide applications outside
energy with varied licensing practices. Clear licensing rules may be required as some licensors may

ask a fee basis for the “social and climate value” of the final products such as electric vehicles,
rather than on the number of devices that use the technologies.


Government-private sector council on aviation launched
(Japan NRG, June 20)
•  The government-private sector council on zero emission aviation technologies was launched to

develop aircraft powered by hydrogen or batteries. Participants included 12 manufacturers of
aircraft and components, two airlines, national research institutes, relevant industry associations,
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and METI. Airport authorities have also
joined as observers.
•  CONTEXT: Hydrogen has more space requirement than jet fuel, and there are safety issues that
have not been resolved for flying with lithium-ion batteries.



Nuclear Regulation Authority to continue studies on meteorological tsunamis

(Japan NRG, June 23)
•  The Nuclear Regulation Authority will continue to study the mechanism of meteorological tsunamis
following the Tonga earthquake, despite its initial finding that their risks are low. The earthquake in
January this year changed atmospheric pressures causing the tsunami, rather than the volcanic
eruption. While the risk of such tsunamis affecting nuclear safety is low as they rarely occur, the

Tonga quake showed that meteorological tsunamis travel faster than volcanic tsunamis and the
Pacific Ocean has many volcanoes that may erupt.



METI to push development of small hydrogen electrolyzers

(Japan NRG, June 23)
•  METI will push development of small hydrogen electrolyzers for factories. The European Union
plans to install electrolyzers totaling 40 GW by 2030, creating demand for equipment and
opportunities for Japanese businesses.
•  METI will support speedy development of electrolyzer systems and their applications notably to
convert redundant power into hydrogen. By around 2030 when renewables comprise 50-60% of
the country's power supplies, up to 200 TWh/ year will be redundant depending on weather and
demand. The excess power could produce 4.7 million tons/ year of hydrogen.
•  The cost of hydrogen production using renewable electricity is ¥55-60/ kWh, which will be lower

than grid power on a base assumption that renewable power rates are ¥8-9/ kWh and grid power
¥10/ kWh. Hydrogen produced using grid power supplies is estimated to be ¥64.6/ kWh.



Kasawaki, KEPCO achieve hydrogen supply chain milestone
(Denki Shimbun, June 23)
•  A consortium that includes Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Kansai Electric says it used hydrogen

shipped from Australia to power a 1.7 MW cogeneration plant in Kobe for the first time.
•  While not yet commercial scale, the operation represents the completion of one hydrogen supply
chain between Australia and Japan.


Mixed expectations on climate shareholder proposals ahead of this week’s AGMs
(Toyo Keizai, June 22)
•  The article previews the upcoming AGMs of the five Japanese companies that have received e

climate change-related shareholder proposals: Mitsubishi Corp, Sumitomo Mitsui FG, TEPCO
Holdings, Chubu Electric, and J-POWER.
•  In past years, such proposals received a 20-30% approval from shareholders. Mizuho FG and
Mitsubishi UFJ FG were asked to improve their approach to climate change.
•  For Mitsubishi’s AGM, TEPCO, Chubu Electric, and Sumitomo Mitsui, the Australian environmental
NGO Market Force and Japan's Climate Network submitted proposals. For J-POWER, three
European institutional investors, including Amundi, a French asset management company,

submitted proposals together with the Australian NGO ACCR.
•  ACCR claims that the reason for its proposal is that J-POWER is Japan's largest coal-fired power
generation operator and risks losing its corporate value as Japan reduces emissions in line with its
net-zero 2050 targets.
•  Voting advisory firms such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis have a major
influence on how institutional investors exercise their voting rights. While both companies

recommended against the shareholder proposal for Sumitomo Mitsui, they were divided on the
proposal for Mitsubishi.

IHI in synthetic methane trial
(Nikkei, June 20)
•  In a trial conducted by IHI in Fukushima, local buses will be powered by synthetically-produced
methane.
•  Methane is produced by reacting hydrogen with factory CO2 emissions.

•  Conversion of buses and trucks to run on methane is relatively simple, and is a cost effective
alternative to replacement with electric fleets.


Hitachi Zosen installs Japan’s biggest methanation facility in Kanagawa

(New Energy Business News, June 23)
•  Hitachi Zosen installed a methanation facility at its base in Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture.
The facility produces methane by synthesizing CO2 emitted from cleaning plants and hydrogen.
Production is 125 Nm3 per hour, the largest in Japan and comparable to a commercial natural gas
satellite supply facility.
•  The project is part of an MoE initiative. The synthetic methane produced will be combusted in a
methane gas utilization facility to make electricity.



Osaka Gas installs methanation equipment and seeks to kickstart production
(Denki Shimbun, June 24)
•  Osaka Gas has installed experimental equipment for methanation at its R&D base in Osaka City.
Methane is produced using SOECs (solid oxide water electrolysis cells) and also with
"biomethanation" that makes methane from sewage and other waste materials.
•  The goal is to introduce synthetic methane by 2030 to 1% of Osaka Gas’ total gas sales. It was

Japan’s first company to make a prototype of a SOEC practical size cell.
•  The company expects SOEC to achieve the world's highest level of energy conversion efficiency, at
~85% to 90% of energy input.
•  Biomethanation will proceed with field tests at a sewage treatment plant in Osaka City, with a view
to commercializing the technology around 2030.


Idemitsu to develop solid state batteries with Belgium’s Umicore

(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, June 23)
•  Idemitsu will partner with Belgium’s Umicore to develop high-performance solid state battery
technology enabling high capacity and rapid charging.
•  Idemitsu brings to the partnership its expertise in the manufacture of highly pure lithium sulfide.


TEPCO EP and Energy Pool to study power-to-gas system for hydrogen in Yamanashi

(New Energy Business News, June 24)
•  TEPCO Energy Partners (TEP), the local unit of France’s Energy Pool, and Yamanashi Prefecture will
study the potential to use a (power to gas) P2G system to make hydrogen from renewable energy
at the Yonekurayama research site in Kofu City.
•  The P2G system uses water electrolysis to produce hydrogen, which is then used to balance supply
and demand in the power network.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Yonekurayama will host research on production and storage of hydrogen from tap water using
electricity from solar power and a large solid polymer electrolyzer (PEM). It will also assess the
creation of a demand response (DR) function, which would divert excess solar electricity to
hydrogen that could then be utilized as a heat source for boilers.



SB Energy and Elixir eye gigawatt-scale green H2 production in Mongolia
(SB Energy Press Release, June 22)
•  SB Energy Corporation (SBG subsidiary) and Elixir Energy Ltd. will develop a green hydrogen
project in the Gobi Desert.
•  The goal is to jointly develop a gigawatt-class green hydrogen production project.




INPEX allies with AGL Energy to study hydrogen project in Australia
(Company Statement, June 17)
•  INPEX signed an MoU with Australian energy provider AGL Energy (AGL) to conduct a feasibility

study for AGL’s Torrens Island Hydrogen Hub in the state of South Australia.
•  The hub has the potential for the production and export of green hydrogen and the
commercialization of methanation from hydrogen.
•  CONTEXT: Osaka Gas is also one of the partners.
•  CONTEXT: INPEX wants to commercialize three or more hydrogen projects by 2030 in order to
produce and supply 100,000 tons or more of hydrogen/ammonia per year.



Okinawa Electric and others look at local ammonia production project

(Kankyo Business, June 21)
•  Okinawa Electric, Tsubame BHB, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries will study the potential for local
production for local consumption of clean ammonia in Okinawa.
•  The ammonia would be produced using renewable energy and deployed as a second fuel at local
coal-fired power stations such as the Gushigawa Thermal Power Plant.
•  The results of these studies will be compiled by the end of FY2022.
•  CONTEXT: Tsubame BHB has developed ammonia catalyst technology and is creating a

distributed ammonia production system.

METI finalizes proposed revision of offshore wind auction rules
(Japan NRG, June 23)
•  METI finalized its proposal for revising the offshore wind auction rules for a review by the joint
METI-Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism panel. It remains divided on limiting a
single consortium or a bidder to participate in multiple auctions.
•  Other proposed changes include changes in the weighting of evaluation criteria and a process to

reflect local stakeholder interests through governors. Whether the names of third-party experts
making the assessments should be made public was also discussed.
•  The panel is expected to reach its decisions at the next meeting.
•  The plan is also to conduct public comments on the draft and discuss it in the Subcommittee on
Mass Adoption of Renewable Energy and Next Generation Electric Power Networks.




International oil companies likely to joint next round of wind tenders
(Diamond, June 20)
•  The Japanese government is now inviting tenders for a second tranche of major offshore wind farm
projects. In the first round, construction contracts were awarded to a Mitsubishi-led consortium
that undercut the competition with rock-bottom bids.
•  This time, Marubeni and Tokyo Gas have joined forces to ensure Mitsubishi does not walk away

with another “clean sweep”.
•  The upcoming round of projects have generated interest overseas as well; in April, at least one
senior official at a company in the tender was contacted by a major international oil company that
wanted to join the bid in return for letting the Japanese company join its European projects.
•  Shell, BP and Total are keen to be more active in the renewables sector, especially since there’s a
need to divest from Russian oil and gas.
•  Having judged that winning the first round of tenders was not necessarily to their advantage, the

international oil companies have a chance in the upcoming tenders, provided their bids are
competitive.
•  Of the upcoming offshore wind projects, those in Happo and Noshiro (Akita) look likely to go to
the Mitsubishi Corp Energy Solutions consortium.
•  The other Akita-based projects are most likely to go to the JERA/J-Power consortium, with
possible involvement from BP, Shell or Total.
•  Projects in Nagasaki and Niigata are likely to go to Japan Renewable Energy and a consortium led

by Cosmo Eco Power, respectively.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Rivals desperate to stop another Mitsubishi “clean sweep”
(Nikkei, June 21)
o  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by columnist Murakami Megumu.


12


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  After a Mitsubishi-led consortium walked away with all contracts at the first round of
offshore wind tenders, the Japan Wind Power Association asked the government to
emphasize contractors’ ability to complete projects quickly, rather than the lowest
bidder.
o  The JWPA’s comments were a reference to Mitsubishi’s completion timelines of 2028-

2030—significantly later than those of other bidders.
o  The JWPA subsequently proposed limiting the number of projects that can be awarded
to any single consortium to 30% of the total projects available in the first and second
tranche of tenders.
o  However, fellow JWPA member Mitsubishi Corp Energy Solutions said it only heard
about that proposal at the last minute. CEO Iwasaki Yoshihiro said he felt the other
members don't want any contracts to go to Mitsubishi.

o  Government officials, who argue that awarding projects to the lowest bidder benefits the
consumer, have criticized attempts to change the rules.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Government to consider speed of completion in wind farm contracts
(Mainichi Shimbun, June 24)
o  METI revised the criteria used to evaluate bids for offshore wind farms.

o  Proposals will now be evaluated on speed of completion as well as cost.
o  There is speculation on why the government revised the selection criteria a mere six
months after the first offshore wind farm tender was announced.
o  Mitsubishi Corporation warns that prioritizing the timing of the start of operations will
simply give advantage to those companies that began on-site inspections early in the
area up for auction.
o  Protecting the bids against one company dominating is also viewed by some as

discouraging for those trying creative business models.
• TAKEAWAY: With the offshore wind power business in Japan still in its infancy, the back and forth is par for the
course. But even the media are starting to discuss the negative impression such volatility in rulemaking will
have on the Japanese market. With all sides now unhappy, the only thing that stands out is the dissonance.



JERA to restart thermal power stations
(Diamond, June 20)
•  JERA will restart Unit 5 of the Anegasaki gas-fired power station (Chiba) and Unit 5 of the Chita
coal/gas-fired power station (Aichi) in July, boosting generation capacity in the relevant areas by
around 1%.
•  Demand for electricity in July was projected to exceed 97% of capacity.

• TAKEAWAY: This is a temporary restart of two aging thermal power plants for two months to cope with
possible power shortages. With over 40 years in operation, the facilities have rust and paint peeling, according
to local managers, but still, they’ve been rushed back into service. One issue to keep in mind is the higher risk
of malfunction at older facilities. Another is that the cost of restarting these power plants will be added to
transmission line charges, and will be borne by consumers.

Governor slams Kansai Electric’s approach to wind power

(Kahoku Shimbun, June 21)
•  Miyagi Governor Murai slammed Kansai Electric’s “insincere” decision to hold closed-door
consultations with residents of the Kawasaki community, which is home to a proposed wind farm.
•  An environmental assessment conducted by the prefectural government was critical of KEPCO’s
plans to build wind turbines in a national park.
•  While KEPCO changed its plans to exclude national parks, Murai said KEPCO failed to

demonstrate concern for the natural environment.


Hokkaido town starts applications for offshore wind surveys
(New Energy Business News, June 23)
•  The town of Suttsu, Hokkaido, began accepting applications from companies interested in a survey
for the introduction of offshore wind power in the Iwau and Minami-Goshi Offshore Areas. The

application period is until July 15, 2022.
•  The project will survey areas not tackled by the offshore wind study now carried out by METI and
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).
•  The target waters are basically shallow waters of less than 50 meters in depth. Several fishing
cooperatives own the rights there.
•  CONTEXT: Suttsu is also interested as a site of the nuclear waste storage facility.




Nishimatsu to build five biomass power plants
(New Energy Business News, June 22)
•  Nishimatsu Corp established a subsidiary, Sanyo-Onoda Green Energy Co. to develop a woody
biomass power generation business in Yamaguchi Prefecture. Nishimatsu owns 100% of the
company, but plans to obtain investments from several others.
•  The new entity will build and operate a 1.99 MW-class woody biomass power plant burning

domestic wood chips in Sanyo-Onoda City. The electricity generated will be sold to Chugoku

June 2023, and commercial operation in the summer of 2024.
•  This is the first of five biomass power plants Nishimatsu plans in Japan by 2030, and will invest ¥15
billion in total to build. Each plant is expected to have a 2 to 5 MW output.

NEWS:     OIL,   GAS   &  MINING






Cosmo drops fuel prices for the first time in five weeks
(Sekiyu Tsushin, June 24)
•  Cosmo Oil Marketing notified its distributors of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil that the
purchase prices for June 24-30 will drop by ¥1.5 compared to a week earlier.
•  The price cut is the first in five weeks and is related to the government's subsidies for fossil fuels.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan Petroleum Association chair says too early to exit subsidies
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, June 23)
o  Chair of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ) and Chair of ENEOS Holdings,
Sugimori, said oil prices are not in a phase of rapid decline yet and that some time may
be needed for an exit strategy from state oil subsidies, which have now been extended
until the end of September.
o  The PAJ board has decided to make additional demands to the government regarding

taxes related to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). It seeks to set up import duty exemption
systems for SAF raw materials and neat SAF, as well as exemptions for oil and coal taxes,
and also add SAF manufacturing plants to the carbon neutral investment tax program.
• TAKEAWAY: The oil industry seeks to prolong the timeline of the subsidies, which currently run until the end of
September. Their argument is that oil subsidies are currently around ¥40 per barrel due to the high crude
prices and it’s unlikely that prices will drop suddenly in the remaining period. The government is more likely to

make a decision on expanding subsidies at a later stage but the reason PAJ is raising it now is likely to extract
promises before the upper-house elections in early July during which price increases and inflation are hot
topics.



Mitsui and Mitsubishi hesitancy towards new LNG worries government
(Diamond, June 23)
•  Japan’s leading investors in LNG globally are the two large trading houses, Mitsubishi Corporation
and Mitsui & Co. But now they hesitate to make new investments.
•  METI estimates that without new investments in upstream gas projects by Japanese firms, the
country’s LNG supply and demand could become tight until 2025 and again after 2030, causing

energy prices to soar. In the worst-case scenario where LNG supply from Russia is disrupted, Japan
will even face a power outage crisis.
•  Mitsui and Mitsubishi’s reluctance to expand in the LNG business is because of the long lead times
and large sums required. An industry joke refers to LNG as the Long Negotiation Game because
new projects require investments in the region of ¥1 trillion, take five to six years to build and start
producing, and need decades to make back the money through long-term contracts with utilities.
•  In the past, Japanese power and gas utilities easily committed to 10–20-year LNG purchase

contracts but electricity market deregulation has made it harder to predict demand volumes. With

that, utilities prefer short term contracts (one to five years), but it’s not enough to support new LNG
investments.
•  Meanwhile, institutional investors are pushing Japanese traders to exit fossil fuels.
•  In lieu of Mitsui and Mitsubishi, JERA is stepping up to be a major LNG investor.




JOGMEC  Provides Equity Financing to INPEX’s Exploration Project in Abu Dhabi

New Nuclear Regulator Chief
Stirs Industry Hopes for Warmer Relations

In less than two months, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) will
change. With current chair Fuketa Toyoshi stepping down, all of the original
commissioners appointed when the regulator was set up in 2012 will have left. Fuketa
is the last of the NRA senior staff appointed during that early period in NRA’s
formation when the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) was in power.

In theory, when Yamanaka Shinsuke assumes the top NRA role on Sept. 22, little
should change. While Yamanaka’s candidature had to go through a parliamentary
approval process, and the NRA is couched within the MoE, the administrative body
operates at arms-length from the government.

Still, many expect (or hope) Yamanaka’s leadership to be different from that of his
predecessors. Both Fuketa and the NRA’s first chairman Tanaka Shunichi were
reportedly hard on Japan’s major utilities. Power companies complained that even an
email from them was viewed as an attempt at subterfuge, and at times communication
between the regulator and industry was tense.

Yamanaka’s appointment is viewed as a favorable development by the industry,
according to trade media such as the Denki Shimbun. He will also take over at a time
when the restart of idled nuclear reactors is a priority for Prime Minister Kishida and
his government.

With the NRA’s length of reviews now openly questioned by lawmakers and the media
– something that was almost taboo for a decade after the Fukushima nuclear disaster
– change in regulator leadership is likely to filter into the way the watchdog operates.
But even that may not be the silver bullet that Japan’s nuclear utilities need to bring
their facilities online.

Predecessor’s track record
NRA’s first chair, Tanaka, was appointed with a mission to create a truly independent
regulator, not one with cozy industry ties. The previous watchdog had resided within
METI, a ministry also tasked with promoting nuclear energy and the export of nuclear
technologies. The dual role of supporting and policing the nuclear industry was
heavily criticized after the accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP in 2011.

Tanaka promised to introduce the world’s highest nuclear safety requirements. His
work is now put into practice by utilities through multi-billion-dollar upgrades of safety
measures at Japanese nuclear reactors.

Tanaka stepped down in 2017, but Fuketa was seen as closely aligned with his
predecessor’s tough stance on the industry. During Fuketa’s five-year term, just five
reactors received approval for a restart, two of those occurring a few months after he
took up the position. This compares with 12 reactors approved in the three years prior
to Fuketa’s promotion to chairman.

Yamanaka is two years older than Fuketa but joined the commission only in
September 2017, the moment that Fuketa became chairman. While Fuketa joined the

NRA at its inception from the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Yamanaka moved
over from academia. He was previously a professor at Osaka University, where he
specialized in nuclear fuel safety research.

While Yamanaka worked closely as part of Fuketa’s five-person commissioner team, he
is seen differently. In addition to the cautiously positive reception from nuclear utilities
noted in the trade media, Yamanaka’s appointment was quizzed by the anti-nuclear
Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (the main successor of the now defunct DPJ)
and the Communist Party of Japan.

One of the Communist Party’s objections was the NRA’s approval to extend the life of
four reactors from the original 40-year operating license. Yamanaka was in charge of
the relevant committee and backed the decision.


A time of troubles
Yamanaka will inherit a difficult job. As nationwide energy shortages and higher power
prices swing public opinion in favor of nuclear power plant restarts, politicians are
calling for a faster review process. Former NRA chief Tanaka recently warned against
such pressures, telling lawmakers to focus on persuading the public – not meddling
with the regulators.

That said, the NRA's review of certain facilities is raising eyebrows. The Tomari NPP in
Hokkaido is about to start its 10th year under review with core issues around the plant
barely resolved; for example, does it sit on an active fault. Former chief Tanaka put
the blame for this on geology experts, on whom the NRA relies on for such decisions.

Any attempt by Yamanaka to speed up the discussions around the Tomari plant will
now be further complicated by two recent court decisions. Sapporo District Court
ruled on May 31 that on the one hand the Tomari plant does not meet safety
standards to counter the risk of tsunami; on the other hand, the court stopped short of
demanding decommissioning.

With the Tomari legal and geological issues a mess, Yamanaka has few other things
that he can realistically speed up. Outside Hokkaido, there are just five other reactors
under NRA review for a restart:
-  two units at the Hamaoka NPP (Chubu Electric)
-  one unit at Tsuruga NPP (Japan Atomic)
-  one unit at Higashidori NPP (Tohoku Electric)
-  one unit at Shika NPP (Hokuriku Electric)


Technological divide
Another complication is the reactor technology divide. While most of the world relies
on pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology, Japan is the only country that has
more boiling water reactor (BWR) systems than PWRs (17 vs 16). Since the technology
employed at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP was BWR, Japanese politicians have
primarily supported the restart of PWRs even though other factors that caused the
Fukushima disaster were far more influential.

In the 11 years since the Fukushima accident, there has yet to be a restart of a BWR
reactor in Japan. Half the reactors still under NRA review are BWRs.

| over from academia. He was previously a professor at Osaka University, where he |
| --- |
| specialized in |

This situation, however, is about to change. On June 2, Shimane Governor Maruyama
announced his consent to the restart of Chugoku Electric’s Shimane NPP Unit, which
uses BWRs. The local authorities at Matsue City had already given their consent, so a
restart should now proceed.

How well it goes will be crucial to further deployment of nuclear power in Japan since
anti-nuclear newspapers have already described the Shimane facility as employing
“the same reactor type as Fukushima”. The Shimane unit was commissioned in 1989,
about 18 years after the building of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP.

Without the restart of BWR units, Japan’s central and northern regions will remain
nuclear-free. Since the volume of power that can be sent from one region of Japan to
another is limited, this is a headache for the grids that service Tokyo and its
surrounding area.


Positive signals
A change at the helm of NRA is taken as a positive signal by the nuclear industry, but
it will not be a gamechanger. For one, Yamanaka has already served with the NRA for
five years and he is unlikely to entirely revamp the processes to suit the political
agenda of the day.

What’s more, the NRA is only one “bottleneck” in the restart process. Arguably a
bigger one is local politics. And in that light, the late May gubernatorial election in
Niigata Prefecture was a more significant move. It saw incumbent Hideyo Hanazumi
(64, supported by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party) defeat independent challenger
Naomi Katagiri (72, recommended by the Communist Party, Reiwa, and Social
Democratic Party). Hanazumi received more than three times Katagiri's votes: 703,694
to 203,845.

Interestingly, Hanazumi said he would defer to the local mood before accepting the
restart of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP (TEPCO), but the issue figured fairly low on the
electorate’s agenda. A poll before the election showed people were far more
interested in economic and employment issues than the fate of the nuclear facility.

The way forward for Japan’s nuclear industry is to explain that the solution to the
former lies in the latter. Kishida has already made comments in that light. The July 10
upper-house elections will show us if the public agrees.

Methanol Takes First Steps as Low Carbon Fuel in Japan

As a low carbon fuel, methanol has so far been given little attention in Japan. With
announcements of mega e-methanol projects over the past year across the globe,
however, that could all change.

With so much focus on hydrogen and ammonia research and development, Japan has
hitherto given little consideration to other innovative renewable energy forms based
on fluids. Now, Europe is pushing methanol as a new alternative to fossil fuels and
Japan is taking notice.

Growing demand in new markets, such as marine fuel and fuel cells, have business
and government leaders in Tokyo starting to consider the versatile fuel’s potential to
help meet 2050 net-zero goals and open new markets abroad.

Furthermore, to make methanol an even more attractive option, businesses can use it
as a low carbon fuel and hydrogen carrier, expanding its traditional role as a key
constituent in the chemicals sector.


Growing green marine transport market
In recent months, methanol’s public profile has grown quickly following
announcements of massive new green e-methanol plants, primarily to supply a
growing green marine transport market.

These include Engie’s 1.85 GW wind-generated hydrogen and captured CO plans in
2
Holland – partly aimed at reducing Europe’s reliance on imported gas. Engie will
initially build a 100 MW electrolyzer in 2025 (expanding to 1.85 GW in the early
2030s) to produce hydrogen that will be combined with biogenic CO from a power
2
plant.
In addition, Danish energy company Ørsted signed a deal in March to supply shipping
company Maersk with 300 kt of e-methanol annually in the U.S. Gulf coast area, where
it plans to build a 675 MW, 300 kt power-to-methanol plant that will use green
hydrogen.
The plant is slated to start-up in the second half of 2025 and will use captured
biogenic CO. The two companies are already partners in a 1.2 GW Green Fuels for
2
Denmark e-methanol project, announced in 2021.

25% global market share by 2050
The green methanol market has gained a significant boost thanks to Maersk, the
world’s biggest integrated shipping company. While Japanese shippers' preference
has been first to shift to LNG-fueled ships and later adopt ammonia-powered engines,
Maersk has set its course on a methanol-backed transition.



21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The Danish company recently ordered 12 methanol-powered vessels, which will
require 490,000 metric tons a year of sustainable methanol. A senior executive said
green methanol was the only “market-ready and scalable available solution” available
today to decarbonize shipping.

To supply this fleet (on top of the deals with Ørsted), Maersk has secured supply from
European Energy starting in 2025/26 that will be produced in Europe and the
Americas, along with 50,000 metric tons of bio-methanol, each from two Chinese
companies (CIMC ENRIC and Green Tech Bank).

It has also lined up deals for bio-methanol from WasteFuel, and either bio- or e-
methanol from Proman – both to be supplied in the Americas. Nevertheless, Maersk
has yet to sign enough deals to meet its goal of shipping 25% of all freight with
renewable fuels by 2030.

Other big international shippers are now also considering methanol, and the take up
could be significant given looming IMO carbon reduction targets. According to S&P
Global Platts, methanol could take a 25% share of the marine vessel orderbook by
2050, with another 10% going to biofuels.

Currently, Waterfront Shipping (a subsidiary of Methanex, the world’s biggest
methanol producer) has the largest methanol-fueled fleet, although it’s derived from
fossil-feedstock. This makes the fuel better established for marine transport than
competing hydrogen carrier, ammonia, which has yet to be used to fuel vessels.

Japanese firms only plan to produce their first ammonia-fuel ship by the middle of this
decade. In addition, ammonia must be pressurized, which adds energy and handling
costs.


Low carbon methanol options
E-methanol’s carbon footprint can vary, depending on the source of CO and
2
hydrogen. E-methanol that uses fossil fuel-derived CO effectively recycles carbon
2
before it is emitted, displacing the use of more fossil fuels in the process.
While this is the most easily accessed product, and the basis of many new projects, it
only cuts emissions by half. Using biogenic (renewable plant-sourced) CO produces
2
much lower net emissions.
CO from direct air capture would also be acceptable and fit with net-zero
2
commitments. Bio-methanol from biomass or biogas is another low carbon methanol
option. Using methanol derived in these ways displaces fossil fuel use, cutting CO
2
emissions and also dramatically reducing SOx, NOx, and particulates.
On the demand side, methanol has other applications in a future hydrogen economy.
For example, some argue that since it’s easily stored and transported as a stable
liquid, methanol is a better hydrogen carrier than ammonia when supplying the gas to
dispersed outlets such as road fueling stations.
The International Renewable Energy Agency expects renewable (bio-methanol and e-
methanol) methanol production to reach 500 million metric tons by 2050, five times

22

more than today’s levels. That’s a conservative target and could be bigger if the fuel
was to meet 25% of new shipping demand.


Methanol for Japan
In its efforts to decarbonize, Japan is primarily focused on renewables and gaseous
fuels. Methanol is not high on the agenda, although this could be changing.
Hydrogen is key to Japan’s low carbon plans, and methanol’s role as a hydrogen
carrier could help it gain traction.

High handling, storage, and transport costs in the mountainous and heavily populated
country means it’s not an easy place to deploy hydrogen at scale for off-grid power or
road transport. Methanol has already proven it can address these problems in Japan,
with over 300 methanol fuel cells successfully distributed to generate power following
the Fukushima disaster.

Methanol is also being adopted by some Japanese shippers, although not necessarily
in its low carbon form. The biggest, MOL, has bought four ocean going methanol
fueled vessels. And in March, it ordered one for use in domestic Japanese waters.

Japan has been involved in conventional methanol production (from natural gas) for
decades, with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical the world’s third biggest producer. Recent
advances by the company have included the piloting of methanol production using
CO and hydrogen at its Niigata facility.
2
The project involves the production of ‘Circular Carbon Methanol’ (CCM) in which
emitted CO and waste plastics are used. MGC is also active in applications, with its
2
direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) offering a lighter, more stable alternative to
hydrogen fuel cells.
Other interested parties in Japan are also beginning to identify opportunities for
methanol projects, though mainly abroad. In May, trading house Itochu announced
plans to build a blue ammonia and methanol plant in Canada, adding to its gas-based
methanol facility in Brunei. Mitsui & Co. last year invested to boost CO -derived
2
methanol output in Dallas, U.S., while Marubeni had explored a Russian methanol
venture.
Inside Japan, many of the projects in this sector focus on bio-methanol that can be
produced from agricultural and municipal solid waste - either from biogas or from the
gasification of the biomass feedstock.

However, for the innovative methanol technology to take off domestically, more
support from business and government leaders is required, especially in R&D.

The key to methanol’s adoption now rests with Japan’s merchant fleet, one of the
world’s largest. With the global LNG market now severely constrained by a surge in
demand in Europe, and the molecule’s high prices expected to last for years to come,
Japanese may well reconsider their move to retrofit tankers with natural gas-fired
engines. An uptick in global methanol production offers an alternative.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Africa/ Energy transition
About $25 billion is needed annually through 2030 to develop the continent’s energy
sector, said the IEA. Access to electricity in Africa fell by 4% between 2019 and 2021,
said IEA director Fatih Birol, adding that development banks needed to take “urgent
action” to increase investment in Africa’s renewable energy sector.

Brazil/ Offshore wind
Ocean Winds, a JV between France’s Engie and Spain’s EDP Renewables, plans to
build five offshore wind projects with a total generating capacity of 15 GW. The
projects will be located in the states of Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio de Janeiro,
and Rio Grande do Sul.

Energy investments
Global energy investment will rise 8% to a record $2.4 trillion in 2022, with clean
energy garnering $1.4 trillion of the total. Coal investment, however, is also growing,
says a report by the IEA. In related news, BlackRock is launching a program to invest
in helping polluting companies go green. More than half of its investments will focus
on Europe.
Energy transition/ Steel industry
The global steel industry may have to write down as much as $518 billion in assets in
the next decade because it’s still building dirty blast furnaces, according to a report by
Global Energy Monitor. Due to pledges to lower emissions, coal-powered blast
furnaces could become unnecessary or inoperable.

France/ Energy financing
Crédit Agricole, France’s second-biggest listed bank, will cut financing to highly
polluting industries and will expand services and investment for renewable forms of
energy. Emissions produced in the oil and gas sector and financed by Crédit Agricole
are planned to fall 30% by 2030.

Germany/ Coal power
The government will pass emergency laws to reopen idle coal plants for electricity
generation. This measure is a reaction to Russia’s 60% capacity cut on its main gas
pipeline. “This is bitter but in this situation it’s essential to lower the use of gas,” said
German economic minister Robert Habeck.

Philippines/ Renewable power
Vivant Corp. will invest $557 million in renewable energy in the next five years. The
company is developing nearly 600 MW of renewables capacity, including solar farms
(212 MW), wind (196 MW), solar rooftop (129 MW) and hybrid projects (62 MW).

Russia/ Arctic gas
Baker Hughes will halt engineering services to Russia’s energy sector, which will
impact that country’s Arctic energy projects. The company will also stop deliveries of
equipment. Without the services and equipment provided by Baker Hughes, projects
such as Yamal LNG and the Arctic LNG 2 will soon run into trouble.

U.S./ Natural gas
Cheniere Energy, the biggest U.S. gas exporter, will expand its facility in Corpus
Christi (Texas), boosting capacity more than 20% by late 2025. This will add 10 million
tons a year of liquefaction capacity on top of its current 45 million tons. Total U.S.
capacity is roughly 100 million tons.

U.S./ Solar power
The Solar Buyer Consortium, which includes Clearway Energy Group, Cypress Creek
Renewables and DE Shaw Renewable Investments, will spend about $6 billion to
support expansion of the domestic solar panel supply chain. The long-term plan calls
for supplying up to 7 GW of solar modules each year starting in 2024.
