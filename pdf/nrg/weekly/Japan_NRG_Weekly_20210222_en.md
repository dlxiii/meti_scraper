Electric vehicles close price gap with gasoline competitors

(Nikkan Jidosha Shimbun, Feb. 19)
•  Tesla reduced the price of its entry level Model 3 by ¥820,000, placing the car on a par with luxury
gasoline sedans. When the Environment Ministry’s subsidy is added the Model 3’s effective retail
price is around ¥3.5 million, which is significantly less than a Mercedes C class.
•  Meanwhile, Japan’s Idemitsu Kosan has branched into the compact electric vehicle market as well,
and aims to sell compact cars for between ¥1 and ¥1.5 million.
•  In the past, the high cost of electric vehicles stymied their uptake. Now, however, more

competitive pricing combined with government sanctions looks set to make electric cars
competitive with their petrol counterparts.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Idemitsu to develop electric car priced below ¥1.5 million
•  (Sanyo News, Feb. 16)
o  Idemitsu Kosan announced on Feb. 16 that it was entering the electric vehicle market.
o  Co. will unveil its EV in October, to go on sale next year.

o  The micro-sized vehicle is aimed at elderly and inexperienced drivers, and will have a
maximum speed of 60 km/h. The vehicle will be able to travel 120 km on an eight hour
charge.
o  The vehicles will be displayed at Idemitsu service stations around the country.
o  Idemitsu hopes that revenue from EVs will help offset the projected fall in gasoline sales.




Japan mulls switching gasoline for synthetic fuels made from hydrogen in clean tech push
(Nikkei, Feb. 19)
•  The govt. will consider the possibility of commercializing a fuel that is made by synthesizing CO2
with hydrogen, believing that in time it can become cheaper than oil-based fuels like gasoline.
•  Synthetic fuel is manufactured by reusing CO2 emitted from factories and power plants. Although
CO2 is emitted during driving, it can be reduced close to zero by offsetting the amount taken in

during manufacturing.
•  Although Japan announced a ban on new gasoline-engine car sales from 2035, a large number of
gasoline vehicles will remain on the road for years to come.
•  The new synthetic fuel could be cheaper than gasoline by around 2050, in the government’s
preliminary estimate.




Nippon Steel to close furnace, cut capacity in effort to reduce emissions
(Nikkei, Feb. 18)
•  Nippon Steel plans to stop production at a blast furnace at one of its factories near Tokyo, the
Nikkei reported. Together with earlier decisions, this will cut domestic capacity by 20%.

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  One reason is domestic overcapacity and sluggish demand for pipes used in shipbuilding and in
the oil and gas industry. However, the Co. faces pressure to reduce its use of blast furnaces, which
emit large amounts of carbon emissions.
•  The closure will take place within several years.
•  CONTEXT: Blast furnaces use coal-based coke for combustion and emit a large amount of CO2.

The steel industry is Japan’s top emitter after the power generation plants. Nippon Steel’s use of
blast furnaces for steelmaking makes it hard for the company to decarbonize.



Taiheiyo Cement to employ its tech for lithium-ion batteries to speed up EV charging

(Nikkei, Feb. 19)
•  Taiheiyo Cement plans to use its technology to produce a new cathode material that is just 100
nanometers in diameter and which can be made without nickel or cobalt. This will improve lithium
ions flow, which in turn helps batteries used in EVs charge faster.
•  The technology should also triple the usable life of EV batteries, according to the Co.
•  Taiheiyo will invest ¥1 billion ($9.4 million) in a demonstration plant, which should come online in

fiscal 2021. The plant will produce annually 100 tons of the electrode material. Mass-production is
expected as early as 2025.



Taisei to make concrete with CO2 drawn from the atmosphere
(Nikkei, Feb. 15)
•  Taisei, a construction company, has developed a technology that captures atmospheric CO2 and

uses it to produce calcium carbonate, which is a compound of CO2 and calcium. The compound is
then turned into cement.
•  This new method significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions by capturing up to 170 kg of
CO2 per cubic meter of concrete produced.
•  The new process also emissions some CO2, but the extraction of the gas from the air during the
production process should make the net amount negative, according to Co. calculations.
•  Idemitsu, Ube Industries and JGC Holdings are involved in refining the new method and bringing

down its cost.
•  If all of Japan’s concrete production moved to the new method, the industry’s CO2 emissions are
estimated to fall by as much as 430,000 kg.
•  CONTEXT: Cement production is one of the most CO2-intensive industrial processes in the world.




Itochu to sell Colombia mine that accounts for 80% of coal business, fully exit coal by 2024
(Fuji Sankei Business, Feb. 19)
•  Major Japanese trading companies are scrambling to divest from the coal industry, with Itochu
Corp the latest to sell the majority of its interests in thermal coal to meet environmental, social, and
governance (ESG) goals.

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Itochu plans to sell its interests in a Colombian coal mine before the end of the financial year.
Producing 6.2 million metric tons of coal per year, the mine accounts for 80% of Itochu’s coal
business.
•  The remaining 20% comprises interests in two Australian coal mines, which Itochu plans to sell by

the end of 2023/24.
•  While Japan’s trading companies strategically lowered their exposure to energy and mining in
response to the 2015 market crash, mining operations (including both coal and precious metals)
still contribute significantly to their revenue. Trading companies are now hurrying to find an
alternative source of income.



Mitsubishi Heavy invests in U.S. startup that had developed tech to produce carbon-free

hydrogen from natural gas
(Company statement, Feb. 10)
• Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) today announced that it has invested in C-Zero, a hard
tech startup located in Santa Barbara, Calif., to accelerate the first commercial-scale deployment
of C-Zero's drop-in decarbonization technology, which will allow industrial natural gas consumers
to avoid producing CO in applications like electrical generation, process heating and the
2
production of commodity chemicals like hydrogen and ammonia.
• C-Zero's technology uses innovative thermocatalysis to split methane – the primary molecule in
natural gas – into hydrogen and solid carbon in a process known as methane pyrolysis. The
hydrogen can be used to help decarbonize a wide array of existing applications, including
hydrogen production for fuel cell vehicles, while the carbon can be permanently sequestered.
When renewable natural gas is used as the feedstock, C-Zero's technology can even be carbon
negative, effectively extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently storing it in
the form of high-density solid carbon.
• Hydrogen produced via methane pyrolysis processes like C-Zero's is increasingly referred to as
"turquoise hydrogen," as it combines the benefits of both "blue hydrogen," (SMR with
CO sequestration) and "green hydrogen" (produced by splitting water via electrolysis) with its
2
low cost and low emissions, respectively.

ENEOS to install hydrogen pumps at existing gas stations from 2022

(Asia Nikkei, Feb. 14)
•  Japan’s top oil supplier, ENEOS, will start adding hydrogen pumps to its gas station network
across the country from spring 2022.
•  The company has 13,000 stations in the country, and it will trial the plan at two stations - one in
Kanagawa and one in Aichi prefectures.
•  The move comes after METI relaxed measures for hydrogen pumps in January 2020, allowing them

to be added even at downtown gas stations. The government will also provide ¥11 billion ($105
million) in the next fiscal year budget to companies building hydrogen stations.
•  Iwatani, the biggest hydrogen producer in Japan, is also building six hydrogen filling stations
around the country.

Marubeni and Mizuho Leasing ship first zero-emission refrigerated trailer
(New Energy Business News, Feb. 15)
•  US-based rental service PLM Fleet LLC, which is partially owned by both Marubeni and the Mizuho
Leasing Company, has begun shipping zero emission refrigerated trailer units.
•  The units are designed and manufactured by Advanced Energy Machines and incorporate solar

panels, charging units, and chiller units.
•  Under an agency agreement with Advanced Energy Machines in 2020, PLM Machines has the
rights to market the trailer to the U.S. market.
•  Amidst increasing demand for zero emission technology, PLM’s client base is growing strongly.



TEPCO/Chubu Electric Power joint venture takes over vehicle recharging service

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 16)
•  E-Mobility Power, a joint venture between TEPCO Holdings and the Chubu Electric Power
Company, will take over the operations of Nippon Charge Service in April.
•  Nippon Charge Service (NCS), which provides charging services for electric vehicles and affiliated
services, was established in 2014 with the aim of promoting the uptake of EVs and plug-in hybrids.
NCS is partially owned by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, as well as TEPCO and the Chubu Electric

Power Company.
•  E-Mobility Power has aimed to absorb NCS since it was established in 2019. E-Mobility Power aims
to be an economical and accessible recharging service.

Court rules Japan government co-liable for Fukushima accident compensation
(Yomiuri Shimbun, Feb. 19)
•  The Tokyo High Court has awarded damages to former residents of Fukushima who were forced to
flee to Chiba after the 2011 nuclear disaster.
•  Overturning a previous judgement that found sole liability to rest with TEPCO, the Court ordered

both the government and TEPCO to pay compensation.
•  This is the third of 30 lawsuits against TEPCO to go to appeal.
• TAKEAWAY: The government is already paying money into TEPCO so that the company can pay the
compensation due to citizens and business entities. In fact, TEPCO was kept afloat as an entity after the
disaster partly out of the rationale that the company was needed to administer the payments. However, if the
liability is placed equally on the government, it opens the possibility of individuals and entities being able to

demand compensation from the state directly. Should that occur, it would at the very least put into question
the need for the government to funnel the funds into TEPCO. In a more extreme scenario, it puts under
question the rationale for keeping TEPCO as it is and may spur on an oft-rumored restructuring of the
electricity utility.




Fukushima says electricity supply to be 100% renewable by 2025

(Nikkei, Feb. 16)
•  Fukushima prefecture has set itself a target of generating 100% of its net electricity requirements
from renewable sources by 2025.
•  Fukushima erected dedicated transmission lines after the 2011 nuclear disaster using government
aid, and these have facilitated its transition to renewable electricity.
•  On paper, the prefecture will not have to rely at all on nuclear energy or fossil fuels after 2025.

Quake off the Fukushima coast shuts down power plants in the north-east
(Nikkei, Feb. 14)
•  CONTEXT: A 7.3 magnitude earthquake off the coast Fukushima prefecture late on Saturday night
(Feb. 13) and temporarily knocked power facilities offline, leaving close to 1 million households
without electricity for several hours.
•  A major earthquake centered off the coast of Fukushima on Feb. 13 forced Tohoku Electric and

JERA to shut down at least 10 power stations.
•  In addition to buying electricity from utilities in other regions, including 3.5 MW from TEPCO,
Tohoku Electric weathered the shortage by restarting unit two of its Higashi-Niigata thermal plant,
which had been idle.
•  Some affected facilities, including units five and six of JERA’s Hirono thermal power station, are
scheduled to be restarted on or after Feb. 15.
•  Some 860,000 Tohoku Electric Power subscribers momentarily lost power after the quake.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Fukushima: earthquake causes water to slop from reactor pool
(Sankei Biz, Feb. 16)
o  TEPCO says the Feb. 13 earthquake caused water to overflow from pools located on top
of Units 5 and 6 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear station.
o  TEPCO says it is not aware of any spilled water leaking out of the reactor buildings and

that there is no safety issue.



Mutsu officials say they never agreed to Kansai Electric’s nuclear waste idea
(Nikkei, Feb. 15)
•  In a statement the municipality of Mutsu in Aomori condemned a Kansai Electric (KEPCO) proposal

to Fukui Prefecture on Feb. 12 in which KEPCO would share access to the Mutsu nuclear waste
storage facility as an option to store its spent nuclear fuel in the future.
•  Mutsu never agreed to any such proposal, nor even discussed it, says the statement.
•  Categorically ruling out Mutsu as potential destination for KEPCO’s waste, the statement says that
Mutsu clearly told the Federation of Electric Power Companies that it would not engage in any
discussion that assumed the shared use of the storage facility was an option.
• TAKEAWAY: This could be a massive setback for Kansai Electric’s plans to restart as many as six reactors this

spring and summer. However, we don’t expect this is the end of the discussion. Added incentives and pressure
will try to persuade Mutsu to reconsider. The key, however, will be the reaction of the Fukui government to
Mutsu’s statement. Do they pretend as if it does not matter and allow Kansai Electric to restart its NPPs, or do
they dig in and demand an additional explanation from the utility? The next major pressure point from Kansai
region’s electric supply perspective will likely be in July and August, giving the utility about 5 months to
appease the Fukui government.

String of errors jeopardize restart of TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki nuclear plant
(Economist Online and NRA, Feb. 15-17)
•  While the restart of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant is vital for TEPCO’s economic

success, a spate of scandals looks likely to delay the restart.
•  The regulatory authorities completed their safety audit of Unit 7, but it was recently revealed that
an unauthorized worker entered the reactor’s control room in breach of security protocols. TEPCO
also erroneously announced in January the completion of work to enhance the reactor’s safety
when in fact it had not.
•  The Governor of Niigata Prefecture has criticized the series of blunders, which he says damage
confidence in TEPCO.
•  The NRA Commissioner said on Feb. 17 in remarks streamed by the nuclear regulator that TEPCO

should revise its current plan to load fuel into Unit 7 of the NPP.
•  Even Kashiwazaki Mayor, and nuclear power proponent Sakurai Masahiro, believe the scandal will
delay the restart date by several months.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO to hire 600 new employees in FY2021
(Okinawa Times, Feb. 19)

o  On Feb. 18, TEPCO announced its recruitment plans for the upcoming financial year, as
well as the following financial year.
o  The utility plans to hire 600 personnel (comprising 470 recent graduates and 130 mid-
career hires) in 2021/22. To contribute to the Fukushima prefecture rebuild, 45 of the
recent graduates will be from Fukushima.
o  TEPCO plans to hire a similar number of personnel in 2022/2023.




Daiwa Securities lose big with energy investment: Now holding smoking bomb due to
potential FSA investigation

(Sentaku, Feb. issue)
•  IDI Infrastructures (an energy fund in which Daiwa Securities and IDI each have 50% ownership) saw
its president ousted six months ago after a motion submitted by Araki Hideki (of Daiwa Securities),
one of the fund’s directors.
•  Many investors are indignant about this dismissal.
•  In ousting the former president, Saitama Koji, Daiwa Securities unwittingly informed regulatory
authorities about their risk assets, according to someone familiar with the matter.
•  IDI Infrastructures (who manage power giant F Power) have been pushing forward with

constructing a power plant that Daiwa is reluctant to support. Daiwa’s role in Saitama's dismissal
made clear the firm’s opposition to IDI, which wants shareholder contracts to be executed.
•  IDI is suing Daiwa’s Araki and Matsui for damages exceeding ¥300m.
•  Regardless of the lawsuit’s outcome, what is significant is the ¥50b impairment loss in the event of
IDI Infrastructures going bankrupt. Past investments have not been included on Daiwa’s books
because IDI Infrastructure is not consolidated even though it’s a Daiwa subsidiary.
•  Japan’s FSA have noticed this off-book risk asset and are considering examining the matter.

•  If consolidated, most of Daiwa’s net income of ¥32.8b for the first half of the fiscal year will go.

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  F Power (which is managed by IDI Infrastructures) has seen large losses since 2017 due to the
company failing to meet demand with its own power plants, which resulted in costs to procure
energy to meet that demand shooting up.
•  “Daiwa still has a culture of concealing ugly things and tried to scapegoat former-president

Saitama to resolve this issue”, according to one person familiar with the matter.



KEPCO trade union demands ¥3,000 increase in base pay
(Sankei Biz, Feb. 19)
•  On Feb. 18 the trade union for KEPCO employees demanded an across-the-board salary increase
of ¥3,000 per month for its members.
•  This is the fourth consecutive year that the union has demanded a pay rise.

•  The union says COVID-19 and increased competition has made things tough for its members, and
a pay rise is needed to boost morale.

Tokyo Gas CEO firm on decarbonization plans despite shareholder protests
(Nikkei, Feb. 16)
•  Tokyo Gas CEO Uchida has responded to the government’s new energy policy by announcing a

review of shareholder benefits in order to free up enough cash to finance the utility’s transition to
renewable energy. The company’s shares fell 5% on the announcement.
•  The gas utility had been known for its strong share price and generous dividends. The decision
prompted protests from shareholders worried that Tokyo Gas will no longer be able to compete
with shares of renewable energy companies.
•  CEO Uchida has stood firm on his plans to reform the company, however, saying that it is only a
matter of time before the move to decarbonize industry targets gas providers. If Tokyo Gas does

not change it will not survive, he says.

ANALYSIS

The future of oil & gas, and why the U.S. can dominate renewables:
An interview with Jarand Rystad, CEO and founder, Rystad Energy

Last week Japan NRG interviewed Jarand Rystad and Artem Abramov of Rystad
Energy to hear their views on recent developments in international energy markets.
Below is a selection of their comments.

Rystad believes that current recovery in oil prices is sustainable in the short-term and
may even feel stronger in a year as the impact of Covid-19 recedes and the
fundamentals more firmly support prices. Last year!s production cuts by Saudi Arabia
achieved their goal, although prices may fluctuate again after April as OPEC
production gradually comes back online.

Rystad sees the oil price possibly spiking in 2022 as vaccinations are rolled out more
broadly across the globe and international travel recovers.

In the short-term, the Biden administration!s policies could also be positive for oil
consumption as economic stimulus is enacted and rolled out. Longer-term, the
environment for the U.S. oil and gas industry will grow more challenging as the

climate agenda gains momentum and more of the country!s emphasis is placed on
renewable energy.

New Mexico may be the state most impacted by the moratorium on oil drilling on
federal lands. Sixty-five percent of drilling acreage in the state is on federally owned
lands. However, the negative impact on oil and natural gas production will be pushed
back for some years because many local developers have stockpiled leases prior to
the Nov. 3 election. Some companies accumulated more than 500 permits, enough to
keep the current pace of drilling for the next four to five years. Offshore Gulf of
Mexico oil leases will see a similarly negative impact in the mid-term for the same
reasons.
Tax incentives for the U.S. fossil fuel industry are also expected to be gradually
removed and the decarbonization of the power sector will be fast-tracked with the
2035 net-zero goal in place. This may be negative for smaller shale oil and gas
players, spurring more concentration among super-majors and the shale
independents. This situation could well turn out to be a positive for U.S. LNG exports
to Asia as domestic reliance on natural gas is reduced.

Rystad sees the current strategy of global oil and gas companies split into three
different approaches, largely delineated by geography. U.S. oil majors are
transitioning to new energy sources at a slower pace than their counterparts in Europe
or Asia. European oil majors including Total, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell have
announced ambitious plans to re-balance their portfolios and Asian NOCs (national oil
companies) and majors are reorienting toward natural gas. However, companies such
as Exxon and Chevron are expected to accelerate their transition in coming years and
may do so using acquisitions. Higher oil prices and significantly reduced capex will
strengthen their cashflow generation. U.S. majors may also feel that greening their
portfolios will be important in bolstering their share price, a key tool in M&A.

All oil and gas companies should accelerate carbon reduction strategies, including
carbon capture and storage, and direct air capture.

Disruptive technologies will become increasingly relevant. Rystad believes there will
be a complete international shift to EVs for transportation. Hydrogen will not be
competitive with EV technology for ground transportation but could be a strong
solution for aviation and shipping due to its high energy density. This may require a
redesign of aircraft fuselages and the creation of hydrogen hubs around airports.

The U.S. may be the best place to produce hydrogen and, as a whole should end up
being a renewable energy super-power. The country is blessed with the best natural
resources for the next-generation of energy technologies, including batteries,
according to Rystad.

For Japan, hydrogen and ammonia should create an important opportunity to
reorientate its energy policies and infrastructure, and build more energy self-
sufficiency.

Solar PV and battery technology are considered to be the most promising future
technologies. Batteries will be extensively used for transportation and for peak
electricity shaving and grid storage. Rystad believes nickel and iron phosphate will be
used more extensively for batteries in the future.

Covid-19 could continue to negatively impact energy consumption for a few more
months, with Rystad!s estimates of infections six times higher than the widely
accepted numbers published by John Hopkins University. Rystad believes the real
Covid-19 infection rate around the world is around 600 million people. John Hopkins
cites 110 million global infections, based on official government numbers from around
the world and media reports.

The pandemic's impact on business travel may be structural as company management
looks to get more done without extensive travel. This will have a long-term negative
impact on jet fuel consumption.

As for Japan, the country!s reliance on renewable energy will grow and scale-up,
particularly in wind energy. Japan has potential for 600 GW of wind power capacity
and more extensive use of solar in un-utilized hydro reservoirs and on low-income
farmland. Solar and wind should be natural hedges, and batteries should be more
extensively used for grid back-up. Nuclear assets should be maintained and re-
activated, but new nuclear may be uncompetitive.

Rystad Energy, founded in 2004, is an independent energy research and business
intelligence company, headquartered out of Oslo, Norway. It provides data, tools,
analytics and consultancy services to clients in the energy industry across the globe.
Rystad!s capabilities within energy fundamentals, oil and gas markets, supply chains,
renewables and energy transition facilitate their advisory work to clients enhancing
decision-making across the energy sector around the world. Having become a sought-
after voice in energy markets, Rystad is widely recognized for up-to-date, consistent

Myanmar Coup Leaves Japan’s Southeast Asia LNG and

Industrial Anchor Strategy in Turmoil

Japan potentially stands to lose out on a major energy and infrastructure market if the
U.S. and other jurisdictions strengthen their sanctions against Myanmar in response to
a military coup in the Southeast Asian nation earlier this month.

Despite the initial view from Japan that the coup will not disrupt Japanese
investments in Myanmar, the continuing escalation of the situation inside the country
threatens a wave of more international actions that will make it extremely complicated
to do business there. This places at risk not only Japan’s stake in one of Myanmar’s
biggest gas fields and a future $2 billion LNG-to-power facility, but also several
industrial complex developments and a big part of Japan’s strategy to develop the
Southeast Asia LNG supply chain.

The current U.S. sanctions targeting Myanmar may not have a direct immediate
impact on the energy sector there, because none of the sanctioned entities are in the
energy industry and all individuals were sanctioned in their private capacity. Also, the
current sanctions apply primary, albeit not exclusively, to U.S. persons. However, there
is a potential for further sanctions if the situation in Myanmar continues to escalate
and/or the military does not cede power to the elected officials.

The U.S. and other governments will be monitoring for signs that the domestic
situation is escalating into a violent crackdown of protests. According to media reports
over this weekend, at least two people have been killed in protests and the police
used live ammunition to disperse demonstrators. This indicates a high likelihood of
further international action.

So far, President Joe Biden’s Executive Order granted wide authority to the Office of
Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") of the U.S. Department of the Treasury for
implementing further sanctions targeting “the defense sector of the Burmese
economy or any other sector of the Burmese economy as may be determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State.”

From a historic perspective, prior U.S. sanctions targeted the Myanmar government
(and, thus, all SOEs) until 2012. The U.S. government could adopt a similar approach
by sanctioning the entire government of Myanmar or its specific ministries (e.g.
defense and/or energy). This would mean that entities owned 50% or more by one or
more of the targeted state bodies will also become sanctioned.

It is also possible that other jurisdictions (e.g. the UK and the EU) will implement their
own sanctions targeting Myanmar, which may be different from the U.S.
approach. This potential escalation would create a chilling effect, particularly on long-
term projects and/or any projects with governmental entities (such as Myanmar Oil
and Gas Enterprise).

Financial institutions will also add Myanmar to a “yellow flag” category, likely limiting
long-term financing options and U.S. dollar payment transactions related to Myanmar.

The U.S. Commerce Department has already announced preliminary export
restrictions against Myanmar, which may be expanded to include adding Myanmar
persons to the Entity List and/or adding Myanmar to the Military End-Use rule. The
current restrictions include a “presumption of denial” for U.S. export licenses to
certain Burmese government entities.

In addition, the Commerce Department has suspended certain license exceptions
previously available to Myanmar as a result of its current Country Group placement
under the Export Administration Regulations, including Shipments to Country Group B
countries (License Exception GBS) and Technology and Software under restriction
(License Exception TSR).

To put it simply, these export controls changes may impact any energy projects that
rely on U.S. technology or goods. This basically cuts off supply of certain key

equipment due to a sufficient proportion of the said equipment / components being
based on or incorporating U.S.-origin technology and/or software.

It is well known that U.S. technology is prevalent in the oil and gas industry, including
in the LNG supply chain. Also, oil on international markets trade in USD, creating a
further burden for Japanese investors in export-focused hydrocarbon projects in
Myanmar.

In summary, while current sanctions lack real bite, it would be prudent to prepare for
their escalation. For Japanese companies already involved or willing to consider
business in Myanmar, this will mean a review of contracts to make sure they allow for
risk mitigation, such as an ability to suspend or exit the venture entirely. These options
need to be contractually permitted specifically based on a sanctions-escalation
provision.

Despite the current events, Myanmar hasn’t closed for business. However, energy and
other investments in the country will now need to be stress-tested to see if they can
manage without the U.S. currency, financial institutions or technology. And that sets a
high bar for achieving Japan's energy business expansion in the Southeast Asian
country.

Nuclear Power in Asia: New Tech, New Markets, New Impetus
Keynote: Francois Morin, Director at the World Nuclear Association (WNA)
Date: Feb. 17, 2021

Access: Online webinar

Last week, Japan NRG hosted the first of its “Japan NRG Transition 2050” series of
online webinars. The virtual conference featured a keynote presentation by Francois
Morin, a director at the WNA, to discuss the outlook for nuclear power in China, South
Korea, and Taiwan. Mr. Morin is a French nuclear physicist with extensive experience
in the nuclear industry, including 15 years in China.

The event included 40+ participants from the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Australia.

The WNA mainly represents the nuclear manufacturing industry with over 200
members, including three Japanese members. Last October, Ms. Sama Bilbao y León,
a Spaniard, became the Director General of WNA. Previously, Ms. Bilbao y Leon was
Head of the Division of Nuclear Technology Development and Economics at the
OECD Nuclear Energy Agency.

WNA works closely with the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) and the
World Nuclear University that trains nuclear engineers.


PRESENTATION SUMMARY
The 50 GW (49 units) of nuclear power units that are currently in operation around
China currently generate around 290 TWh of power (equivalent to one third of
Japan’s electricity consumption).

China may overtake the U.S. by 2028 in terms of nameplate nuclear generation
capacity, exceeded 100 GW, becoming the world’s number one nuclear power
generator. WNA expects per capita power consumption in China to grow 60% by
2040 to 8,000 kWh/ capita.

China's nuclear power output may exceed Japan's total electricity output (approx.
1,000 TWh) before 2030.

Meeting power consumption and the 2060 decarbonization goal may ultimately
require the construction of 300 GW of nuclear capacity in China, including inland
construction. WNA’s reference scenario for China for 2040 is almost 180 units, almost
4x current capacity.

In three provinces Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, nuclear output has already
exceeded 20% of the electricity mix.

Last November, two new units at the Fuqing Plant, operated by CNNC, were
connected to the grid. Construction times have been brought below six years and the
costs per reactor are around $5 billion. The new reactors are now a fully Chinese
model, the Hualong, with 50% more steel and concrete than pre-Fukushima
construction, and 85% local content.

At another site, Tianwan, four Russian reactors, VVERs, have been constructed
alongside two Chinese reactors, ACPR1000s.

China’s ‘go-out’ strategy involves the government working with various countries
including India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Kenya, Argentina, among
others, on rolling out China’s nuclear technology.

WNA estimates that China could construct 8-10 reactors per year to meet national
and international demand.

China is also building out its fast breeder and SMR capabilities with sites currently
under construction in Fujian and Hainan, respectively.

Taiwan currently has two GE BWRs and two Westinghouse PWRs in operation on the
northern and southern tips of the island, but was scheduled to phase out nuclear by
2025 following the accident at Fukushima. There will be a referendum in August this
year to finally decide the matter.

South Korea has 24 reactors, all PWRs, built between 1983 and 2019. There was a
plan to build 13 new reactors prior to the last presidential election in 2017, which
would have taken the country’s nuclear share of electricity production to almost 30%.

President Moon, who won the election, campaigned on a policy of phasing out
nuclear power over 40 years. However, this is now being reconsidered and two new
reactors, at Ulchin, will be connected to the grid before May 2022. Two other reactors
may also be built at that site. The government also recently approved the continued
construction of Shin Kori reactors 5&6. South Korea recently successfully built four
reactors in the UAE on time and under budget.

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

The Texas Freeze:
Electricity, natural gas, and water utilities suffered catastrophic and cascading outages
across Texas last week as temperatures in the state approached -20 Celsius, a 126-
year low, due to frigid polar vortex weather conditions. Temperatures in Austin were
the lowest since 1909.
Over four million residents were without power and 14 million were without water.
Dozens of deaths have already been attributed to hypothermia and carbon monoxide
poisoning. President Biden will sign a major disaster declaration for Texas when he
visits over the next few days.
Economic damage is estimated to be at least $50 billion to the Texan economy which
is worth almost $2 trillion. RWE, Germany’s largest power producer, which operates in
the state, may suffer losses of $500 million due to the disruptions in Texas. General
Motors and Ford also cut back production in Texas.
Outages impacted four million barrels of U.S. oil production capacity, 20% of U.S.
refinery capacity, and 40% of Texan gas production. All of Conoco’s Permian and
Eagle Ford shale oil output was halted. Natural gas prices at the Houston ship channel
approached $400 mmbtu last week. Natural gas is used for electricity and heating
across Texas aggravating the demand pressures.
Electricity prices were $9 kWh last week which is equivalent in energy terms to a
$15,000 price per barrel of oil. The pre-Freeze power prices were 5 cents per kWh. A
full Tesla charge would have cost $900 in Texas last week.
Power demand peaked as supply collapsed with over 30 GW of power generation
assets disabled. Nuclear, coal, gas, wind, and solar generation assets were all
impacted by the freeze. Gas pipelines into Mexico were also frozen, with efforts made
to replace piped gas with LNG until the governor banned all LNG exports from Texas
until yesterday. ERCOT, the local grid operator, is likely to be subject to a major
investigation as scenario planning appears to have been deficient. Some are
describing it as a ‘total failure’ of the Texas electricity infrastructure. The Texan grid is
an electricity ‘island’.
Over 1,000 public water systems also suffered disruptions across the state.

Oil:
1). OPEC revised up demand for OPEC crude for 2021 by 0.3 mb/d from the previous
month to stand at 27.5 mb/d, around 5.0 mb/d higher than in 2020.
2). JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are now both predicting a super-cycle for oil once
the pandemic abates.
3). Saudi Arabia is widely expected to reverse production cuts at next OPEC meeting.

Natural Gas:
EIA now predicts that annual U.S. LNG exports will exceed pipeline exports in 2022
and that natural gas will account for about 36% of U.S. electricity generation by 2050.

Pipelines:
The U.S. government has commenced a new sanctions-related review of the Nord
Stream 2 natural gas pipeline that will link Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine.

Offshore Wind:
IEA projects that the annual offshore wind market is set to more than double in the
next five years thanks to rapid cost declines supporting expansion in Asia and the U.S.

Metals:
Copper prices rose to their highest level since 2011 on Friday, to almost $9,000 a ton.
Nickel hit its highest level since 2014, and aluminum hit its highest level since 2018.
Tin prices have hit a seven-year high with prices at $23,400 per ton.

ESG:
European funds investing in specific ESG themes are now thought to exceed $1.3
trillion, with over 500 new funds launched in 2020.

EVs:
Ford will stop selling cars with ICE engines in Europe by 2030.

Shipping:
AP Moeller-Maersk will launch the first carbon-neutral container vessel by 2023, seven
years ahead of schedule.

Air Travel:
1). IATA is reporting that flights in European airspace in February are at their lowest
level in a single year.
2). Airbus announced losses of $1.2 billion for FY2020 and may cut 15,000 jobs.
3). Air France-KLM announced a loss of $8.5 billion for FY2020 and will need to apply
for an additional round of state aid.
4). Two Board members of Boeing will step down, Susan Schwab and Arthur Collins.

Climate:
1). IEA believes that more work is needed to reduce emissions in chemicals, steel and
cement as the huge amount of energy needed to produce them has serious
implications for emissions. Steel production alone is thought to account for 9% of
global CO2 emissions.
2). The U.S. Federal Reserve announced it will ramp up oversight work to ensure the
U.S. financial system can deal with climate risks.

Covid ‘19:
Swiss Re announced business interruption claims of almost $4 billion for FY2020,
resulting in a loss of $900 million.

China:
1). China is looking at new limits on exports of 17 rare metals where it controls 80% of
global supply. This could impact EV and wind turbine production.
2). Jinko Solar announced a strategic cooperation agreement with Tongwei to build a
high-purity crystalline silicone project with a capacity of 45,000 tons and a silicon
wafer project of 15GW a year.

South Korea:
1). Last week the government passed the world’s first hydrogen law that outlines an
infrastructure for a hydrogen economy.

2). A legal dispute between LG Chem and SK Innovation over trade secrets relating to
battery production is impacting a production facility in Georgia, U.S. that could affect
the EV rollout for the U.S. auto industry.

Singapore:
The government just released the ‘Singapore Green Plan 2030’, which is the blueprint
for transitioning infrastructure to a more sustainable future over the next decade.

Indonesia:
1). IEA conducted a broad discussion with Indonesian energy officials on energy
strategies.
2). Indonesia has picked Ridha Wirakusuah of Bank Permata to be the new head of its
multi-billion sovereign wealth fund.

India:
1). Tesla is slated to start producing EVs in a suburb of Bangalore in 2021.
2). Disha Ravi, a climate activist, was arrested last week for sedition and could face life
in prison.

Iran:
Iran will halt all IAEA independent inspections of its nuclear facilities from Feb. 23 in a
clear break with the JCPOA agreement, unless international sanctions are lifted. The
head of the IAEA has offered to visit Iran.

Georgia:
Block Energy commenced gas sales from its West Rustavi field last week.

Africa:
1). France’s President Macron has indicated a possible future withdrawal of French
forces from the Sahel.
2). South Africa’s utility Eskom is moving forward with plans to close 25% of its coal
capacity by 2030.

France
1). The French government has cancelled plans for a major $11 billion expansion of
the Charles de Gaulle Airport due to environmental and climate concerns.
2). Renault announced a loss of almost $10 billion for FY2020.
