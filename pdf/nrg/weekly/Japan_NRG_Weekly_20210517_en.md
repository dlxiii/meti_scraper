NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Japan needs to pursue several energy mix scenarios amid uncertainty

(Japan NRG, May 13)
•  The Energy Basic Policy Subcommittee met to discuss potential energy mix options for Japan. The
panel’s main recommendation was to choose several scenarios and think through the potential
cost and resource implications for them.
•  Knowing that these inputs may change over time, Japan should move forward with several
scenarios to give room for maneuver, the panel said, pointing to a similar multiple-scenario
approach in the EU and UK.
•  While 100% renewable is among those scenarios, a presentation by the RITE institute suggested

that it’s not feasible in Japan due to the major jump in electricity costs that it would involve. Cost
of raw materials, and lack of available land and sea areas were listed among the factors.
•  The 100% renewables scenario would necessitate the addition of capacity that can generate
around 300 TWh, which is would be increase of 40% on Japan’s current network. If that new
volume were to be achieved in equal measures by solar and wind, Japan would need to add about
110 GW of solar (to generate 130 TWh of electricity). That would mean each of Japan’s 1,700

cities, towns and villages would have to secure an average of 65 sites, according to RITE
calculations.
•  For wind, the renewables-only scenario would require an additional 45 GW of offshore wind
capacity to be installed by 2040, according to RITE.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Electricity costs to double or even quadruple if renewables more than 50% of the energy mix

(TV Asahi, May 14)
o  The TV report cited the above-mentioned Energy Basic Policy panel meeting in a news
item that led with the mention of what the impact on electricity prices would be from
having renewable energy provide at least 50% (or all) of Japan’s power.
o  The news report noted that costs would double with renewables at 54% of the mix and
nuclear power at 10%. If all of the electricity came from renewable sources, the costs
covering storage batteries and new power transmission lines would push the price of

electricity up by a factor of four.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Solar installation pace could not keep pace with emission cuts targets
(CRIEPI Discussions paper, May 14)
o  CONTEXT: The Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) is one of the
most authoritative voices in the electricity industry in Japan. It put out a discussion paper

looking at Prime Minister Suga’s 46% emissions reduction by FY2030 goal.
o  The institute said it examined renewable energy and PV in particular, and found that the
feasibility of reducing the nation’s emission with more solar by FY2030 is low.
o  The institute calculated what it would take to cut 810 million tons of CO2 equivalent from
emissions and said this would require the introduction of at least 15 GW of solar a year
for 10 straight years, which is 50% more than the nation has managed to ever install
within 12 months.

| approach in the EU and UK. |

o  “It is difficult to image the construction facility” stretching to this kind of level, according
to CRIEPI.
• TAKEAWAY: With PM Suga’s 46% announcement, the already heated debate on the future of Japan’s energy
mix has become even more intense. In the coming weeks, all the industry heavyweight institutes, think tanks,
lobby groups and more will be putting out their thoughts on what energy strategy the country should take.

Everyone will hope to have some influence on METI’s energy mix that the ministry is due to publish in early
summer. Japan NRG offered our vision of the paths Japan could take to reduce emissions in the May 10
edition.
• The intensity of the debate, and uncertainty of the numbers on all sides, however, is leading Japan NRG to

believe that the country will for the first time announce several scenarios, or at the very least leave the main
scenario open to adjustments. For one, the contribution from nuclear energy is an intangible that the
government cannot seem to control.

• We believe the government ideally wants to have various energy sources compete for survival and supremacy
over the next decade, and may encourage all sides of the energy spectrum for now.



Renewables may be allocated 36-38% of the power mix in new Basic Energy Plan

(Kyodo, NHK, May 11-15)
•  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry plans to announce a new environmental target
whereby Japan will aim to generate 36 to 38% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by
2030.
•  This is a significant increase from the current target of 20 to 24%, and reflects the government’s
recent pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 46% by 2030.
•  Once finalized, the target will form the basis for METI’s revised mid-to long-term Energy Basic
Plan.
•  The current version of the plan has renewables at 22% to 24% of the total, with nuclear set aside

20% to 22% and thermal power at 56%.
•  The new 46% emissions reduction target for FY2030 inevitably means increasing the reliance on
renewables and METI believes high 30s percentage is the best proportion.
•  Nuclear is likely to remain at the same level in the revised energy plan, while thermal power’s
component will drop to about 40%.
•  METI aims to present a draft of the new plan next month and is coordinating with related ministries

and companies to make sure a final decision can be made this summer.
•  METI is aware that promoting large scale solar will be tricky given the lack of available land in
Japan and the feasibility of nuclear energy meeting its expected range is also under question.



Renewables expected to share cost of power transmission upgrades from 2023

(Japan NRG, May 12)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission held its latest meeting on May 12. At the
meeting, it was suggested to reform the electricity consignment (transmission) fee structure.
•  As a result, renewable energy project operators will start to share in the costs of the transmission
system from FY2023.

5


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Currently, electricity retailers pay the full consignment fee based on the rationale that end-users
benefit from interconnections of multiple power generators
•  The new scheme will see generation companies cover 10% of the fee, and the retailers 90%. This
cost sharing is expected to improve the cost awareness of renewables and generate stable income
to be used to upgrade the grid.

•  The same payment rate will be applied across all energy types.
•  The commission has proposed setting the initial fee at ¥41,000/kW plus running fees, which would
combine fixed fees based on capacity (kW) with variable fees based on power volume (kWh).
Currently, only capacity is taken into consideration.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan NRG from Feb. 1, 2021 carried a detailed analysis of how the grid funding model is
changing and why. In short, the growing renewables component of the electricity mix requires a more flexible,

complex and updated transmission system. For example, the flow of power is no longer uni-directional. The
debate on this issue for the last six months has centered on how to apply payment to power generators on a
fair basis since the utilization rates of many renewables projects are lower than for thermal power. Creating a
payment based on both capacity and volume is the compromise that the market watchdog is proposing. We
expect there’ll be further dialog with industry on this matter but a final decision is likely in the coming months.




Is it agriculture’s turn to go carbon neutral?
(Mainichi Shimbun, May 11)
•  On May, 11, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a new mid-to long-term
strategy that calls for zero agricultural CO2 emissions by 2050 and an increase in the use of
environmentally friendly fertilizers and pesticides.
•  The strategy also calls for a 25% increase in organic farms by 2050, to reduce chemical fertilizer

use.
•  The ambitious nature of the targets means that considerable technological innovation and the
cooperation of farmers will be essential if the government is to have a hope of achieving them.



Housing sector cooperation essential if Japan to hit carbon targets, says Koizumi

(Nikkei X-tech, March 12)
•  Environment Minister Koizumi Shinichiro says that despite the global movement to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, Japanese industry and consumers continue to take a “business as
usual” attitude to the environment, leaving the nation out on its own. This concerns him and has
made him such a vocal advocate of carbon neutrality, he says.
•  While 2050 may seem like a long way off, whether we can halt global warming comes down to
what we do in the next 5 to 10 years, says Koizumi.
•  Koizumi has consistently identified electric vehicles, housing and renewable energy as the three

pillars of decarbonization. He says around 60% of consumers’ CO2 emissions are determined by
their lifestyles—specifically, what they eat, how they travel, and, most importantly, where they live.
•  By insulating their homes, consumers are able to not only reduce their environmental impact but
also save money, says Koizumi. Living in a well-insulated home also has health benefits.
•  Many dwellings in Japan do not meet the standards set forth in the WHO’s 2018 housing and
health guidelines, namely that the indoor temperature should not fall below 18°C in winter.

•  Japan also lacks a mandatory performance labelling system for residential dwellings. There is a
need for Japan to implement such regulations, and also promote “net zero energy” (ZEH) housing,
says Koizumi.
• TAKEAWAY: Decarbonization in housing is going to be a major part of the government’s push to cut
emissions. This is an oft-overlooked area, but it has potential for considerable CO2 reductions since it utilizes a

lot of cement and steel, and sets the tone for choosing non-fossil-fuel power supply. Bureaucrats in Japan see
the ZEH program as a way to have the public participate and feel the impact of decarbonization. As such, METI
is opening to the public its next May 19 meeting of the Panel to Consider How to Achieve Carbon Neutrality in
the Housing and Construction Sector. The panel’s ideas delivered at its recent meeting include promoting
lifestyle changes at a personal level, growing trees to absorb carbon, and improving housing stock utilization.




Amazon in talks to procure renewable energy in Japan via own wind and solar farms
(Nikkei, May 13)
•  Multiple sources have confirmed that Amazon is considering constructing its own wind and solar
farms in Japan to supply its seven data centers with electricity.
•  The retailer is already in talks with trading companies and electricity utilities.
•  One of the trading companies approached is bidding to build a wind farm off the coast of Akita. If

successful, the electricity generated by that wind farm could go to Amazon.
•  While Japan’s data centers consumed around 10 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2005, this is
projected to reach 20 TWh by 2030. Amazon aims to switch all its data centers across the globe to
renewably-generated electricity by 2025.


TDK forms alliance with Chinese lithium battery manufacture
(Kankyo Business, May 10)
•  TDK entered into an alliance with Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex

Technology Ltd (CATL). The deal involves cross licensing agreements and the two corporations will
establish a joint venture.
•  TDK says the joint venture will pool the two corporations’ expertise in rechargeable battery
technology and focus on the development, manufacture and sale of batteries for residential power
storage systems, electric motorcycles, and other mid-size rechargeable battery applications.




ENEOS and Toyota agree to use hydrogen in concept city

of FY2021.



Mitsui OSK Lines mulls introduction of hydrogen powered cargo cranes
(New Energy Business News, May 11)
•  A subsidiary of Mitsui OSK ordered a “near zero-emission” rubber tired gantry crane, developed

by Mitsui E&S Machinery, for introduction into service in Kobe in May 2022.
•  By using a smaller diesel engine, the new crane is able to cut emissions by up to 30%.
•  The move is part of an agreement between Mitsui OSK Lines and Mitsui E&S Machinery to
investigate the possibility of converting wharf-side cargo loading equipment to hydrogen.
•  The crane’s diesel engine is able to be replaced with a hydrogen fuel cell once suitable
infrastructure becomes available.

Japan’s power supply-demand expected to be tightest in years this summer
(NHK, May 14)
•  METI ministry Kajiyama said the power supply-demand situation this summer will be the toughest
in years.
•  As the country plans to withdraw slowly from thermal generation, there will be less predictability in

supply other that in areas such as Hokkaido and Okinawa (which will continue to rely heavily on
thermal power sources).
•  Industry regulator OCCTO expects the extra generation capacity held in reserve to drop to as low
as 3.7% of total in most areas of the country. That is close to what is considered the bare minimum
required for reserve capacity.
•  Japan’s summer is expected to be warmer than usual this year.
•  Ministry Kajiyama appealed to businesses and households to be efficient in their use of electricity.

•  The stability of supply is expected to become worse in the winter of this calendar year, especially
in the Tokyo area where TEPCO is the dominant power provider.
• TAKEAWAY: The weather patterns of recent years in Japan have been more and more unusual. Last year’s
rainy season lasted an almost record number of weeks. This year, it sems to be starting early. This makes
forecasting supply and demand more complicated, and adds to the difficulties that Japan’s power grid will
have in balancing greater variable renewable energy loads with thermal capacity against demand. Irrespective

of energy source preferences, all this points to a more urgent need for Japan to invest in an upgrade of its
transmission system and add more sophisticated tools to regulate market balance. Several ministry panels are
also working through the issue. Demand for power storage and VPP business models is sure to be high.

More carbon credit supply needed to grow C-neutral LNG business: JOGMEC
(Gas Energy News Co, May 10)
•  CONTEXT: This is an interview with Shirakawa Yutaka, a former Tokyo Gas executive who joined
state-backed Japan Petroleum and Natural Gas and Metal Mineral Resources Organization

(JOGMEC) in 2019 and now is a research in their LNG information and analysis team.
•  Shirakawa notes that the commercialization of carbon-neutral LNG has very much begin in Japan,
with Tokyo Gas now joined by Hokkaido Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho Gas in the sales of the product.
•  Problems to further developments of the C-neutral LNG industry include the lack of unified
methodology for calculating emissions and the lack of credit offsets.
•  Forestry offset programs around the world can maybe amount 1 to 5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent
per year, but the amount of CO2 emitted from the LNG supply chain was 1 billion tons last year.

There are many needs for offsets other than for LNG, so there is a risk that prices for offsets will
jump.
•  Shirakawa notes that the cost of carbon offsetting using a reforestation project is estimated to be
about $ 0.60 / mmbtu. However, the EU’s European Methane Strategy launched last year bans or
imposes a penalty on import of natural gas / LNG whose anthropogenic methane emissions
exceed a certain standard value. So, if methane emissions are also offset, the total cost would to
rise to around $ 0.75.
•  CONTEXT: That’s getting close to a tenth of the LNG price, which is currently trading in the $8 -

$10 range.
•  Shirakawa also notes how difficult it is to reduce methane emissions from smaller shale fields, as
opposed to large gas fields in places like Qatar. He expressed hope for the introduction of CCS as
a way to cut emissions in upstream, with carbon credits offsetting the CO2 from the mid to
downstream.

ENEOS to exit the coal business
(Denki Shimbun, May 12)
•  ENEOS Holdings will withdraw from the coal business. The company will first sell its upstream
assets you hold.

•  If domestic (Japanese) buyers of coal agree, ENEOS will also stop the sale of coal, President Ota
said, citing the major trends in environmental protection.



INPEX sues JGC Holdings over cost overruns at the Ichthys LNG project

(Jiji, Company Statements, May 12)
•  INPEX has filed a lawsuit against JGC Holdings’ subsidiary, JGC Global, at the Yokohama District
Court, seeking the performance of guarantees made in relation to the Ichthys LNG project in
Australia.
•  INPEX claims JGC and its affiliates agreed to reimburse INPEX for AU$758 million in settlements
paid to project contractors, but failed to do so.
•  JGC, Chiyoda Corp. and KBR Inc. of the U.S. were responsible for the contract, working via a joint
entity called JKC Australia LNG.

•  INPEX said that as part of the dispute with subcontractors of JKC Australia, it agreed to pay JKC
AU$757.73 million. Based on a deed agreement, JKC was then supposed to forward the money to
its subcontractors to facilitate project completion and repay the full amount to INPEX by Dec. 31,
2020.
•  As the repayment to INPEX was not made, the parties are now in a court dispute.
•  JGC acknowledged the lawsuit, and said that in the course of the project, the subcontractors

requested an additional sum of AU$757.73 million. After its payment, a dispute arose between
INPEX and JKC Australia and arbitration is ongoing in Singapore.
•  JKC Australia is refusing to make the payment to INPEX claiming that the correct settlement
procedures under the deed agreement were not followed.
•  JGC owns 40% of JKC Australia. KBR and Chiyoda each hold 30%.
• TAKEAWAY: This is an unusual situation to have Japanese companies taken to court to resolve such matters. It
indicates how difficult the vast Ichthys development was for INPEX – its maiden lead investment into a new

LNG project – and how expensive and over-budget the facility became. Perhaps, this also indicates that INPEX
is not rushing to develop any other major asset, such as its Abadi LNG project in Indonesia.



INPEX chief pledges to diversify portfolio, grow hydrogen, renewables

(Toyo Keizai, May 7)
•  INPEX CEO Ueda Takayuki says he agrees with criticism that his firm is overly reliant on the Ichthys
LNG project. He says it would only take an accident at Ichthys to jeopardize INPEX’s bottom line,
which is why the company is also investing in the Abadi project in Indonesia.
•  Ueda defends INPEX’s continued focus on LNG, which he says is relatively environmentally friendly
as it has a much lower carbon footprint than coal or oil. The firm will continue to increase its focus
on LNG while reducing the percentage of its business that is based on oil.

Electricity Grid Access Due to Open Up in FY2022,
Giving Renewable Energy Projects More Opportunities

Japan has promised renewables operators preferential access to the grid in a bid to
boost green energy in the mix. Currently, some solar and wind operators may settle
for regular access instead of the usual curtailments their power facilities face.

During Golden Week holidays at the start of this month, sunny weather increased
potential solar output even as power demand waned. And yet, the southern Kyushu
area asked solar facilities to curtail supply six times. Even the northern Hokkaido area
threatened curtailments for renewables projects before cloudy weather naturally
lowered solar output. In the same period, nationwide online gas-fired capacity was
largely unchanged while coal-fired capacity shrunk only about 10%.

Last week, a METI panel admitted that if all the solar farms seeking to connect to the
grid were allowed to do so, in Kyushu area alone 30% of renewable capacity would be
regularly curtailed. The panel’s message was: this is why it doesn’t make sense to
connect all comers to the grid.

Change, however, is on its way. Starting in FY2022, access to the power grid is due to
move to a merit-based order, with ‘merit’ defined in part by the environmental impact
of the generating power source. The volume of spare capacity in a power grid will also
be calculated in a different way, which should offer room for more renewables.

This will mark a profound change in Japan’s electricity markets, not only because it
should ease solar and wind power access to the grid, but because it could uproot the
entire hierarchy and structure of the industry.


Years of delays
In addition to operating most of Japan’s thermal power generation, the 10 regional
Electric Power Companies (EPCos) also handle grid access requests from third-parties.
Once connected, third party operators (many of which run solar or wind farms) are at
the mercy of the EPCo-owned grid company, which can ask them to stop operating
on days when supply exceeds demand.

“Connecting to the transmission network has been a bottleneck for renewables. One
concern is after you connect, a request can come asking you to curb power output,
and then it’s the same as being told you cannot connect” to the grid, says an official
for the Renewable Energy Association for Sustainable Power Supply (REASP).

Kyushu EPCo, operating on the southern island of Kyushu, made 26 curtailment
requests in FY2018. That jumped to 93 requests in FY2019, and 87 in FY2020. On a
few days, such as March 26, 2021, around half of the solar capacity in Kyushu was
curtailed.

A few of the power utilities like Shikoku EPCo and Tohoku EPCo claim they are trying
to keep renewables online longer and sometime disconnecting thermal power first.

|  |

Shikoku also utilize excess renewables output for pump storage and shares
information with renewables operators to improve communication.

These are small steps, however, and renewables projects claim their output is still
being constrained by a grid working to protect thermal power.

A common refrain from the EPCos is that they cannot allow new grid connections
because there is no spare capacity in the system after taking account of the power
stations that utilities need to keep in active reserve. This becomes even more
problematic in regions like Hokkaido where renewables capacity already exceeds the
region’s average demand capacity.

To make grid access fairer, last year the government asked EPCos to split off their
transmission networks from their power plants business, which is mostly thermal and
nuclear. Many utilities, however, kept the power lines business inside the same
holding as their electricity generation assets, thus essentially retaining everything
under the same roof.

Regulation and policies have so far either condoned or ignored the potential conflicts
of interest, but a rule change could now make a difference.

Grid operators can conveniently decline new connections to the grid, or curtail
capacity, by claiming that the system has no room for additional power capacity.
Utilities use the “nameplate capacity” (or rated capacity) model to measure utilization
rates. This model factors in the capacity that EPCos hold back for emergencies.

Internationally, however, it’s more common to use a “power flow” model to estimate
capacity utilization.

In 2018, the Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of Transmissions Operators
(OCCTO) ran calculations based on both of the models and concluded that with the
power flow model, the volume of available capacity is 4% to 15% higher than with the
rated output capacity model.

Following the study, OCCTO urged EPCos to reassess their spare capacity based on
the power flow calculation. After a small trial, the scheme was approved and agreed
on for a nationwide rollout, which took place in January 2021.

The nationwide program will be activated in two phases, first for the trunk lines, and
then for local transmission lines in 2024. Trials of the latter started last month. TEPCO
Grid and New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)
are also conducting tests on interconnections between different grid systems.


New rules of grid engagement and new lines
Grid access rules will also be changing. Currently, connections are made on a first
come, first served basis. This means traditional thermal power plants have the
advantage. However, the government plans to introduce a “merit-order system”, in
which connection priority is determined by power generation costs, environmental
impact and other parameters.

The Federation of Electric Power Companies proposed to METI to launch the new
access rules in 2022.

Also, the government plans to add more transmission lines to improve the grid’s
flexibility. As of March 2021, the plan calls for adding another 665 kilometers of
transmission lines and 25,590 substations.

The additional grid lines are especially important for offshore wind. The government
aims to build at least 10GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 30 GW to 45 GW
by 2040. Of this, 80% of the generation capacity will be in the northern Hokkaido,
Akita and Aomori prefectures, as well as in the southern Kyushu region. That will
require long-distance transmission lines from the country’s tips to its central areas, like
Tokyo, Kansai, and Chubu, where most of the demand lies.

The OCCTO is proposing the introduction of the High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)
system, which is suited for moving electricity over distances of 500 km and more. A
cost analysis of this is under way, as it will require adding equipment that converts DC
to AC. So far, early estimates indicate that HVDC would be economically feasible if it
connected around 45 GW of capacity.

If Japan proceeds with the rollout of HVDC then it will also open opportunities for
many foreign firms because few local companies deal with the technology.


Conclusion
As Japan re-configures its future electricity mix strategy, it’s likely that renewables will
play an increasing role in the country’s 2030 market and beyond. To accommodate
them, the country will need to revamp its grid structure, and likely push through a
more coherent separation between the power generation and transmission assets of
legacy regional power utilities.

Opening up the grid and adding more transmission lines will enable easier and more
profitable operations for renewable energy generators, which in turn will spur more
green energy projects in Japan. Achieving this in the nearest future will be crucial now
that the country has pledged a 46% emissions cut by FY2030, as well as lower tariffs
for renewables by putting them onto a new Feed-In Premium (FIP) pricing model
starting in 2022.

Profit in the time of Covid:
How the Pandemic is Reflected in Japan’s Corporate Financials

Japan went into its first lockdown and state of emergency on April 7, 20201, almost at
the start of Fiscal Year 2020. In the last two weeks, most major Japanese players in the
significant energy and commodity space reported their FY2020 results.

The results were affected by commodity price volatility and the accelerated
decarbonization narrative, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, leading several key
players in Japan’s energy scene to post record losses and write-downs. And while the
broader Nikkei 225 stock index rose 60% during FY2020, many energy-related stocks
dropped as investors punished those slow to respond to the energy transition
narrative and closer scrutiny over the environmental footprint.

Below is a selection of interesting points from the financial results. Please note that all
the Yen-denominated figures have been converted to USD at a rate of ¥110 to $1.


Background: Commodity price volatility
Firstly, it should be noted that the Covid fiscal year saw the highest volatility in minerals and energy commodity prices in a
decade.

International oil prices lurched from mid-teens (and even posted a record, negative $37.63 / barrel of WTI on April 20,
2020) to reach mid $60s level in late March 2021. In Japan, this reaction was delayed by 1-2 months. The average price of
oil recorded at customs dropped to ¥16,527, or $22.40, per barrel in June 2020. That’s the lowest since 1999.

In LNG, the story was Asia LNG benchmarks shrank to a record low sub $2 / mmbtu level in May 2020, only to bounce
back and achieve a record high of $32.494 on Jan. 12, according to the S&P Global Platts JKM assessment.

Japan’s electricity prices had probably the wildest peak of all, jumping to middle figures in Dec. 2020 for only the second
time in two years, and then surging to ¥63.07 per kWh in January 2021 before dropping to ¥7.50 the following month.


Trading Companies
Sumitomo Corporation recorded its worst ever performance as it suspended a Nickel
project in Madagascar for a year and incurred large associated impairment charges.
The IPP power business in Australia and the rising cost of power infrastructure also
contributed to the record loss. As a result of the decarbonization trend, the company
vowed to exit all shale oil businesses in the U.S. and all coal projects by the end of
2040s. The firm is also closing its crude and fuel oil trading desks in Singapore.

Sumitomo expects the current bullish trend in commodities to continue this fiscal year.
Its oil forecast is 10% higher for this fiscal year, copper estimate is 18% higher, and
the expectations for coking coal and nickel are also up.


1 Japan registered its first Covid-19 case in January 2020, but the virus did not start to spread noticeably until late February to
early March.

Mitsubishi Corporation’s net profit slumped almost 70% YoY due to lower coking
coal prices, plummeting profits in LNG, and an impairment charge on its Lawson
investment. Mitsubishi is still Japan’s largest trading company by asset value.

Mitsubishi sees a strong recovery in the LNG market this year, and healthy gains in oil
and copper, but expects the market for coking coal and iron ore minerals to be largely
unchanged.

Mitsui, Itochu, and Marubeni all reported profits due mainly to higher iron ore prices,
although lower oil prices negatively impacted performances during the year.


Oil Companies/Refineries
ENEOS had a very strong Q4 on the back of improved oil prices, but its power
business suffered a loss of over $300 million due to higher LNG prices in Q4 and the
need to buy power on the spot market due to the cold weather in January. It is
anticipating over $2 billion of lower sales in FY2021 due to Covid-19’s impact on jet
fuel and lubricant consumption. ENEOS is also buying JSR’s elastomer business for $1
billion. Higher copper and oil prices should benefit ENEOS in FY2021.

Idemitsu Kosan also benefited from higher oil valuation gains in Q4 but took an
impairment charge of almost $200 million on a Vietnamese investment. It also lowered
its outlook for FY2021 and beyond due to ESG concerns that will impact its refinery,
thermal coal, and oil and gas businesses.


Electric Power Companies
Chugoku Electric reported full-year net income of $130 million, 2H dividend of Y25
/share, and is forecasting net income of $150 million for FY2021.

Hokkaido Electric reported full-year net income of $330 million, a 2H dividend of
Y15/share, and is forecasting net income of $200 million for FY2021.

Kyushu Electric reported full-year net income $300 million, a 2H dividend of Y17.5
share, and is forecasting net income of $450 million for FY2021.

Tokyo Electric (TEPCO) reported lower fuel costs but also lower electricity sales due
to increased market competition and the pandemic. The state-backed utility’s sales
dropped 13.9%, while operating income fell 68% to $1.3 billion. Income from retail
electricity sales fell 20%.

Kansai Electric reported a 3.7% drop in revenue, but a slight 1% rise in operating
income to $1.32 billion. The utility acknowledged a recent raid on its offices by the
Japan Fair Trade Commission on suspicion of restricting competition in the high
voltage power services, and vowed to fully cooperate with the probe.


LNG importer / Electricity supplier
JERA managed to grow operating income by 49.4% during the pandemic even as its
revenues fell 16.8% due to lower electricity sales and lower gas prices. Japan’s
biggest LNG importer said it lost about $85 million on LNG sales last fiscal year and
slightly more on fuel upstream projects. However, the impact of the deep freeze in

Texas helped bring in $91 million in gas trading profits in North America. An
improvement in the Freeport LNG project in the U.S. also added to profits.


Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Cos.
Chiyoda Corp. recorded a net profit of $100 million for FY2020, and is projecting
lower profits for FY2021 and FY2022. It is forecasting an order book of $3 billion for
FY2021 that does not include any new LNG projects. Chiyoda won the Qatar LNG
expansion project last year.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries reported a pre-tax profit of $500 million.


Metals
Nippon Steel reported a profit of $1 billion for FY2020 on higher steel margins and
lower production costs.

Kobe Steel reported a net profit of $200 million for FY2020, but is cautious about
FY2021 due to lower iron ore prices and flat coking coal prices and losses at its power
generation business. Some power generation facilities will need to be closed for
inspections in FY2021.

Transportation
JR East reported its first ever annual loss since its privatization three decades ago of
$5.5 billion as lockdowns played havoc with passenger numbers. All Japanese rail
companies may look to increase travel tariffs if low passenger loads persist and will
likely lobby for lower power prices for any external electricity they source.

Nissan Motors reported a net loss of $4.5 billion on sales of four million units.
Revenues dropped by $18 billion YoY because of Covid-19.


Gas/Hydrogen
Iwatani posted a record Q4 on the back of a better performance in its energy division.
FY2020 earnings were $300 million. Sales of liquid hydrogen and LP Gas were
stronger. Iwatani is forecasting stronger revenue growth in FY2021 because of the
introduction of METI’s revised energy plan.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Pipeline Outages:
1). A cyber-attack caused the worst critical energy infrastructure outage in U.S. history
last week, closing an 8,800 km pipeline that supplies 45% of the gasoline to the East
Coast, or 15% of total U.S. fuel demand, equivalent to 2.5 million bpd. The operators
of the Colonial Pipeline Company that
connects Texas to New York are now
thought to have paid DarkSide, the
perpetrators of the extortion attack, a
ransom of $5 million. Seventy five
percent of the gas stations in the U.S.
capital were without gasoline for several
days last week, and average prices
across the country hovered around $3
per gallon, the highest since 2014. The
pipeline reopened last Wednesday.

Energy, oil/gas, and utilities have a high
propensity to be hit by ransomware, and
almost 80% of U.S. energy companies
have reported such attacks.

Toshiba’s European subsidiary was also hit by a major cyber-attack last week.



2). An Israeli oil pipeline that runs from the
Red Sea port of Eilat to Ashkelon on the
Mediterranean was hit by rockets during the
country’s conflict with Palestine last week.



3). Governor Whitmer of the U.S. State of Michigan is threatening to seize profits from
Enbridge, the Canadian operator of the Line 5 oil pipeline, that runs along Lake
Michigan, unless the pipeline is closed. Whitmer claims the pipeline poses serious
environmental risks.

Renewable Energy Investments:
The IEA reported that investments in global RE energy in 2020 increased at the fastest
pace since 1999, with over 250 GW of solar and wind installed last year. The IEA has
increased RE forecasts for 2021 and 2022 by 25%.

Oil:
1). OPEC cut expected U.S. oil production for 2021 and is now expecting a YoY fall of
100,000 bpd following an 800,000 cut in 2020.

2). The IEA also cut its oil growth demand forecast for 2021 by 270,000 bpd, to 5.4
mbpd, because of weaker Q1 demand numbers in the U.S., the EU, and India.

Coal:
Three UK banks - HSBC, Barclays, and Standard Chartered - are now thought to have
increased their credit exposure to coal companies by over $30 billion in 2019 in a clear
contravention of the Paris Agreement.

EVs:
1). Nio, the Chinese EV maker is now betting that battery swapping will play the most
important refueling role for EVs in a departure from the Tesla recharging strategy. Nio
is working with Sinopec, the Chinese state-run oil company, to double its network across
China. It also plans to open battery-swapping stations in Norway.
2). Sales of EVs are now $120 billion per year.
3). The CEO of Glencore warns that car industries in the U.S. and EU could be sidelined
unless supplies of cobalt are secured. Cobalt is critical for in lithium-ion batteries.
4). Tesla announced it will no longer accept Bitcoin for purchase of its vehicles due to
its dirty fuel consumption, which is mainly in Inner Mongolia in China. Bitcoin mining
consumes over 120 TWh of power, mostly in China, but some in Iceland.

Copper:
Copper prices rose to over $10,200 per ton last week, doubling since a pandemic low
in March 2020, and hitting their highest levels since 2011 on the back of increased
investment in electrification. Iron ore prices in Singapore also hit a record high last week.

Aviation:
EU governments have now invested $24 billion in European aviation companies. France
now owns 30% of Air France-KLM; Germany owns 20% of Lufthansa; and Italy owns
100% of Alitalia.

Automobiles:
Chip shortages are now estimated to cost the global automobile sector $110 billion of
revenues in 2021.

Rail:
1). Cracks were discovered on several UK trains that were manufactured by Hitachi,
forcing GWR and LNER, two UK train operators, to withdraw over 100 trains. The
compensation bills for Hitachi have still to be determined.
2). With an increased offer of $34 billion Canadian National has overtaken Canadian
Pacific in a bid for Kansas City Southern.

Buildings-Emissions:
Real estate, commercial and residential, generate 40% of global emissions and are now
expected to face increasing scrutiny of sustainability credentials. In 2023 it will be illegal
in the Netherlands to lease buildings that score below a C on the EU sustainability scale.
The EU plans to overhaul 35 million inefficient buildings by 2030 as part of a
“Renovation Wave”.

Shipping:
The Baltic Dry Index rose to its highest level in a decade last week, and a YoY increase
of over 700% as the international commodity boom gains momentum. Capesize vessels,
180,000 dwt, are now charging $41,500 a day.

South Korea:
Hyundai will invest $7.4 billion in the U.S. by 2025 for the production of EVs and for
smart mobility solutions.

China:
1). China now produces 80% of the world’s solar cells using coal-fired power electricity
mainly in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. Calls are being made to introduce carbon border
adjustment taxes for these imports.
2). Tesla has halted plans to expand its Shanghai factory due to uncertainties in US-
China trade relations.

Australia:
Australian coal producers are facing increasing difficulty securing insurance cover for
coal mining operations due to ESG concerns and are asking the government for
support.

India:
Japanese automaker Suzuki has been forced to suspend all earnings guidance for
FY2021 due to the impact of the pandemic in India.

Kurdistan:
The region is significantly revising down its royalties paid to oil producers.

Norway:
As part of efforts to redress the impact of the pandemic that caused the worst
Norwegian economic downturn since WWII, the country is expected to spend a record
$50 billion from its $1.3 trillion sovereign oil fund this year.

Sweden:
Chinese-owned Volvo may seek an IPO listing on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock
exchange later this year, although Geely will remain a major shareholder.

U.K.
1). Calpers, one of the largest pension funds in the U.S., and current chair of the CA100
group of institutional investors controlling $54 trillion in assets, voted against a BP
climate resolution that would have forced that company into closer alignment with the
Paris Agreement. Calpers claims BP is already developing a robust climate strategy.

U.S.
1). Stellantis, the carmaker formed through the alliance of PSA and Fiat Chrysler,
terminated a plan to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of emissions credits from Tesla.
2). Elliott, the activist investor, has taken a stake in Duke Energy that has a market
capitalization of $80 billion. Elliott may force Duke to offload assets. Duke also has
long-term debt of $55 billion. Duke provides electricity to eight million customers and
is facing lawsuits relating to its coal-powered plants.
3). Two oil and gas producers from Colorado, Bonanza Creek Energy and Extraction Oil
& Gas, will combine in an all-stock no-premium merger to form a $2.3 billion company.
4). The $2.8 billion Vineyard Wind project off Nantucket, Massachusetts has been
approved by the U.S. government. The project comprises 84 turbines and is now
expected to be operational by 2023.
