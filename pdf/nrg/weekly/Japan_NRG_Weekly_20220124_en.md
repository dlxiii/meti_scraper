Tsubame BHB to commercialize new ammonia production technology in 2024
(Japan NRG, Jan. 19)
•  Tsubame BHB developed a new ammonia production technology that’s ready for commercial use
in 2024.
•  This electride catalyst-based low temperature, low pressure manufacturing system replaces the
traditional Haber-Bosch process, said Watanabe Masahiro, the company president. The technology

will be ready in 2024 and will be licensed to manufacturers.
•  The Haber-Bosch process has potential output of up to 1.2 million tons/ year, but the new system
allows up to 10 million tons/ year.
•  The ammonia is produced in a 300-400° C and 3-5 MPa environment, compared to 400-500° C
and 20 MPa for the Haber-Bosch process. Manufacturing costs may be cut by 15% for large plants.
•  Tsubame BHB was founded in 2014 by Tokyo Institute of Technology scholars, Mitsubishi
Chemical, Ajinomoto and NYK.

•  CONTEXT: Government ammonia cost target is ¥15-20/ Nm3.
• TAKEAWAY: Like Toyota Motor’s fuel cell vehicles, the electride catalyst uses expensive metals that impact
production costs. Toyota reduced platinum consumption to slash costs. Tsubame needs to make similar efforts
because supply of the metals may not be enough when it comes to rolling out the technology to produce
billions of tons of ammonia.

PM Kishida to integrate energy transition programs into new capitalism strategy

(Japan NRG, Jan 18)
•  Prime Minister Kishida said at a clean energy conference that green transition programs will be
integral to his new capitalism plans. It involves not just energy supply changes but demand side
changes that affect industry structures, lifestyles and municipalities.

JAPAN'S AMMONIA  DEMAND  FORECAST

•  The METI minister will work with the MoE and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport to
come up with energy transition plans. Other ministries and agencies, including the newly created
digital agency and the economic security minister, will also contribute.
•  CONTEXT: The head of METI and staff from all ministries attended the METI meeting on carbon
neutrality and green transformation, which is unusual.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kishida calls for doubling of public and private investments in decarbonization
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 19)
o  In his first policy speech in parliament this year, PM Kishida emphasized "a major
transformation of the entire economy and society" toward net-zero in 2050. He also said
climate change "condenses the negative aspects of capitalism, such as the failure of

markets due to excessive emphasis on efficiency, the lack of sustainability, and the
environmental gap between rich and poor countries.”
o  Kishida called for a doubling of public and private decarbonization investment.
o  Other focuses are power transmission infrastructure, storage batteries, non-carbon power
sources such as renewable energy, hydrogen and ammonia, innovative nuclear power,
and nuclear fusion. He also mentioned financing, and carbon pricing.
• TAKEAWAY: Kishida’s approach to carbon neutrality is energy focused and more centralized compared to the

previous government. Kajiyama, the METI minister under PM Suga, was deeply committed to energy issues,
attending major energy meetings notably when coal power was discussed. Hagiuda, the current METI minister,
is expected to actively engage in speeding up ammonia and hydrogen co-firing, developing supply chains and
setting up a framework to finance them.


Ammonia co-firing costs likely to be higher than renewables: JERA

(Japan NRG, Jan. 19)
•  As ammonia production costs rise, generating power at coal-ammonia co-firing plants will likely
cost more than renewables, JERA told the METI panel on green transformation.
•  Ammonia co-firing costs are forecast at above the ¥19.6/ kWh FIT for biomass, but below the ¥29/
kWh FIT rate for fixed-bottom offshore wind. Ammonia costs, and building production facility
costs, will comprise over half of co-firing costs.
•  CONTEXT: Some experts suggest adding nuclear and ammonia/hydrogen co-firing to the FIT

system currently applied to renewables.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JERA vows to start testing 50% ammonia co-firing by FY2028
(Gas Energy News, Jan. 17)
o  JERA plans to start more than 50% ammonia co-firing at its Hekinan thermal power plant
(Aichi Prefecture) by FY2028. JERA and IHI Corp. will jointly develop and implement an

ammonia co-firing burner. In addition, JERA will work with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to
develop a dedicated ammonia burner suitable for coal boilers.
o  Both projects were adopted as Green Innovation Fund projects by the New Energy and
Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).
o  JERA will test to see which burner is efficient and then remodel the Hekinan power plant,
which is currently testing technology for 20% ammonia co-firing.

METI to introduce auction for fixed-foundation offshore wind power in 2023
(Japan NRG, Jan. 17)
•  Since recent project auctions show the market is more competitive, METI plans to introduce FIT
auctions for the fixed-foundation offshore wind in 2023.

•  The three project auctions last year settled at ¥11.99-17/ kWh, below the ¥29/ kWh ceiling rate set
by the government. METI plans to roll over the 2024 FIT rate of floating offshore wind power at the
2023 level of ¥36/ kWh.
•  There’s only one floating platform operator with a 2 MW project in Goto City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
A second, 16.8 MW project also in Goto, is expected to start operation in 2023.
•  CONTEXT: Fixed-foundation wind platforms in the UK have been running at a rate of ¥5-6/ kWh

thanks to development of large wind turbines of over 150-meter diameters. That is less than half
the level of the winning bids from last year.


METI panel experts divided on offshore wind auction rules

(Japan NRG, Jan. 17)
•  METI’s Power Tariff Committee is divided on the three offshore wind auctions that resulted in the
Mitsubishi-Chubu Electric consortium winning.
•  During the Jan. 17 panel meeting on renewable tariff rules, Nihon University professor, Ando
Munetomo, said the results were regretful as single group dominance will hamper healthy industry
growth, limiting the number of experienced companies.
•  Matsumoto Toshihiro of Tokyo University disagreed, saying that Japanese companies can enter the
market by partnering with experienced overseas project operators; opportunities are open to build

up track records. The Mitsubishi consortium sweeping the three auctions does not mean it will
dominate the power market; offshore wind is only a small part of it. Changing auction rules, so that
multiple parties win at the expense of higher bids, will skew the selection process.
•  CONTEXT: The Power Tariff Committee sets renewable power auction rules, which indirectly
impact the power station auctions, which are determined by a separate working group of METI and
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.
• TAKEAWAY: As covered in last week’s Analysis section, the auction results are going to remain a contentious

subject for quite some time since so many of the competitors missed out. The question is, will the sour grapes
hurt the current projects and impact new developments? One angle that critics of the auction results may take
is to say that the winning bids were clearly below cost and that is a form of price dumping, which infringes on
the second article of the Antimonopoly Act. However, what the Act mostly does is it bans the dominant
operator from abusing its position to limit competition. In which case: are the construction of power facilities
and power generation separate markets? And should offshore wind power supplies be in the same category as

thermal power?


Committee overseeing renewable capacity auctions sets out terms for this year

(New Energy Business News, Jan. 19)
•  METI’s Procurement Price Calculation Committee presented a draft of the bidding system for
FY2022, which starts in April 2022.
o  Commercial solar: the price ceiling to be announced in advance and bids to be for 250
kW and up; auctions will be held four times this year.

o  Onshore wind: 1.3 million kW will be solicited for projects of 50 kW or more; additional
bids will be accepted if capacity exceeds 1.7 million kW; the price cap will be the higher
of the weighted average bid price of the initial bid or ¥15/ kWh.
o  Biomass: will cover general woody and other materials of 10,000 kW or more, and liquid
fuels of all sizes; the upper limit price will remain undisclosed.

o  The bidding schedule is: April 18 for solar, and Sept. 5 for onshore wind and biomass.


Construction firm wins approval for carbon credits based on energy saved at its homes

(New Energy Business News, Jan. 19)
•  Daito Trust Construction received approval to convert CO2 emission reductions from energy-
saving homes it sold to be certified as credits under the domestic J-credit system.
•  This is the first permission to register credits based on the category: "New construction of energy
efficient housing or retrofitting work to make housing more energy efficient”.
• TAKEAWAY: This is very significant — a firm saves energy and then is allowed to use those savings to offset
other business lines. Some may argue this isn’t entirely fair, but it does produce a net-positive for the
environment.



Ministry opens competition to find entities to commercialize tidal power

(New Energy Business News, Jan. 20)
•  In FY2022, the MoE will select an entity to implement the "Project for Establishing a Model for
Decarbonizing Local Communities through Tidal Power Generation”. The proposal submission
deadline is Feb. 4, and a decision will be made in early March.
•  The project’s budget will be ¥650 million in FY2022, and aims to commercialize tidal current power
generation systems that have high potential in areas such as remote islands.




METI extends review period of palm oil’s sustainability for one more year
(Japan NRG, Jan. 17)
•  METI extended the review period on sustainability of palm oil as a biomass fuel by one year, to

March 2023. Started in 2018, the review won’t be extended.
•  In addition to establishing sustainability, the biomass fuel must clear the carbon emission threshold
of 180 grams/ MJ, and operators need to reduce fuel consumption by 50% by 2030.




METI launches experts panel on sustainable storage battery system
(Japan NRG, Jan. 21)
•  METI started a new panel on sustainable storage battery systems, composed of scholars and
industrial bodies. Demand for storage batteries is skyrocketing globally but there are
technological, sustainability and human rights challenges to address.
•  Storage capacities, energy efficiency and safety mechanisms need to improve, and costs and

carbon need to go down, a METI official told the inaugural meeting.

•  The panel will publish an interim report in mid-year and launch new initiatives, such as carbon
footprint reporting and disclosure rules. Last year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association started collecting spent lithium-ion batteries for reuse.




Chips and batteries: Japan to amp up supply chains with subsidies
(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 17)
•  The Japanese govt. will set up a program to assist companies developing chips, large-capacity
batteries and other key materials to ensure a steady supply of strategic products.
•  This comes after U.S.-China trade tensions and the pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in Japan's
supply chains.
•  The government will identify a list of items that merit subsidies. Rare-earth metals and

pharmaceuticals will be included. The program will be up and running by FY2025.
•  Companies will first submit plans for research or production facilities to be screened. Approval will
require a guarantee to continue production for a certain period, steps to protect proprietary
technology, and promises of stable supply to the domestic market.




Developers demand construction companies disclose emissions
(Nikkei Xtech, Jan. 13)
•  As corporations step up efforts to reduce their carbon footprint, including emissions by suppliers,
property developers are putting pressure on construction companies to disclose emissions figures.
•  Construction company Taisei Corp. developed an AI-based system that creates emissions profiles
for building sites based on security footage.
•  By counting the number of concrete pump trucks, crawler cranes, pile drivers, and garbage

collection trucks entering a building site, the system automatically estimates total emissions.



Steelmaker JFE to issue first transition bonds among Japan’s manufacturers
(NHK, Jan. 20)
•  Major steelmaker JFE Holdings will issue ‘transition bonds’ to finance technologies to improve
steelmaking energy efficiency and make steel parts for EV motors.
•  The bond issue will take place in the coming financial year.
•  JFE aims to raise around ¥30 billion ($260 million).



Toray hydrogen separation module halves energy use

(Nikkei X-Tech, Jan. 20)
•  Toray unveiled a system for separating hydrogen from CO2 and other gases.
•  Advances in membrane permeability mean that Toray’s module does not require prefiltration of
inlet gases. This reduces energy consumption by over 50%.
•  The module is compact, with a footprint one quarter the size of existing systems.
•  The hydrogen yielded is 98% pure.

Tokyo City and power retailer Looop to set up $100 mln sustainable energy fund
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 20)
•  Power retailer Looop will establish a "Sustainable Energy Fund" with Tokyo to promote renewable
energy power plants and clean energy supply bases, such as hydrogen stations. The fund's target

size is more than ¥10 billion and its duration until 2037.
•  As a limited partner, the Tokyo Govt will invest ¥1 billion in the fund, and invite a range of private
companies for the remainder of the fund’s capital.
•  In November 2021, the Tokyo Govt invited applications to establish a sustainable energy fund to
develop green finance and build a decarbonized society. Two companies applied.



Tokyo Gas partners with Yokohama City to test methanation development
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 21)
•  Tokyo Gas signed an agreement with Yokohama City to demonstrate methanation, a process that
produces methane (CH4) through the reaction of CO2 and hydrogen. The idea is to test
production and utilization of hydrogen and carbon-neutral methane.
•  In March, a demo begins at the Tokyo Gas Yokohama Techno Station in Tsurumi Ward.
•  It'll test the capacities and challenges of water electrolysis and methanation equipment using solar-

powered energy.



Kansai Electric to test smart pole tech that wirelessly charges smartphones
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 18)
•  Kansai Electric started a demonstration experiment of smart poles in Yumeshima, the site of the
Kansai World Expo 2025 in Osaka. The poles are a generic name for multi-functional poles
equipped with communication base stations, Wi-Fi, cameras, etc.
•  The test will verify energy supply to the poles from solar generators, the wireless recharging of
smartphones, and the performance of Wi-Fi functions, as well as the durability of poles against salt

and wind damage.
•  From March, the company plans to evaluate the performance of charging drone batteries using
non-contact power supply.



Sojitz selected for Australia green hydrogen project
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 17)
•  Sojitz was selected to participate in the MoE’s third-country hydrogen collaboration project. The
trading house will start a demonstration project to produce green hydrogen in Australia and ship it

Marubeni to start green hydrogen project in South Australia
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 17)
•  Marubeni Corporation will start a demo project to make green hydrogen from renewable energy
sources in South Australia, transport it to Indonesia using hydrogen storage alloys, and utilize the

hydrogen in fuel cells at an industrial park near Jakarta.
•  The MoE selected it as one of the projects to receive subsidies. Marubeni is keen to tap into
surplus renewables electricity generated in South Australia, optimizing the use of water
electrolysers and batteries via an energy management system.
•  The plan is to have the hydrogen production facilities in place by January 2023, and to start
transporting it to Indonesia later that year.




Japanese manufacturers lead race to mass produce PV cells
(Nikkei X-Tech, Jan. 19)
•  The first company ever to mass produce PV solar cells was a Japanese start-up backed by major
travel agent HIS.
•  While manufacturers such as Toshiba and Panasonic lead global production of large PV panels,

they face competition from China, Europe and the U.S.
•  To ensure Japan remains competitive, government-backed NEDO aims to bring the cost of PV
down to ¥15/ watt, below the generation cost for mass-produced silicon panels.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has not been a leader in the solar PV market for many years now, but it’s interesting that
the Nikkei’s tech-focused media outlet paints a more positive narrative. In general, the public is more receptive
of technologies in which the home companies are considered to be global leaders.




PV panel waste to skyrocket
(NHK, Jan. 14)
•  CONTEXT: Concern about solar panel waste is a relatively new topic in mainstream Japanese
media, but it has now reached even the national broadcaster, NHK.
•  Solar panels, which took off in Japan from 2012, have a service life of 20 to 30 years. Experts

forecast a steep increase in the number of panels discarded over coming years.
•  With space at a premium, many operators are retiring older, less efficient panels early to replace
them with more efficient models.
•  Built to be robust, PV panels are costly and labor-intensive to recycle. Some generators abandon
unwanted panels or even dump them illegally. Over 4000 metric tons of panels are discarded in
Japan every year and tough rules must be introduced regulating their disposal.
•  Marubeni will reprocess the glass component of panels into a soil additive for strawberry farmers.

Tokyo Gas considering buying into renewable energy operator: CEO
(Diamond, Jan. 16)
•  Tokyo Gas president Uchida Takashi commented on oil refining major ENEOS Holdings’ purchase
of JRE Corp. While that company was out of Tokyo Gas’ reach due to its high price, “we are also
considering approaches that would allow us to take a stake in a company that deals in renewable
energy sources.”
•  He noted that sourcing new locations for large-scale solar and other renewables plants is tough,

and existing green energy facilities are competing with each other.
•  A less competitive field for entry may be floating offshore wind power generation, Uchida said.
Tokyo Gas took a stake in a U.S. start-up that is working to develop the technology to construct
floating offshore wind power facilities at a low cost.
•  CONTEXT: Last year, Tokyo Gas established TG Octopus Energy, a joint venture with Octopus
Energy in the UK, as a power retail and services provider. It will employ personalized marketing to

each client based on digital tools.



Power producers forced to absorb higher fuel costs, damaging profits
(Nikkei, Jan. 20)
•  While legislation allows Japan’s major power producers to pass on increases in fuel costs to

domestic subscribers, fuel procurement costs for March reported by Kansai, Chugoku and
Hokuriku Electric are around ¥43,600 per kiloliter (fuel oil equivalent), which exceeds the maximum
cost of ¥40,700 that can be passed on under the scheme.
•  In many cases, power companies will have to absorb all increases above ¥40,700, which can’t be
passed onto domestic subscribers on supply contracts entered into before the electricity market
was deregulated in 2016.
• TAKEAWAY: What’s even more amazing about this development is how much the power bills have grown in

recent months. Data published by the Bank of Japan last week revealed that the household electricity bill
jumped 13.4% in December, its biggest monthly gain since March 1981. That’s a 40-year record broken, and
yet the power utilities are still out of pocket.


Power aggregation system to launch in April 2022

(Japan NRG, Jan. 19)
•  To increase power availability during shortages and to store power when it’s redundant, METI will
accept notifications by businesses launching demand response and power aggregator services. A
draft ordinance will be made in February for consultation with industry, to be formalized in March.
•  In the 2025 capacity auction, held October last year, 4.75 GW was provided for the aggregation
scheme, up from 4.15 GW for 2024. Separately, METI will offer ¥13 billion in subsidies to
businesses installing storage battery systems and electrolysis equipment for hydrogen production.

Floating offshore wind: Japanese and Western developers vie for lucrative contracts
(Nikkei, Jan. 18)
•  While Japan leads the world in floating wind turbine technology, competitors have caught up, and
Japanese corporations might lose their competitive edge.

•  Platforms for floating wind turbines may be categorized into spar platforms suited to deep waters
(employed by TEPCO RP), tension leg platforms (MODEC), expensive but relatively stable semi-
submersible platforms (Hitachi Zosen, Tokyo Gas, Japan Marine United, Equinor), and barge
platforms (BW Ideol).
•  In early January, Norwegian energy giant Equinor revealed plans to build a large floating wind
farm off Hokkaido’s coast. However, Equinor must submit a successful tender first.
•  While some Japanese competitors are skeptical about Equinor’s chances, its entry into Japan’s

market is a major challenge to local industry.
•  Hokkaido’s mild winds and deep waters are suitable for floating platforms.
•  Japan Wind Power Association said the country can accommodate 128 GW of fixed-bottom
capacity, and 420 GW of floating capacity.
•  Japan has stringent typhoon-proofing requirements on offshore wind turbines that can make
tension leg platforms that require heavy anchoring cables less economic.
•  The tendency of floating platforms to be installed in deep waters means they’re less vulnerable

than fixed-bottom counterparts to tsunami damage. This superior resilience could see floating
platforms gain an edge over fixed-bottom platforms, not only in Japan, but also in Southeast Asia.
•  Despite the technology’s promise, the government has yet to establish long-term targets for
floating platforms or offer support to shipbuilders looking to mass produce the platforms.
•  The U.S., UK, Spain, and South Korea all plan ambitious floating wind projects, and Japan may
soon be overtaken as No. 1.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
SSE, MARUBENI and CIP win right to develop giant floating offshore wind farm in UK
(Company Statement, Jan. 17)
o  Renewable energy developer, SSE Renewables, along with Marubeni Corporation and
Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), won rights in ScotWind to develop one of the
world’s largest floating offshore wind farms, off the east coast of Scotland, UK.

o  The group won rights to 858 km2 of seabed in the E1 Zone off the Angus Coast, one of
the largest lease areas offered in ScotWind by Crown Estate Scotland.
o  The lease area has average water depths of 72 meters, making the site suitable for
floating offshore wind turbines to deliver up to 2.6 GW of new installed capacity. When
complete, Scotland will be a global leader in floating offshore wind technology.




Renova to focus on other strengths after failed wind bid
(Nikkei, Jan. 20)
•  Renova’s failure to win a contract to build wind farms off Akita wiped out 70% of its share price, as
the market reacted to the ¥25 billion of lost potential revenue.
•  But some analysts aren’t pessimistic. Renova stands to earn significant revenue once solar and
biomass projects currently under construction go online.

Pumped hydro running at capacity as grid struggles to smooth renewable volatility
(Nikkei, Jan 15)
•  Kyushu Electric, which operates in an area known for solar farms, has seen its use of pumped hydro

Japan Seeks to Fix Excess Renewables Output Dilemma;

Curtailment of Green Electricity May Spread Nationwide

A model for how Japan may evolve as it relies more on renewables can be found in
the southwestern region of Kyushu. The area has seen renewables capacity expand at
over 30% a year. Yet the quick growth has also created a major challenge: excess
electricity at certain times of the day is currently wasted.

Due to the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy, local grids are keen to retain
traditional energy sources. At times of surplus, some power plants are asked to cut
output. To date, solar has been the most frequently curtailed renewable source.

What’s more, Kyushu’s conundrum will soon spread to four more regions of Japan,
according to government forecasts. Whether local grids curtail output from solar farms
or other power sources, someone will be hit with financial losses. Both operators of
renewables assets and older utilities that run thermal and nuclear plants are warning
that curtailing their output would discourage future investments.

The ability to resolve the situation in Kyushu will prove vital in creating a roadmap that
the rest of the country can deploy.


Curtailments started on islands
The intermittent nature of solar and wind energy means that the traditional way to
deal with excess variable renewable energy (VRE) has been curtailment - a reduction
in the output of a generator.

Curtailment of solar electricity started in the sunny southwestern Kyushu region after
2012 when a generous feed-in tariff (FIT) program brought a rush of solar developers.

It began on small islands with low power demand. The first curtailment occurred on
May 5, 2015, on Tanegashima, with a population of just 27,000. It happened on two
more islands in the years that followed. On Oct. 13, 2018, the first curtailment on
Kyushu’s main island took place.

Since then, curtailment is a regular feature in Kyushu, especially in spring and fall
when demand for air conditioners is low, or during holidays when factories are not
operating.

According to METI’s rules, adjustments of output are made in the following order:

•  Fossil fuel-powered plants (coal, oil and gas) and pumped-storage hydro plants
•  Interregional connections
•  Biomass power plants
•  Solar, wind power plants
•  Nuclear, hydro, and geothermal power plants

This rule for priority dispatching, according to METI, is set in accordance with the
generation cost of each power source and technological differences. Nuclear, hydro
and geothermal are categorized as “long-term fixed power sources.” METI says it is
difficult to control their output quickly and frequently.

Curtailment can also happen due to local transmission constraints when there’s not
enough transmission capacity to deliver renewable power to where there’s demand.

So far, curtailment has occurred only in Kyushu. But as other regions add solar and
wind capacity, METI forecasts that the same issue will spread to Hokkaido, Tohoku,
Shikoku and Okinawa regions.

Up to 730 million kWh of solar in Kyushu (equivalent of 5.2% of the region’s total
renewables output) may be curtailed next fiscal year, which starts in April, METI says.

Areas        Curtailment Volume          Equivalent to total renewable output
Shikoku      Up to 53.9 million kWh of solar 1.1%
Tohoku       Up to 31.4 million kWh of solar 0.33%
Hokkaido     Up to 1.4 million kWh of solar and wind 0.35%

Okinawa      Up to 976,000 kWh of solar  0.2%
Source: METI
A loss-loss situation
Curtailment means financial losses for generating companies and lost opportunities to
use energy from sources that don’t emit CO2. In order to remedy the situation, METI
suggested during a meeting in December that curtailment focus should be turned
from renewables to plants that run on fossil fuels Currently, operators of coal- and
gas-fired plants can be ordered to limit output to 50% of capacity, but METI proposed
dropping that to between 20% and 30%.

Major power utilities claim that this will cause technical stress on existing thermal
power plants around the country, which would endanger energy security. What’s
more, such low caps would make new investments in thermal power plants highly
unlikely, says Ikebe Kazuhiro, chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies
of Japan and CEO of Kyushu Electric.

The Kyushu region, where renewable capacity has increased about 31% on an annual
basis since 2011, has 10.6 GW of solar and 630 MW of wind generation installed.

Beside curtailing renewables, Kyushu Electric is expanding its grid capacity to transmit
excess solar power to Japan’s mainland. The utility has also installed a 50 MW (300
MWh) storage battery in Fukuoka Prefecture to absorb excess solar power.

The utility is also working to shift the electricity demand of industry and residents. It’s
working with Tokyo Steel, which typically uses cheaper electricity at night and on
weekends. Kyushu Electric notifies the steelmaker in advance when cheaper electricity
becomes available during the day so that Tokyo Steel can shift production to factories
in Kyushu from those elsewhere.

For residential use, the utility has partnered with SB Power, SoftBank’s electricity unit,
to shift power demand for EVs and home appliances like washers and irons to daytime
with some 18,000 households participating. Residents can earn points on gift cards for
charging their cars and doing the laundry when there’s plenty of sunlight.


The bigger solutions
Larger-scale solutions are needed. METI proposed to revise the Energy Conservation
Act to optimize power demand, which would introduce dynamic pricing. This is meant
to shift demand to times when renewable energy is plentiful, partly dovetailing supply
with lifestyle.

Hydrogen is also expected to play a key role absorbing excess renewable power. The
Hibikinada waterfront area in Kitakyushu City is home to a total 160 MW of renewable
capacity (solar, wind and biomass). A consortium of Fukuoka Prefecture, Kitakyushu
City, IHI, ENEOS, Fukuoka Oxygen, and Kitakyushu Power has been working since
2020 to produce hydrogen from the local renewable sources and supply hydrogen
through a pipeline at hydrogen stations. The three-year, 800-million-yen pilot project
funded by the MoE aims to build a low-cost, carbon-free hydrogen supply chain.

In August, the government awarded funding from the Green Innovation Fund for
three projects to develop technologies to produce hydrogen made with renewables.
Among the recipients: Asahi Kasei, JGC, TEPCO, Hitachi Zosen, and Siemens Energy.

Of course, integrating intermittent electricity is an issue in many parts of the world and
so far there seems to be no single winning formula. It is often addressed through a
combination of technologies and policies.

Japan’s current share of VRE at 8.2% is a paltry amount compared with Denmark’s
58.5% and south Australia’s 46.6%, according to IEA data. In the case of Denmark,
which transitioned to a higher VRE share over 20 years, flexible thermal power plants
and interconnectors played a big role in the early stage of transition, according to a
Danish Energy Agency report released last year.

For Japan, importing power from other countries is just not an option, while major
owners of thermal power, like Kyushu Electric, tend to have little renewables capacity
themselves and few incentives to sacrifice their output.

One of the government’s biggest CO2 reduction strategies, often mentioned in long-
term energy strategy documents, talks of promoting lifestyle changes. Kyushu may
show just how much flexibility there is in the demand side of Japan.

Think Pink: Japan’s Domestic Hydrogen Ambitions
May Rely on Next-Generation Nuclear Technology

A decade before the world became familiar with the color-based terminology of
hydrogen, especially the green and blue versions, Japan’s strategy for producing the
clean-burning gas rested on nuclear power. After the Fukushima accident, the
domestic nuclear-powered hydrogen program was frozen, but it’s now making a
comeback.

Last summer, the High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) in central Japan
was restarted after a 10-year hiatus. The experimental reactor is cooled by helium, as
opposed to water like most reactors in operation today. Its design both reduces risk
and allows the technology to produce heat of around 950°C, enough for
thermochemical manufacture of clean hydrogen.

Unlike Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology, in which Japan is only starting to get
involved, the HTTR facility represents the world’s most advanced operating example
of the so-called high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR). As more and more
countries consider HTGR technology, both for its increased safety and potential to
make hydrogen, Japan’s experience is bringing in new international partnerships and
commercial contracts.

Poland’s entire nuclear energy program, created to move the nation away from coal,
is predicated on Japan’s HTGR designs and experience.

Domestically, the fate of the HTTR facility is even more crucial. It’s baked into the
Basic Energy Plan and Japan’s concept for a hydrogen society, while the Green
Growth Strategy describes it as a key technology for the development of large-scale
hydrogen production by 2030. The tech is also an important vector for some of the
big engineering firms, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toshiba.

While the government has yet to voice support for new nuclear facilities, due to fears
over voter pushback, the rebirth of nuclear as a hydrogen enabler may offer a path
back to acceptance.

What is a High Temperature Gas Reactor (HTGR)?

HTGR is a nuclear reactor that uses helium gas for its coolant and graphite (ceramic material) for its core structure to
enable high-efficiency power generation at 1000°C, three times higher than that of conventional light-water reactors.

Helium gas is an inert gas that does not bond with other molecules. Therefore, it does not cause chemical reactions no
matter how high the temperature, avoiding the risk of hydrogen or steam explosions.
HTGR is said to be safer than most of the reactors operating today since graphite, which has an enormous heat capacity,
allows for slow temperature variation and enables the core to be cooled passively even in the loss of coolant, preventing
core meltdown. Graphite cladding is heat resistant up to 2,500°C, which is twice as high as the temperature at the time of
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear accident.

The history
Japan’s HTGR development began in 1969, led
by the predecessor of the Japan Atomic Energy
Agency (JAEA). It researched nuclear heat
utilization technology and irradiation of materials
under high temperatures.

In 1991, the JAEA ordered the construction of
the nation’s first HTTR, a research reactor with a
thermal output of 30 MW, at the Oarai Research
Institute in Ibaraki Prefecture. It sits 30 meters
underground to protect it from tsunami and

terrorist attacks, although the control room is at ground level.
The plant began operation in November 1998 and passed safety demonstration tests
in 2002. It generated a temperature of 950°C for 50 consecutive days and
continuously produced hydrogen for 150 hours from the heat, which is still considered
to be the best performance from a HTGR unit.

In February 2011, the plant was shut down for planned inspection, but after the
Fukushima disaster all operations were frozen while the facility was upgraded to
comply with revised safety standards. It finally passed regulatory approval in June
2020 and restarted in July 2021. The plant was temporarily halted in October to
complete its final inspection, a test of its safety at 100% output.

Following the restart of the HTTR plant, current METI minister Hagiuda, who was
previously head of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
(MEXT), said that he expects consistent progress in HTGR technologies to expand
hydrogen production in the coming years. The technology is important to accelerate
carbon neutrality among the various industries.

Today
As for the next step, the JAEA plans to restart the plant this month and rejoin
international cooperation on HTGR research. This includes the Loss of Forced Coolant
(LOFC) project, which is a safety verification test that’s been carried out in Japan since
2009 under the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) framework. NEA is part of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

The first stage of the LOFC test was completed in 2010, when the HTTR showed it
could cool naturally, without outside support or coolant, after power was shut down
while the unit ran at 30% output. Now, Japan aims to complete a demonstration test
of a shutdown from 100% output to test the reactor under more severe conditions.

Japan is also working to develop an advanced HTGR fuel for extended burn-up. The
country was the first to create a commercial fuel fabrication facility for HTGR fuel,
which is known as TRISO (Tri-structural isotropic)-coated fuel particle.


H is for hydrogen
While Japan’s HTTR design can work simply for power generation, since inception it’s
been seen as a way to source cheap heat for hydrogen production using the Iodine-
Sulfur process, through water dissociation. The process relies on strong acids.

| Following the restart of the HTTR plant, current METI minister Hagiuda, who was |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| previously head of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| (MEXT), said that he expects consistent progress in HTGR technologies to expand |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| hydrogen production in the coming years. The technology is important to accelerate |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| carbon neutrality among the various industries. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Today |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| As for the next step, the JAEA plans to restart the plant this month and rejoin |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| international cooperation on HTGR research. This includes the Loss of Forced Coolant |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| (LOFC) project, which is a safety verification test that’s been carried out in Japan since |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2009 under the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) framework. NEA is part of the |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | OECD). |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The first stage of the LOFC test was completed in 2010, when the HTTR showed it |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| could cool naturally, without outside support or coolant, after power was shut down |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| while the unit ran at 30% output. Now, Japan aims to complete a demonstration tes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | t |  |
| of a shutdown from 100% output to test the reactor under more severe conditions |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | . |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Japan is also working to develop an |  |  |  |  | advanced HTGR fuel for extended burn-up. The |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| country was the first to |  |  |  | create a commercial |  | fuel fabrication facility for HTGR fuel, |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| which is known as TRISO (Tri-structural isotropic)-coated fuel particle. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| H is for hydrogen |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| While Japan’s HTTR design can work simply for power generation, since inception it’s |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| been seen as a way to source cheap heat for hydrogen production using the Iodine- |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Sulfur process, through water dissociation. The process relies on strong acids. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The initial designs for HTTR were devised by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which also
headed the construction. The company said recently that it is now working to develop
hydrogen production technology and a helium gas turbine direct power generation
system that will improve efficiency of the HTTR. MHI says these technologies will be
the key for HTTR commercialization.

JAEA researchers told media this month that a hydrogen plant linked to the HTTR unit
is slated to start production of the gas in 2026-27. With a heat output of 600 MW, an
HTTR facility can produce enough fuel over 300,000 fuel cell vehicles for a year.

Other Japanese firms closely involved in HTTRs are Toshiba and Fuji Electric.

Hydrogen produced with the help of nuclear power is termed ‘pink’ to differentiate
from the gas made from renewable energy sources (‘green’) or fossil fuels (‘grey’ and
‘blue’ if the emissions are captured and stored).


China stealing ahead?
While Japan’s nuclear R&D was shelved for a decade, China has sped up its
development of HTGRs, creating a 10 MWt high-temperature helium-cooled test
reactor (HTR-10) in the 2000s. The unit is a pebble bed-type reactor, which is based
on German technology. Japan uses a block-type HTGR design.

The HTR-10 began operations two years after Japan’s HTTR. However, over the last
10 years, China has moved onto the next stage: operation of 200 MW high-
temperature gas-cooled pebble-bed modular reactor (HTR-PM).

Commercialization of HTGRs is progressing in six municipalities in China, with three in
Fujian and one each in Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces. China plans to
build a commercial-size 1.2 GW HTGR by employing 12 100-MW HTR-PM reactors.

Although China is one step ahead towards commercialization of HTGR technology, it
falls short in performance. The HTR-PM is only able to produce temperatures up to
750°C, which is 200°C lower than Japan’s HTTR. This lower temperature makes it
difficult to achieve hydrogen production.


Future of Japan’s HTTR and international cooperation
When its domestic program was halted, Japan’s HTGR researchers turned to working
with partners overseas. International cooperation remains important to further the
rollout of HTGR technology globally, especially in countries new to nuclear energy,
and the tech’s eventual commercialization.

In 2017, JAEA signed a memorandum with Poland’s National Center for Nuclear
Research (NCBJ) for a commercialization of HTGR in Poland. While it could not act as
a commercial entity to build the reactors in the European country, JAEA has acted as
a scientific advisor and helped Poland set up its nuclear program from scratch.

From this January, JAEA will expand its joint research on the basis of HTTR to six
countries, including France, Germany, and South Korea. The research will also be
used to further development of hydrogen production.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Brazil/ Nuclear power
The Ministry of Mines and Energy will seek and identify sites for nuclear power plants
that are planned to be operational by 2050. Brazil relies on hydropower for as much
as 65% of its electricity. The country only has one nuclear power plant, Angra, which
produces about 3% of the nation’s total energy.

China/ Electricity
Electricity generation might triple by 2060 to supply 60% of the country’s total energy
as a way to reach net-zero, said Royal Dutch Shell, adding that Beijing must be more
decisive on the clean energy front. China plans to reach peak emissions by 2030, but
lacks a detailed zero carbon emissions roadmap for 2060.

China/ Offshore wind power
Three Gorges Corp will spend about $6.5 bln to build three offshore wind farms in the
Guangdong province. Best known for hydroelectric dams, in the next three years the
state-owned company plans to triple power output from wind turbines and solar
panels to 80 GW. This would make it the world’s largest offshore wind operator.

India/ Renewables
Energy, telecom and retail conglomerate Reliance Industries, owned by billionaire
Mukesh Ambani, will invest $80 bln in 100 GW of green energy capacity, aiming for
net-zero emissions by 2035. This follows recent plans by Adani Group, owned by
billionaire Gautam Adani, to invest $70 bln to become India’s and the world’s biggest
renewable energy producer by 2030.

Italy/ Energy crisis
The government will spend as much as €4 billion to help consumers who are suffering
from high energy prices. In the first quarter, Italians are facing electricity and gas bill
hikes of 55% and 42%, respectively.

Serbia/ Lithium
Belgrade terminated plans by Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto to develop a
$2.4 bln lithium mine that has the potential to be one of the world's largest. The
strategic metal is vital for many green technologies and modern devices. The news
comes shortly after Australia deported Novak Djokovic, the world's top tennis player,
and a Serbian.

UK/ Offshore wind power
The £2 billion, 860-MW Triton Knoll offshore wind farm in the North Sea will be fully
operational in March. With 90 Vestas turbines, each 164 meters high, it’s one of the
world’s largest offshore wind farms. The project is 59% owned by Germany’s RWE;
Japan’s Kansai Electric Power and J-Power have stakes of 16% and 25%, respectively.

UK/ Offshore wind power
With more than 70 bids from global energy companies and investment firms, the
ScotWind leasing auction of seabed plots for offshore wind projects earned £700
million. The 17 projects have a total potential generating capacity of 25 GW, and
cover 7,000 km2.

U.S./ Solar power
Clean energy company Intersect Power obtained federal approval for its 500-MW
Oberon Solar Project on federal land in California. The project, which covers 2,700
acres, includes a battery storage system that can store 500 MW for up to four hours.

U.S./ Oil and net-zero
ExxonMobil set a net zero goal for GHG emissions at its oil and gas operations by
2050. The company previously resisted having a 2050 net-zero target, saying it didn’t
have a realistic plan on how to achieve it.
