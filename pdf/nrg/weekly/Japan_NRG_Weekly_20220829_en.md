NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Kishida asks GX Council to push nuclear restarts, prolong nuclear plant life
(Japan NRG, Aug. 24)
•  PM Kishida told the GX Council to design new regulatory mechanisms by year’s end to increase
nuclear power by restarting more reactors, prolonging the life of existing nuclear plants, and
building new next-gen reactors.
•  This change of policy was already in the roadmap for innovative nuclear reactors. The PM called for

clarifying the specific challenges to achieve this goal by the end of 2022.
•  Nuclear, like renewables, are essential to realize carbon neutrality, Kishida said, adding that the
LNG supply security framework and storage battery strategy will also be established. The Council
will propose policies to realize these goals by year’s end.
•  CONTEXT: It may seem odd that GX Council’s policy research into nuclear, LNG supply security
and storage battery expansion overlaps with the work of METI. However, this is nothing new. The
Abe and Suga governments created cross-ministry councils that overwrote ministry policies. The

dual-structure did, however, lead to political turf wars in the past. Kishida will need to exercise
strong leadership.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
PM calls for discussion on new nuclear plants, restart of seven existing reactors
(Mainichi Shimbun, Aug. 24)

o  The government will look at building next-gen nuclear power stations. Previously, it
didn’t envisage replacing existing NPPs, so a decision to build new plants would
represent a major change.
o  The government will also discuss possibly extending the legally-allowable service life of
NPPs beyond the current 60 year maximum.
o  Finally, the government wants to restart the seven reactors that have a green light from
the NRA but that have not yet been brought back online.

o  CONTEXT: The seven reactors in the above category are Units 6 and 7 of Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa NPP, Unit 2 of Onagawa NPP, Units 1 and 2 of Takanawa NPP, Unit 2 of Shimane
NPP, and Tokai 2 NPP.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Komeito supports restarting nuclear plants
(Nikkei, Aug. 25)

o  Yamaguchi Natsuo, leader of Komeito, the LPD’s coalition partner, said it will support the
restart of those nuclear reactors that have passed stringent safety inspections in
communities where locals support the restart.
• TAKEAWAY: Kishida’s comments about the need to build new, next-generation nuclear reactors in Japan
provoked a flurry of headlines not only in domestic media but across the world. The comments, however, were
simply following METI’s announcement of the nuclear roadmap, as reported by Japan NRG Weekly two weeks
ago and reviewed in detail in the Analysis section last week.

• Of course, a prime minister’s announcement makes the strategy on nuclear seem more definite and the
broader media attention is warranted. Still, putting the roadmap into practice will be very difficult and many
more steps have to be taken before it can be accepted as a given. Even with recent polls showing that more
than 50% of the public support nuclear energy – the first such uptick in over a decade – the path to restarting
existing nuclear facilities and building new ones remains littered with challenges.

• On the other hand, Kishida's announcement of restarting another seven reactors by next summer is much
bolder. While those units already have a permit to operate, they carry an array of complications. For example,
Unit 2 of Onagawa NPP is scheduled to restart only in February 2024, while Units 6 and 7 of Kashiwazaki-

Kariwa NPP need to get further NRA approvals due to recently unveiled security. Shimane NPP, like many of
the other nuclear facilities, is struggling to gain local government approval for a restart, among other issues.
• The key point to watch is how much political capital Kishida and his team are willing to extend to persuading
towns and prefectures housing NPPs to accept the restarts. Surely, the biggest battle will be over TEPCO’s

Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP.



Government seeks public comments on expanding offshore wind promotion zones

(Government statement, Aug. 25)
•  The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport
and Tourism seek public feedback on a government proposal to expand offshore wind promotion
zones by adding three more areas: Murakami-Tainai coast in Niigata Prefecture, Oga-Katagami-
Akita coast in Akita Prefecture and Eshima coast in Nagasaki Prefecture. The comment submissions
will close on September 8.




METI seeks to narrow definition of what would be an “LNG supply emergency”
(Japan NRG, Aug. 22)
•  METI’s working group on basic power and gas regulatory systems agreed that defining an
“emergency” was important in the process of building an effective LNG security framework.
•  CONTEXT: “Emergency” generally refers to potential supply cuts due to geopolitical tensions,
market changes and other causes. The question was, at what point of time should the gas utilities

and the government determine they need to involve consumers to curb consumption.
•  The gas sector is following power utility practices of sharing power and fuel supplies, but some
noted that copying power demand response schemes may not be realistic. If LNG tanks are full
due to conservation, fresh gas supplies delivered into Japan won’t find storage space.
•  Some working group members suggested amending the Gas Business Act in the coming
parliament session, giving the METI minister the authority to order consumption cuts. However,
uncertainties over Sakhalin LNG supplies have made some consumers nervous, and some METI

officials appear to be cautious about this hard-liner approach.

Renewable supply-demand balancing costs forecast at ¥353 billion/ year
(Japan NRG, Aug. 23)
•  Renewable supply-demand balancing costs in 2050 are seen at around ¥353 billion/ year,
according to the Organization for Cross-Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO).

•  By 2050, renewable output is expected to double from the present. OCCTO’s base scenario for
this forecast is that power transmission lines won’t expand by 2050 and renewables will suffer
output curbs of up to 52%.
•  At a later date, OCCTO will release another forecast based on a scenario that transmission
networks are ramped up.
• TAKEAWAY: The cost estimates are very high and that is why METI is now pushing hard to allow the

installation of storage battery systems. Already, national and municipal governments are offering three dozen
subsidy programs in this space. However, energy storage systems require space and there are limits to their
capacities.
• Studies by the New Energy Foundation showed that if a 2 GW of storage capacity were added in Kyushu,

output curbs would fall by 1% in the region. As of today, the 0.5 GW energy storage system owned by Kyushu
Electric is Japan’s largest.



METI outlines technology roadmap for zero emission air travel
(Japan NRG, Aug. 25)
•  METI’s Green Innovation panel outlined a technology development roadmap to realize carbon
neutral air travel. Later in the 2020s, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will start to replace jet fuel of all

sized aircraft.
•  Battery-fueled small electric planes (up to 100 passengers, 30-90 minutes flight) will start flying in
late 2020’s.
•  Small planes with hydrogen fuel cells will start flying from 2025 and hydrogen engines will be
introduced in about 2035 for bigger planes (100-250 passengers and for 45-150 minute flights).
•  The Green Innovation fund is supporting development of hydrogen engines and new lightweight
materials.



Toyota, Tokyo Century win more JCM credits
(Government Statement, Aug. 22)
•  The Global Environment Centre Foundation (GEC) awarded offset credits under the Joint Credit
Mechanism framework to Toyota Motor, Tokyo Century, Dole group and Farmland for a total of
52,126 carbon tons.
•  This was Toyota’s eighth JCM project and 12th for Tokyo Century. Toyota built a 5 MW solar

system in Indonesia, earning 3,788 tons; and Tokyo Century a 1.6 MW solar system in Thailand for
595 tons.
•  A biogas/biomass project of Dole Group in Thailand earned 43,343 tons. Farmland built a 6 MW
solar system in Chile for 4,400 tons.
•  GEC will continue to assess other projects. Applications are open until November.
•  CONTEXT: Tokyo Century, Toyota, Sharp, Kansai Electric and Marubeni are the top JCM

participants, accounting for a quarter of approved projects.

Senegal joins Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM)
(Government statement, Aug. 25)
o  Senegal became the 18th nation to join the bilateral carbon credit framework, Joint

Credit Mechanism (JCM), a market offset mechanism under the Paris Agreement.
o  Credits generated from Japanese decarbonization projects in Senegal will be counted for
Japan’s nationally determined contribution (NDC). Tokyo aims to expand JCM to 30
nations by 2025.



Five companies to develop world’s first offshore ammonia storage facility
(Company Statement, Aug. 22)
•  NYK Line, Nihon Shipyard Co. (NSY), ClassNK, and IHI Corp (IHI) agreed on the commercialization
of an ammonia floating storage and regasification barge. It would be the world's first commercial-
scale facility of this kind.
•  An offshore floating platform will be able to receive and store ammonia transported via ship as a
liquid, and then regasify the ammonia based on demand, sending it to users such as thermal

power plants by pipeline.
• TAKEAWAY: The offshore facility eliminates the need to secure land, but construction of underwater pipelines
will likely require long regulatory processes as ammonia is defined as a toxic chemical regulated under Marine
Pollution Control Act.



Sharp to develop high-capacity zinc-air flow battery to cut storage costs
(Company Statement, Aug. 24)
• Sharp is developing a high-capacity
zinc-air flow battery to be released in
2025/26. Such a battery” can store a
great amount of electricity generated by

variable renewable sources, and
discharge it on-demand.
• While most conventional batteries
share a common part for storage and
cell, the zinc-air flow battery is composed
of a charging cell, a discharging cell and
storage space. The independent units

allow large-scale use at low price.
• What’s more compared with lithium-
ion, zinc is cheaper and easily available.
• Sharp’s technology was selected for

Toho Gas to install 70 MWh storage battery for trading power

(Company Statement, Aug. 19)
•  Toho Gas plans to install a 70 MWH sodium sulfide (NAS) storage battery system for connection to
the grid.
•  The company plans to trade power on the Japan Electricity Power Exchange.
•  Installation will start this month and the system will be operational in 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: 70 MWh is large. In fact, larger than the 51 MWh system of Hokkaido Electric that went
operational this year. Lithium-ion batteries are the mainstream technology but NAS and redox flow (RF)
systems are gaining traction due to high lithium prices.

• NAS batteries use sulfur for cathode, beta-alumina for solid electrolyte and sodium for anode, and do not
contain any rare metals such as lithium, nickel or cobalt. NGK Insulators is the world’s sole supplier of NAS
storage systems.

• A total of around 5 GWh of NAS system capacities have been built in over 10 countries including Japan, South
Korea, Germany, the UAE, the U.S. and Canada.

Boon for biomass? New wheat-rice variety developed without genetic engineering
(Japan NRG, Aug. 25)

o  A new crop variety that is half wheat and half rice was developed without modifying
genes. Credit goes to Professor Okamoto Takashi of Tokyo Metropolitan University.
o  Okamoto used microscopic fertilization techniques to mix egg of rice and wheat sperm.
Wheat, corn and rice do not typically mate.
o  The artificial fertilization generated a plant with a wheat core and mitochondrion of both
wheat and rice properties. It showed strong resistance to high temperatures.
o  This could be new biomass sources, food and animal feed.

o  CONTEXT: Thanks to genetically modified corn, bioethanol production improved in the
U.S. Japanese biotech companies are either licensing their technologies to overseas
companies or producing at overseas sites, due to strict regulatory control over

Japan Gas Association urges changes in LNG term contracts
(Japan NRG, Aug. 22)
•  A Japan Gas Association official urged removal of destination and sabotage clauses in LNG term
purchase contracts to cope with potential supply crunches. The association's senior managing
director, Hayakawa Koki, told METI’s working group on basic power and gas regulatory systems
that half of the outstanding contracts signed by Japanese buyers have destination clauses that

restrict delivery destination changes.
•  Sabotage clauses do not allow non-Japanese ships to transport LNG between local ports. Sharing
supplies would become easier if these clauses were eliminated, said Hayakawa.
•  Working group members said the contract parties could negotiate to relax the destination terms
aimed to prevent buyers from LNG sales to make profit.
•  The Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism could issue orders to allow foreign

ships to move cargoes between local ports, they also said.
• TAKEAWAY: In 2017, Japan Fair Trade Commission said that destination clauses may conflict with Japan’s
Antimonopoly Act, which is milder in tone compared to “potentially infringe the Act”. According to JOGMEC,
23% of fresh contracts signed after 2017 had destination clauses. A lack of follow-up LNG contract probes by
the competition watchdog shows it was not easy to establish a link between destination clauses and restraints
in competition.

ANALYSIS

BY CHISAKI WATANABE

Energy Efficient Buildings
To Be a Vital Aspect of Japan’s Net-Zero Strategy

Recent revisions to Japan’s law on energy efficient buildings are expected to boost
efforts to cut energy use, which in turn will create new opportunities to adopt better
technologies and introduce innovative business models.

The law changes come amid rising gas and electricity prices that so far have no end in
sight. Given the hardship consumers currently face, homeowners and tenants have a
strong incentive to use energy more efficiently.

In total, buildings account for about 30% of Japan’s energy consumption. Therefore,
efforts started years ago to target and decrease the sector’s emissions. For example, it
has been mandatory for new construction or renovations of non-residential buildings
of mid- and large-size to meet energy efficiency standards.

The impact of energy conservation could be as great as switching much of the power
generation system away from fossil fuels. So, the incentives for Japan to make
progress in the housing sector is significant.


New amendments
Japan’s housing regulations became even more encompassing in June when
Parliament amended the Act on the Improvement of Energy Consumption
Performance of Buildings. Beginning 2025, residential and small-size non-residential
buildings will also have to meet the same energy efficiency standards. For example,
insulation for exterior walls need to be thicker and windows must have double panes.

The amendments to the Act align with Japan’s target to achieve carbon neutrality by
2050. In August 2021, the government set the goal of net zero emissions for all new
buildings by 2030, and all new and existing buildings by 2050.

Tokyo has been pushing for energy conservation since 2009 when a study group on
net-zero emissions buildings was launched. The government set two criteria: Zero
Energy House (ZEH) for residential buildings, and Zero Energy Building (ZEB) for non-
residential buildings.

“ZEH” and “ZEB” are used as generic terms for buildings that aim to improve energy
efficiency, and do not necessarily mean they’ve achieved zero emissions status.
Rather, ZEB and ZEH come in different shades depending on the extent to which
energy use is cut and whether a building incorporates renewable energy.

The ZEH and ZEB standards require residential and non-residential buildings to
reduce energy use by more than 20% and 50%, respectively. Buildings that produce
as much renewable energy as they consume can qualify for the full ZEH and ZEB
status.

Adding hydrogen to the mix
To produce clean energy onsite, many buildings have installed solar panels on
rooftops. Builder Shimizu Corporation took a step forward by combining solar power
with hydrogen. Last year, its newly built office in Kanazawa city, Ishikawa Prefecture,
became the first net-zero emission building in the Hokuriku region.

It installed a system called Hydro Q-BiC to use excess solar power from 140 kW PV
panels to produce hydrogen through electrolysis, which will be absorbed in 2,000
kWh metal hydride alloys.

The hydrogen then will be used as electricity through a chemical reaction.

Shimizu says that hydrogen storage alloys are suitable for long-term and large-volume
storage. The company is looking into long-term energy management, for example,
producing hydrogen in spring and fall when power demand is lower, and using the
hydrogen in summer and winter to meet higher demand.

Among the advantages of metal hydride are:
o Hydrogen can be compressed to about 1/1000 of its original volume
o No self-discharge
o Easy to manage since material is not combustible
o Fewer regulatory restrictions


Third-party owners and ‘virtual’ solar plants
While solar panels play a key role in achieving the zero emissions status for residential
buildings, installation cost remains a concern. As one solution, there’s been an
expansion of third-party ownership of PV panels that homeowners can use without
paying for installation.

In March 2021, the government broadened the definition of ZEH to include
equipment owned by a third-party to qualify for subsidies. In a pilot program the

government this year will subsidize third-party owners to install panels on about 200
residential rooftops, providing a million yen each.

Companies are pursuing new business models involving residential buildings amid
increasing demand for clean energy certificates. In May, Nomura Real Estate
Development and TEPCO Energy Partner (TEPCO’s retail power seller) announced a
plan for a 1 MW virtual solar plant that aggregates solar power from the roofs of 300
new homes in the Tokyo area.

A homeowner can use solar power at a fixed rate and receive rooftop panels for free
at the end of a 10-year term. TEPCO Energy Partner will sell excess power to retailers
and supply Nomura credits and certificates for the rooftop solar's environmental
value.


Insulation first
For many homes, however, the starting point is insulation. Many residential buildings
in Japan lack sufficient insulation. They tend to be colder in winter and hotter in
summer than homes in other developed countries.

Another item that may have been underutilized is a solar water heater. Local
governments less frequently subsidize installing this at home, unlike PV panels.
However, solar thermal systems are usually less expensive than solar panels and have
a higher energy efficiency rate.

Hot water supply accounts for one-third of energy use at home, and hospitals and
hotels also use a lot of hot water. An August 2021 government report on the
decarbonization of buildings called for considering more use of solar water heaters to
reduce primary energy consumption further.

Energy efficiency is about incremental efforts and there’s not a single winning formula.
This means buildings will need to combine different measures currently available. The
reward for taking action is not only lower electricity bills, but also better preparedness
for blackouts if the building has equipment to produce and store energy.

ANALYSIS

BY MASAHIRO SUGIYAMA
AND YUHJI MATSUO

How Can Japan Overcome Obstacles to Adding More Renewables?

With the power system’s slim reserve margins in the summer and warnings of a
potential blackout under grueling temperatures, there’s a lively debate about the
roles of renewable energy (RE), fossil fuels, and nuclear energy in Japan’s power mix.

Whatever the short-term outcome may be, in the long run the power system will shift
away from fossil fuels to clean energy, with RE a main option because potentially it
could lead to lower cost and greater availability. But the exact shape of such a system
is highly contested primarily because of several factors unique to Japan.

Achieving a 100% RE system is challenging anywhere in the world, but especially in
Japan. But how much more difficult? And what are the key barriers, and how to solve
these issues?

With these questions in mind, on April 22 we held a panel discussion during a
symposium organized by the Japan Society of Energy and Resources. The main issues
analyzed were the high costs of RE in the short run, a weak grid system, and the high
population density and mountainous terrain.


High costs
First, the costs of renewables capacity are higher in Japan than elsewhere. Since the
beginning of the 2010s, the levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs) of solar and wind
power have been declining rapidly around the world. However, persistent high costs
in Japan slow the adoption of RE and put a burden on consumers.

For example, solar power costs about twice as much as in Germany, according to the
Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA), which has a roadmap to reduce the
cost of solar to the current German level by 2030. But by then, the German price may
be even lower.


System integration challenges
While integration issues are a challenge everywhere, Japan's grid is “weak” when it
comes to integration of renewables because of its poor interconnectedness (e.g., the
50 Hz frequency in the east and the 60 Hz frequency in the west), the lack of
international interconnection lines, and etc. This can lead to higher integration costs
and can be an obstacle to the deployment of RE.

When a large amount of RE is introduced in the grid, costs above the LCOE will be
added in the form of grid reinforcement, battery installation, or demand response.
Last year, the government estimated the LCOEs of key generating sources for 2030:
¥10.7/ kWh for LNG-fired; ¥11.7 /kWh for nuclear; and ¥11.2 /kWh for solar.

When the system integration cost is taken into
account, a different picture emerges for the cost
metric called the marginal system LCOEs: ¥10.3
/kWh for LNG; ¥14.5 /kWh for nuclear; and
¥19.9 /kWh for solar.

Thermal power generation, with its high
flexibility and adjustability, becomes cheaper
than solar PV. Note that these cost estimates
depend on the scenario assumption used in the
government estimate, and the cost could go up
with further introduction of renewables.

The system integration cost depends on a
number of factors, including the future cost of
Source: istock    demand responses (including vehicle-to-grid or V2G technology), the geographical
configuration of renewable development (distributed generation located near
demand centers vs. centralized supply transmitted over a long distance), and
regulations. Still, there are a number of hurdles. For instance, batteries may continue
to be expensive, just like solar, contrary to the global declining trend.


Limited RE potential in a high population-density country
In countries with a high population density, the supply of RE may be insufficient to
meet total energy demand. Moreover, with a higher population density, renewable
capacity will inevitably be placed where residents and stakeholders live. This implies
that NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) issues, including landscape and biodiversity
conservation, would be more prominent in Japan in the coming decades.

The Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry provided a scenario of
renewable capacity that takes into account aspects related to social acceptability,
including the fishery associations, national parks. In the case of offshore wind, the
consideration of such social factors greatly reduces the potential from 1,120 GW, (an
estimate by the Ministry of the Environment), to 322 GW, a reduction of roughly a
factor of three.

How to use a parcel of land is a societal choice, and none of these values is fixed.
Nevertheless, the challenge is deeper in Japan than in the U.S. or Europe. One needs
to consider societal implications of wide-scale renewable policy, be it an offshore wind
auction or a mandate of solar power installations in an urban area.


What should Japan do?
First, Japan lacks an open database of the costs of RE, and independent assessments
of such costs have been rare.

The government presents its cost analysis in the Calculation Committee for
Procurement Price. However, no independent and comprehensive analysis exists due
to the lack of open data. The government should open renewable-related data such
as the cost data of renewables under the FIT scheme.

Such data can be used for independent analyses and assessments of cost trends and
policy proposals. These types of analyses would help identify opportunities for cost
reductions, particularly with regard to strategic research programs such as the Green
Innovation Funds.

Second, in terms of both scenario analysis and societal visions the discussion around
a100% RE system should be properly placed in the broader discourse. The purpose of
scenario analysis is not to present a single, dominant scenario. Rather, it seeks to
inform by presenting a wide range of outcomes.

A better scenario framework would be not to present a single, RE-dominated scenario
but to present multiple scenarios with various RE barriers and enablers. A 100% RE
scenario should be considered alongside many other scenarios with nuclear,
hydrogen, ammonia, carbon capture and storage, among others.

Japan has enacted net zero into law, and the public might be committed, but would
the public really be open to a 100% RE system? Here, advocates and stakeholders
have to confront the hard reality of public sentiment. A 2021 global survey by Pew
Research Center shows that the concern about climate change decreased from 2015
to 2021 in a statistically significant manner only in Japan, among the many surveyed
countries.

Of course, public sentiment and understanding can change, and such a change may
be desirable. But that is up to the political establishment and public fora. Energy
analysts and researchers can help to have an open discussion by clarifying various
types of uncertainties, limitations to modeling, and also, inherent value judgments
involved in long-term policy analysis.

Overall, Tokyo has an opportunity to take the lead in articulating RE’s future.
Independent analysis and open discussion can chart a better course for the role of RE
in a high population-density country such as Japan. Since many countries, especially
those in Asia, face similar challenges, this is crucial not only in terms of Japan’s energy
transition but also in terms of global decarbonization.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Brazil/ Solar power
Energy infrastructure company Orion-E and energy trader Bolt plan to build solar
power plants with a combined generating capacity of 500 MW. The $628 million
project will be located in several states of Brazil.

Canada/ Green hydrogen
Chancellor Scholz and Prime Minister Trudeau signed an agreement in Newfoundland
at a site that’ll be the future home of a green hydrogen plant. German energy
companies already agreed to import Canadian hydrogen. The first deliveries are
expected in three years.

Coal markets
In a new report, the IEEFA predicts that coal prices will stay high due to war-induced
changes to trade flows. Also, due to disruptions in shipping schedules, Korea and
Japan will buy less Russian coal and instead buy from Indonesia and Australia. Also,
the report points out that Indonesian coal companies are not reinvesting in new coal
capacity.

India/ Oil
Chennai Petroleum formed a JV with parent company Indian Oil Corp to build a 9
mmt/ year refinery in Tamil Nadu. The $4 billion project will produce liquefied
petroleum gas, BS VI quality gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel.

India/ Renewable energy
Clean energy company ReNew agreed with 12 global lenders for a $1 billion loan. The
project will include 900 MW of wind capacity and 400 MW of solar PV deployed
across three Indian states. This is India’s biggest single-project clean energy deal to
date.

Norway/ Gas
Gas production levels will remain high until the end of the decade as Europe ends
Russian imports. Norway said that in 2022 it expects to produce 122 bcm of gas, an
8% increase over 2021, and possibly beating a record set five years ago.

Scotland/ Offshore wind power
Renewable energy company Mainstream Renewable Power and Ocean Winds were
tapped as the preferred bidder by Crown Estate Scotland to develop an area with the
potential to host up to 1.8 GW offshore wind capacity. It will be located off the
Shetland Islands.
UK/ Energy crisis
Keith Anderson, head of Scottish Power, one of the Big Six energy suppliers, told

government ministers that a plan to protect households from rising energy bills needs
funding of more than £100 billion over two years.

Ukraine/ Nuclear power
Rafael Grossi, head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog is "very close" to going to the
Russian-held Zaporozhye NPP, Europe’s largest by generating capacity. Media
reported that two units were disconnected following Kiev’s shelling of the NPP and
nearby area.

U.S./ LNG
Freeport LNG aims to return to 85% of production levels at its Texas plant by
December and to achieve full operation by March 2023. One of the largest U.S. LNG
exporters, Freeport halted operations in June after an explosion. An over-pressurized
pipeline was blamed.

Uzbekistan/ Renewable energy
ACWA Power, the Saudi power generation company, signed energy agreements with
the Uzbek government worth a total of $12 billion. These include the development of
a 1.5 GW wind farm in Karakalpakstan that could be Central Asia’s largest.
