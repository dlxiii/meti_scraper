Japan development bank launches $500m fund to grow wind sector

(New Energy Business News, Jan. 22)
•  The government-backed Development Bank of Japan and renewable energy provider Green
Power Investment (GPI) have formed the country’s first and largest fund for wind power
investments. It is set at ￥53 billion ($509 million) and is meant to help drive the expansion of the
domestic wind power industry.
•  The DBJ put in ¥13 billion of the money with the rest coming from GPI and institutional investors,
including Bank of Kyoto and other regional banks and insurers.
•  The new fund bought three wind farms and two solar energy projects operated by GPI, which have

a combined capacity of 220 MW. GPI will continue to manage them for at least 20 years, while
using proceeds from the sale to construct new wind farms.
•  CONTEXT: The government wants to help bring faster returns to the sector so that operators can
reinvest the money into new projects.



Sumitomo Corp to start producing “green” hydrogen in Australia

(Various, Jan. 22)
•  Trading house Sumitomo Corp has contracted engineering firm JGC Holdings to set up a
hydrogen production facility in Australia. The idea is to produce hydrogen using small solar-
powered electrolyzers.
•  The initial investment for the project is under ¥1 billion, which will create a small water electrolyzer
that’s the size of two shipping containers. This will make it easy to transport and install.

•  Initial project output will be 250-300 tons of hydrogen a year, powered by solar farms, which will
be enough for 3,000 fuel cell vehicles. The fuel will be sold to local factories and fuel cell buses.
•  Production is expected from 2023.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mitsubishi Heavy, Vattenfall, Shell mull “green” hydrogen plant in Germany
(Nikkei, Jan. 23)

o  The three companies and Hamburg Heat Supply Co. of Germany are looking at creating
a commercial hydrogen plant on the site of a closed coal-fired power plant. The new
facility would have 100 MW of electrolyzer capacity and be powered by wind and other
renewable energy.
o  Operations are planned for around 2025 with local ships likely to be the hydrogen
buyers.
• TAKEAWAY: The cost of producing green hydrogen has been the main sticking issue to its realization to date,

and yet the Sumitomo project, according to media reports, aims to have that cost down to A$2/kg, which
would be around a quarter of the European level. It seems that for the moment Japanese firms are scouring
the globe for the best test projects, many of which are linked to local supply as opposed to export potential
for Japan. However, once the test projects move to larger scale, we would expect the export potential to be a
factor in both project selection and investment. While trading firms like Sumitomo are working on the supply
side, engineering firms including Kawasaki Heavy, Chiyoda and Mitsubishi Heavy are considering how best to
transport the fuel. The basic outline for Japan’s hydrogen society is already starting to take shape.

Japan power companies’ LNG inventories start to recover, but still down YoY
(Bloomberg, Jan. 19)
•  LNG inventories of Japan’s major power utilities were at 1.91 million tons at the start of December
2020, due to higher-than-normal power demand, but by Jan. 11 that volume was down by about
half, according to a METI report.
•  The volumes have started to recover, however, and were already at 1.24 million tons on Jan. 17,

METI said.
•  METI report is available here, with LNG storage on p. 15.
• TAKEAWAY: The LNG inventory held by Japan’s big EPCOs in Jan. last year was 2.42 million tons. If the
inventories are now at 1.24-million-ton level, the drop would be almost 49% from las year.

• The full ministry data on LNG inventories is published with a two-three-month lag, and the most recent
officially released numbers (for Sept. 2020) are covered in the DATA section of Japan NRG. The more recent
numbers in this story are individual data points prepared in a separate METI report, and likely publicized to

Kansai Electric finally out of nuclear drought, hopes for Singapore LNG unit’s help
(Nikkei, Jan. 18)
•  Reactor 4 at Kansai Electric (KEPCO)’s Ohi nuclear power station has been restarted after being

shut down for inspection. This means that, for the first time in 2 1/2 months, KEPCO is producing
electricity from nuclear reactors.
•  Still, KEPCO is not out of the woods yet. Recent figures show KEPCO is reliant on LNG for 48% of
the electricity it supplies, some 11 points higher than the national average.
•  KEPCO hopes its Singaporean LNG trading subsidiary, established in 2017, will help it weather the
current crisis.

Hitachi’s fate in the hands of the power distribution business acquired from ABB
(Toyo Keizai, Jan. 23)
•  Hitachi’s acquisition of ABB Power Grids was due to three reasons: decarbonization,
decentralization, and digitization.

•  Although the Japanese power industry is conservative and dislikes using overseas products, VP of
Hitachi Nishino Toshikazu has reformed the company’s culture. He hopes to double the value of
ABB by 2024.
•  Whether Hitachi will be able to create synergy between ABB and Lumada is yet to be seen.
• TAKEAWAY: This is a long feature in a weekly magazine, and it covers many aspects of the ABB-Hitachi deal.
Still, one dichotomy that comes through in the story is the difference between Hitachi, which seeks to become

a more global, agile and progressive firm, and the conservative leaning of the Japanese electricity industry.
The power industry seems to wish to perpetuate the “all-Japan” familiarity, which involves having documents
and communications localized, and minor yet costly customizations. It would be tempting to assume that these
conservative attitudes are everywhere. The Hitachi example, however, and the emergency of new power
companies since 2011 shows that conservatism is not specifically a “Japan” issue and more a reflection of the
character of the country’s incumbent electricity utilities, which had never before been challenged in their own
markets. The pace of power reforms will depend on how well the progressive factions handle the conservative

attitudes.

METI select committee overwhelmingly pro-nuclear in defiance of public sentiment
(Tokyo Shimbun, Jan. 20)
•  CONTEXT: Tokyo Shimbun is the smallest of the big daily newspapers in Japan and has a left-

leaning viewpoint.
•  Despite a majority of the Japanese public calling for the phasing out of nuclear power, the METI
select committee in charge of reviewing the government’s energy policy has issued many
statements endorsing nuclear power.
•  Some committee members have expressed misgivings about the implications of pushing ahead
with policy supportive of nuclear power while remaining at odds with public opinion.
•  Many members of the committee, such as IHI’s Mizumoto Nobuko, have ties to the nuclear industry.

Mizumoto says that Japan must build new nuclear reactors in order to maintain expertise in the
industry.



High Court orders government to broaden Fukushima compensation
(Toyo Keizai Online, Jan. 20)
•  The outcomes of two trials about to start at the Tokyo High Court may force the Japanese

government to rethink its policy on nuclear power.
•  The plaintiffs, comprising134 persons from 54 households, are all former residents of disaster-
ravaged Fukushima who were forced to evacuate to other prefectures.
•  Because radiation levels in the area in question are less than 20 mSv per year, the government has
refused to pay compensation, saying this level of radiation presents no health risk.

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  An earlier Sendai High Court decision ordered the government to pay damages to residents after
finding that it failed to properly exercise its powers to ensure the safety of nuclear operations.
•  The government has appealed the Sendai High Court’s decision. If, rather than compensating the
victims of the disaster, the government decides to fight such court challenges to the bitter end, it is

sure to generate a public outcry.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
High Court finds in favor of government in nuclear disaster trial
(Tokyo Shimbun, Jan. 21)
o  On Jan. 21 the Tokyo High Court overturned an earlier decision that found the Japanese
government liable for damages incurred by former residents of Fukushima. The court
found that the government did not fail to properly guard against tsunami damage.

o  The Court found that liability for damages incurred by the residents lay solely with
TEPCO, which it ordered to pay a total of ¥120 million in damages to 90 of the 91
complainants in the suit. This is over ¥80 million more than the amount awarded in the
earlier, district court, trial.
• TAKEAWAY: The national government has so far managed to win some of the litigations brought before it
from former Fukushima residents. And yet, in this case, there is almost no scenario in which the government
can actually call this a “win”. Even if all the courts settle in its favor, on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the

Fukushima disaster the public scrutiny on the national government will be immense. Should all courts find that
TEPCO is the liable party, then it still leaves the bill on the government’s desk, since the utility is now state-
controlled. Given the money already expended on Fukushima area compensation, it seems odd that the
national government is even fighting these claims in the first place.




Joint venture partner sues TEPCO over dirty tactics
(Toyo Keizai, Jan. 22)
•  Panair, a service provider in the retail electricity and gas market, is suing TEPCO Energy Partners
for damages, claiming that TEPO poached its staff and passed off software developed by Panair as
its own.

•  The allegations involve PinT, a joint venture between TEPCO EP and Panair in which TEPCO holds

abruptly resigned from Panair despite his employer’s protests. He was subsequently hired by PinT,
an action that Panair says breached the terms of his non-poaching agreement.



Fukushima plant: Anomaly observed in reactor containment vessel

(NHK, Jan. 22)
•  TEPCO is investigating a drop in pressure in the containment vessel enclosing the Fukushima
nuclear plant’s Unit 1 reactor at around 6:30 pm on Jan. 21.
•  The incident happened when a “guide pipe”, which will house a camera used to inspect the
reactor, was being attached to the containment vessel.
•  Nitrogen is injected into the containment vessel under pressure to reduce the risk of explosion.
•  TEPCO says no radiation leak has been observed and denies that there is a safety issue.

Market share of new power retailers up in 2020; total number of retailers climbed
(Japan NRG, Jan. 24)
•  Market share of new entrants to the electricity retailing market rose during 2020. See chart below

published by the Basic Gas Policy sub-committee.
•  Total share was up at almost 20%, before dropping to 19.1% in Sept.
•  The new power retailers gained a 21.1% market share for low-voltage power (i.e., mostly
households) by Sept. 2020. This is up from zero as of April 2016.
•  The trend of the 10 major power utilities expanding their business outside of their original
geography has also continued. Some 4.2% of electricity sold in Japan last year came from the 10

power utilities acting outside of their “home” territory. As a consequence, the market share of the
10 power utilities selling electricity within their home territories shrank to 78.9% by Sept. 2020,
down from 94.8% five years earlier.

•  Mitsui & Co says it has agreed in principle to sell the entirety of its interests and investments in the
Mozambique Moatize coal mine, as well as related, rail and port infrastructure, to Brazilian mining

company Vale.
• TAKEAWAY: This move away from coal has been flagged by the CEO in an interview published at the turn of

•  In a world first, a Japanese team successfully extracted rare metals from the seabed 900 meters

below the ocean surface last year.
•  The government plans to perfect its extraction technology, and decide on drilling locations within
Japan’s exclusive economic zone, by 2028.
•  Japan currently relies on cobalt imports from politically unstable regions like the Democratic
Republic of Congo, but aims to source more of the mineral domestically.

Idemitsu to stop new investments in Australian coal business, eyes lithium mining

(Bloomberg, Jan. 18)
•  Idemitsu Kosan, the Japanese oil major, plans to stop making new investments in its coal business
in Australia, CEO Kito Shunichi said in an interview. Idemitsu has considered selling the business,
but believes it would be hard to do so in the current environment of heightened ESG awareness.
•  Coal demand will remain in the power sector of emerging economies, Kito said.
•  Idemitsu is also looking at ways to reorganize the coal business, including by exploring ways to

turn the mining sites into solar farms, or farms to cultivate crops for biomass.
•  Idemitsu also wants to enter the lithium mining business, Kito said.
•  Idemitsu plans to announce its net-zero emissions by 2050 target and roadmap when it posts
annual financial results in May, but it won’t be taking on Scope 3 emission pledges, Kito said.
•  Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels that can be used in aviation as a cleaner alternative, is another focus area
for the company, Kito said.
•  CONTEXT: Idemitsu is Japan’s No. 2 oil refining company and has three coal mines in Australia.

METI Looking for New Efficiency “Coal Benchmark” to Set Standards
for Coal-Fired Power Plant and Mark Evolution to Ammonia


In a bid to speed up decarbonization technology development while maintaining a
stable source of power, Japan will establish a new power efficiency target for coal-
fired power plants.

The current efficiency benchmarks have target metrics for oil, gas and coal-fueled
power plants combined. However, only by improving oil and gas power generation,
while emission from coal rises, has it been possible to achieve the targets. Coal’s lack
of efficiency has been cleverly concealed; thus, the government has decided that a
separate coal benchmark is needed.

The context here is that Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said
last July it wants to close down "inefficient" coal power plants by 2030. While it didn’t
give an official figure, media reported that 114 coal-fired units would be closed. Japan
has 150 coal-fired units and of those almost half are owned by manufacturers that use
the power for their own consumption while sending surplus to the grid.

The proposed coal benchmark involves 46 thermal power plant operators and won’t
require formal public endorsement. Yet, there must be clarity on how the benchmark
will relate to the 2030 goal. METI has a difficult challenge ahead - to balance various
stakeholder interests while setting new coherent rules on how to meet the 2030 goal
of removing "inefficient" coal power plants, as well as the 2050 net-zero goal.

The government’s goal is not to close all coal-fired power plants. In fact, on Jan. 8,
power company JERA brought on-stream a new coal-fired power plant in Ibaraki
prefecture. In addition, around 15 new coal-fired plants are expected to come online
in the coming years.

Rather, the country’s policy seeks to push existing coal power plants, both under-
performers and over-achievers, to continually improve power efficiency and reduce
carbon emissions. With this in mind, at the end of December, METI presented a rough
plan for a “coal efficiency benchmark” to the Coal-fired Thermal Plant Working
Group, an eight-member panel of the influential Energy Research Council. The coal-
efficiency benchmark targets 46 thermal power plant operators that include traditional
power utilities and manufacturers selling electricity to third parties.

Following months of bargaining with plant operators METI has proposed a “standard”
rather than singular numerical efficiency targets. Operators argue that flexibility is
needed because each power generator is different. Moreover, energy efficiency
numbers are not only dependent on generation type. As a rule, smaller plants and
those used more often enjoy higher efficiencies, a point METI’s new “standard”
approach tries accommodate.

METI’s criteria for the new standard are:
● 41%-46% power efficiency for plants that employ the “best available” technology

● 50% efficiency for plant operators that rank in the top 10-20% of the industry
The ministry argues that this standard exceeds the global benchmarks, which are
around 35%-40% energy efficiency.


The problems with a diplomatic approach
Already, the proposed new approach has sparked debate. Online panel members at
the Dec. 25 meeting questioned whether the standard should apply for each single
power plant, or on a company-wide basis.

One participant said that since METI’s model efficiency calculations are power plant-
based, the regulatory approach should also be based on each unit of generation.
Toshiyuki Sakamoto of the Institute of Energy Economics said there’s no point ranking
operators and setting top figures as the standard because operators might score
similar figures anyway.

The JERA power plant that came on-line on January 8 has the most advanced
desulfurization and dust filtering units and boasts power efficiency of 46%, which
appears to clear METI’s new proposed coal benchmark. However, the methodology to
measure the efficiency is not uniform — that 46% is based on JERA's calculations,
which are independent from METI.

The efficiency measurement methodology will likely be the next point of contention as
METI tries to sell the coal plant closures to the industry.


Adding ammonia into the equation
METI has tied to placate all sides so far, but this might become untenable as coal-fired
generation starts to include new elements, such as adding ammonia into the fuel mix
and adding carbon capture technology.

Already, operators have been told that they can factor in the use of clean fuels such as
biomass, ammonia and hydrogen into their thermal power plant efficiency numbers.

By METI’s own calculation, if ammonia and hydrogen comprised 10% of the primary
energy source, power generation efficiency would rise by 4%.

This opens the possibility of old and inefficient coal-fired plants adding a clean fuel
into the mix and gaming the efficiency numbers through co-firing. If small, busy coal
plants are re-engineered also to burn ammonia, will METI still insist on the 114 plant
closures?

For the foreseeable future and until 2030, the date by which METI said it wants to
enact the coal plant closures, it will be unrealistic to expect hydrogen and ammonia to
account for 10% or more of Japan’s fuel mix. The rollout of the new benchmark may
also require revisions to METI ordinances, and changes are likely to be bundled with
other regulatory reforms required for carbon neutrality.

Still, the success of any regulation depends on clarity of its rationale and consistency
of implementation methodologies. Decarbonization is a continuous process and its
policies need to last for the next three decades. For METI to sell the new coal
benchmark to all stakeholders, not just the power industry, it will need to outline how
hydrogen, ammonia, carbon capture and other technologies will affect the rules.

Meanwhile, METI has another urgent deadline. The ministry has to deliver a new
energy strategy by summer that will outline, among other things, the allocation for
coal-fired generation in the country’s energy mix.

Japan's idea of "out-phasing coal" may in fact mean giving longer life to coal
power plants under the name of "being efficient".

Government Vision for Offshore Wind Does Not Lack Ambition,
But May Lack Price Incentives as Operators Weigh Risk-Return Picture


At the end of last year, Japan held its first power capacity auction for offshore wind
under the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) scheme. A total of 120 MW was on offer. There was only
one bidder, however, for 4.8 MW of fixed bottom wind capacity. It didn’t win.

This first auction of its kind in Japan did not disclose the price cap on offer, which
explains why the only entrant failed. Even if the auction were a success, it would have
made little dent in the recently unveiled government plan to build as much as 45 GW
of offshore wind capacity in Japan within two decades. And yet, the results of this
auction, aimed at small projects outside of the “core” offshore wind promotion zones,
is further evidence of a worrying disconnect between government ambitions and
industry expectations.

The 2050 Green Growth Strategy published at the tail end of 2020 calls for ¥8/ kWh
wind power prices as soon as 2030. The sole bidder in the FIT auction mentioned
above sought ¥1 more than the event’s ¥34 price ceiling, itself a more generous cap
than what’s on offer for bigger offshore wind developments.

As per the government’s own comment in the Strategy, competition among Asian
countries to welcome offshore wind developments and secure turbine supply is
becoming “fierce”. The margins in Japan, coupled with local supply chain risks, are
starting to give some wind developers pause for thought.


Government publishes vision for offshore wind
Japan had about 4.4 GW of wind capacity installed as of mid-2020. Even if all wind
projects currently under development and FIT-approved are completed, that number
will reach just 11.6 GW.

So, when the government published its Green Growth Strategy on Dec. 25, its vision
for the offshore wind development was nothing if not revolutionary. Not only did the
Strategy call for Japan to have 8% of an expected 526 GW of global offshore wind
capacity by 2040, it selected this energy source as the nation’s No. 1 priority. Offshore
wind sits at the top of the Strategy’s to-do list.


What government promises to do to speed up offshore wind
development

• Streamline regulation, such as collating the safety inspection carried out by
METI and the assessments from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,

Transport and Tourism

• Review of how to create a better power transmission network that will
connect offshore wind sites with high-power-demand areas

• Update port infrastructure regulations to make sure that large wind
turbines can be transported around the country

• Distribute financial support to companies that enter the local supply chain
for wind power from the new ¥2 trillion-yen green tech fund




There are good reasons to focus on offshore wind. It promises to deliver dozens of
GWs of emissions-free electricity and could power facilities that generate hydrogen.
Offshore wind, alongside nuclear and hydro, are estimated to be the lowest carbon
intensity options for powering hydrogen products, according to a recent assessment
completed by the Canadian government.

Floating offshore wind turbines is also a field that currently has no global leaders and
could be a business opportunity with future export potential for Japanese
shipbuilders, according to the Green Growth Strategy.

However, while the government’s vision lays out precise numerical targets for offshore
wind, it also makes some very risky assumptions.

•  The headline 45 GW numbers, according to a footnote in the Strategy, is based on
the idea that floating wind power stations are realized on a commercial scale in Japan
and become cost-competitive. At the same time, the government admits that the
introduction of floating wind turbines is likely to start only from around 2040.

•  The 2030 interim capacity target is for 10 GW. However, the first auctions for large
offshore wind projects (see details below) will only announce winners later in 2021.
Some 1.5 GW of projects should get the green light sometime this year, as per the
Strategy document. Factoring in time for environmental, safety and other
assessments, Japan will need to auction another 8.5 GW of offshore wind capacity in
the following two to three years.

•  Popularization of offshore wind in Japan is predicated on the premise that price will
drop similar to the way wind power costs have almost halved globally in the past 10
years. A main reason for cheaper wind in Europe, for example, is local wind turbine
component manufacturing. Similarly, Japan’s government wants the bulk of
components to be made at home, but its 60% localization target is set for 2040. While
that may be a sensible timeline in terms of creating a domestic supply chain from
scratch, it means parts localization will not be playing the main role in cutting Japan’s
offshore wind power prices to ¥8-¥9/ kWh by 2030 – 2035 (from the ¥34-¥36 level
today).

•  So, if component costs are not the main driver, what will be the main cost-cutting
factor over the next 10 years? The Green Growth Strategy doesn’t give a direct

answer, but offers a hint: foreign wind players working in tandem with Japanese
companies both in Japan and elsewhere. The Strategy goes as far as to promise state
support, including financing, to Japanese companies that engage in offshore wind
projects abroad.

•  The Strategy barely addresses one of the key cost factors: the availability and price of
raw materials.
o As covered in the Jan. 18 edition of Japan NRG, prices of metals
required for renewable energy are surging. Copper rose from less than
$5,000 / ton in March 2020 to over $8,000 this January, and is expected to
be close to $10,000 by the end of this year. The market expects a copper
deficit this year, and yet it’s almost irreplaceable for offshore wind
installations that require 11.5 tons of copper per MW of capacity – ten times
the volume for a gas-fired plant.

o Meanwhile, Japan’s reliance on China for critical raw materials (CRMs)
remains extremely high at 58%. Risk of geopolitical tensions aside, China
has its own major ambitions for renewable energy and will prioritize CRM
supply for own projects. (For reference, China registered an additional 72
GW of wind power capacity last year alone.) Japan’s strategy notes the
government’s intent to “promote efforts to secure raw materials such as rare
earths,” but offers no detail on how this well-known problem will be tackled.

•  Another cost factor mostly overlooked by the Strategy is the “local tax,” or the money
that operators are asked to pay by local business groups, such as the fishermen
unions, to acquiesce to construction. In some areas, fishermen have asked for as much
as 1% of wind electricity sales income as compensation for potential loss of catch and
inconvenience.


Near-term developments
While the FIT auction mentioned at the beginning is aimed at projects in the 30 MW
range and less, the vast majority of offshore wind developments in Japan will initially
take place in four designated areas. (See the next page for a map). These are: off the
coast of Akita prefecture (the Noshiro, the Yurihonjo City North and the Yurihonjo City
South zones); Chiba prefecture (near Choshi City); and Nagasaki prefecture (near Goto
City).

In addition, zones in Aomori and Hokkaido prefectures are seen as good candidates
for auctions in the near term.

The first auction for development of a large project in the Akita and Chiba zones
opened on Nov. 27, 2020, with the results due by May 27, 2021.

In addition, Japan will publish a detailed roadmap for technical development in
offshore wind during this year, according to the Strategy.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Oil:
On Monday, the IEA revised down its forecast for global oil demand by 0.6 mb/d for
1Q21, and 0.3 mb/d for FY2021, due to the prolonged impact of the pandemic. IEA
now projects world oil demand will rise by 5.5 mb/d this year to 96.6 mb/d, following
last year!s 8.8 mb/d contraction. They also predict world oil supply will rise by over 1
mb/d this year, with OPEC+ adding more barrels than those outside OPEC. In 2019
world oil demand was 100 mb/d and world oil supply was 95 mb/d.

Pipelines:
1). President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline permit on day 1 of his
administration. The $8 billion pipeline was expected to transport over 800,000 b/d of
Albertan oil across the U.S.-Canadian border to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Jason Kenney, the Alberta premier, has called for retaliatory sanctions against the U.S.
JAPEX, Japan!s third largest oil and gas company, has investments in Albertan oil
sands. Canadian oil prices hit a low of $8 in March but have since recovered to $40.
2). The German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which will host the
endpoint of Nord Stream 2, the Russian pipeline that will transport natural gas to
Germany, has launched an environmental foundation to overcome U.S. objections to
the pipeline. Gazprom, the owner and operator of the pipeline, will invest E20 million
in the foundation.

Coal:
BHP wrote down the value of its coal assets by an incremental $1.3 billion in 4Q20.

EVs:
1). Renault, the French automaker, committed to further EV investments as part of its
"Renaulution#!strategy announced last Thursday that aims to cut E3 billion in costs and
generate E6 billion in incremental cash flow by 2025 and unwind the Carlos Ghosn
strategy. Renault has a 44% voting stake in Nissan, which in turn has a 15% non-voting
stake in Renault.
2). Rivian Automotives, the U.S. EV start-up, raised $2.7 billion in new funding last
week. Amazon and Ford are investors in Rivian.

over 30% due to plans to expand EV platforms.

Palm Oil:
1). Palm oil prices touched $961 a ton this month, the highest level since 2011, due to
production shortages caused by pandemic lockdowns. Palm oil is used extensively for
the production of biodiesel.
2). Malaysia and Indonesia, the two major palm oil producers, have also joined forces
in an advocacy campaign in Europe to overcome tight EU regulations.

Wind Energy:
Clarksons, the shipping broker, estimates that investments in global shipping fleets to
service the 26,000 offshore wind turbines expected to be in place by 2030 will need
to almost double to $23 billion by 2025.

Carbon Capture and Storage ("CCUS!):
Occidental Petroleum claimed last week that its annual injections of 20 million tons of
CO2 exceed Tesla!s greenhouse gas emissions credentials. Occidental claims that
their CCUS injections are equivalent to taking four million cars off the road. Tesla sold
500,000 EVs in 2020. Occidental!s share price has halved over the last 12 months and
its market capitalization is now 2.5% of Tesla!s.

Energy Storage:
1). The Biden administration is expected to introduce an investment tax credit for
energy storage as part of their green energy policy plans.
2). The price of nickel has risen by 70% over the last nine months to $18,410 per ton
as EV sales grow and more nickel is required for battery production.

Airlines:
Last week, United Airlines and Delta Airlines announced combined losses of $20
billion for 2020 as the industry struggles through the worst crisis in its history. Demand
for jet fuel is expected to remain sluggish.

China:
China sanctioned 28 members of the outgoing Trump administration last week
including Keith Krach, the former under secretary of state for energy and the
environment, at the State Department. The sanctions prohibit travel to China and
doing business with China. In December the EU signed a Comprehensive Agreement
on Investment with China which is the subject of some tension between the U.S. and
the E.U. Also, China continues to be the major investor in the two nuclear power
projects at Hinkley and Sizewell in the U.K.

India:
1). France!s Total has acquired a 20% stake in Adani Green Energy for $2.5 billion. The
deal will include a 50% share in a 2.35 GW solar asset portfolio.
2). The Renew Oceans project in the city of Varanasi that was meant to deal with the
plastic waste crisis has been terminated due to constraints caused by the pandemic.
The project was funded by some of the world!s largest oil and gas companies.

Russia:
Trafigura has announced a $7.3 billion 10% investment into Vostok Oil, a Siberian oil
project, that is expected to produce 1 million b/d by 2028. Oil from the project will be
sold into the EU and Asia via the northern sea route. The deal has been partially
financed by the Credit Bank of Moscow. The investment underlines Trafigura!s strong
commitment to Russia and Rosneft.

UAE:
Sultan Al Jaber, head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, aims to raise UAE oil
production by over 60% to 5mb/d by 2030 as other oil majors retreat. UAE is currently
OPEC!s third largest producer after Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

company, after Veolia took a 30% stake last October.

Germany:
Volkswagen will pay an E100 million fine for failing to meet the EU emissions
reduction target of 100 grams of CO2 per km driven last year. Despite this setback,
VW still plans to sell 26 million EVs this decade.

Mexico:
CFE, the state electricity company, has attributed the cause of December!s major
power outage in Mexico City, which impacted 10.3 million users, to intermittent
renewable energy.

U.S.:
1). The State of New York ("NY!) has opened bidding on three high voltage
transmission projects including a 330-mile line running from the Canadian border to
Manhattan as it seeks to bolster its transmission infrastructure as part of a target to
achieve 70% renewable energy by 2030. President Biden has also appointed Al Zaidi,
the chairman of NY!s climate policy division, as his deputy national climate adviser.
2). On Wednesday, President Biden commenced the process for the U.S. to re-enter
the Paris Agreement and instructed federal agencies to reinstate more than 100
