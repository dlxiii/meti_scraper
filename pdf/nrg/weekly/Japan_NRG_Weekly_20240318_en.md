NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Govt proposes to amend Marine Renewable Energy Act to include EEZ

(Government statement, March 12)
•  The Cabinet proposed an amendment to the Act on Promoting the Utilization of Sea Areas for the
Development of Marine Renewable Energy Power Generation Facilities, to include exclusive
economic zones (EEZ) in its scope.
•  The proposal added a new chapter four on offshore wind projects in the EEZ:
o  Defining prohibited acts;
o  Defining the METI Minister as the sole authority to designate project locations in the EEZ;
o  The Environment Minister can conduct environmental impact surveys upon METI

Minister’s request;
o  METI and MLIT ministers can issue project licenses and set up stakeholder councils.
•  The amendment also reaffirms that developing renewables in the EEZ is Japan’s right as stated in
the U.N. Convention on Law of the Sea.
•  CONTEXT: Japan government targets seek 10 GW of offshore wind projects by 2030, and 30-45
GW by 2040. The current law has no provisions for projects in EEZ waters.

• TAKEAWAY: The amendment aims to promote offshore wind installations in the EEZ but is not limited to that.
The law would be applicable to any renewable projects in the EEZ. Separately, the Defense Ministry has
proposed a new law to set aside zones that are crucial for defense wireless communications. Defense officials
want the power to mandate that wind facilities that are cited with their zones also meet the Defense Ministry’s
requirements.




Govt approves plan to make Hokkaido a hub for chips and renewable energy tech

(Government statement, March 12)
•  The govt approved a 10-year development plan to expand renewables and create bases for
advanced industries such as semiconductors and data centers in Hokkaido.
•  The main goal is for Hokkaido to support revitalizing the national and regional economies by
ensuring food security, tourism revival and carbon neutrality, as well as urban development of
Hokkaido.
•  CONTEXT: The plan will also address socioeconomic changes due to COVID-19, including the loss

of tourism, soaring energy and food prices, supply concerns, as well as the need to meet 2050 net-
zero goals. The govt plans to invest further in wind and hydrogen power generation.

Idemitsu reports successful test of ammonia as naphtha cracker fuel
(Company statement, March 15)
•  Over Feb 6-8, Idemitsu Kosan conducted an ammonia co-firing test at the Tokuyama refinery,
using fuel with over 20% ammonia content, to run a commercial naphtha cracker for ethylene

production. It proved ammonia can be used to run crackers.
•  Idemitsu also said the release of nitrogen oxide compounds met environmental standards. The
ammonia had no negative impact on the cracker performance.
•  This was Japan’s first operation of an ammonia-fueled naphtha cracker.
•  CONTEXT: The Tokuyama cracker has an annual ethylene production capacity of 623,000 tons and
is a key ethylene production site. Idemitsu did not say what was mixed with ammonia, but methane
is the usual fuel for naphtha crackers.

• TAKEAWAY: Naphtha crackers have the potential to be the second largest ammonia consumers after coal
power stations. Japan’s total annual ethylene output capacity comes to 6.2 mln tons, and ten companies
including Idemitsu own naphtha crackers. Idemitsu runs an older cracker in Chiba and it will be interesting to
see if ammonia can be introduced there.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Idemitsu takes stake in Australian SAF producer
(Company statement, March 13)
o  Idemitsu Kosan acquired a stake in Jet Zero Australia, a SAF producer with projects in
Queensland.
o  Details of the investment, including a percentage share, were not disclosed.

o  In Q1 2027, Jet Zero plans to bring onstream the 100,000 tons / year PJ Ulysses plant,
producing SAF from bioethanol using the alcohol to jet (ATJ) process.



Sekisui to finalize bendable solar investment decisions in two years

(Nikkei, March 13)
•  Sekisui Chemical President Kato Keita said that capacities, the number of manufacturing lines and
other details of Perovskite solar cell investments will be finalized in one or two years. The company
plans to commercialize PSCs in 2025.
•  He needs to determine whether state support is possible if his company were to provide a large
amount of PSC module supplies from the launch phase.
• TAKEAWAY: METI plans to add PSC-derived solar power service to the FIT starting in 2025. Unlike industrial

plants introducing PSC systems for in-house use, power service providers need to ensure accountability of their
services to customers. Hence, the role of Sekisui and other module manufacturers goes beyond simply
supplying modules. Providing reliable performance data for revenue forecasts and insurance policies is also
important.

CEO of startup discusses laser-powered fusion energy
(Nikkei Asia, March 11)
•  CONTEXT: This is an interview with Matsuo Kazuki, the CEO of EX-Fusion, a startup specializing in
laser-powered fusion energy.
•  Matsuo explains laser-powered nuclear fusion, which involves using high-powered lasers to heat

and compress fuel pellets to induce fusion reactions.
•  Japan has a notable presence in laser fusion research, alongside the U.S. and France. Matsuo
emphasized Osaka University's research on the fast-ignition method, which involves compressing
fuel before heating it with more laser beams.
•  Despite the potential of laser fusion, Matsuo admitted significant technical obstacles to
commercialization. He sees broader application for high-intensity laser technology beyond fusion.

•  Matsuo highlighted positives such as upcoming state support, in particular a program to boost
fusion regardless of reactor type.



Hitachi Zosen signs MoU with Oman LNG on methanation

(Company statement, March 12)
•  Hitachi Zosen Corp and Hitachi Zosen Inova inked an MoU with Oman LNG to install methanation
equipment in LNG plants and to use emitted CO2 as a resource.
•  The MoU involves the study and potential construction of a small pilot plant next to an existing
LNG plant, aiming to produce 1,200Nm³/h of e-methane.
•  Hitachi Zosen can count on METI's FY2024 subsidy program to support oil refining technology
projects in major oil-producing countries.

•  CONTEXT: Inpex and Osaka Gas set a goal of producing e-methane starting from FY2025. Tokyo
Gas and Mitsubishi Corp have plans for starting a large-scale manufacturing plant in the U.S. in
2029.
• TAKEAWAY: It is not clear if Japan will import the e-methane produced by the project since discussion on
price and other factors are ongoing. Oman has a smaller output compared to other nations that produce oil
and gas.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hitachi Zosen Inova acquired majority stake in Italian biogas supplier
(Company statement, March 7)
o  Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI) acquired a majority stake in Schmack Biogas, an Italian supplier

and constructor of biogas and biomethane plants. The deal saw PLC selling its 51%
stake, while the remaining shareholders retained a minority share.
o  Schmack Biogas has built around 70 biogas/biomethane plants in Italy and other
countries.

Mitsubishi Kakoki wins hydrogen equipment contract from Nippon Steel
(Company statement, March 13)
•  Mitsubishi Kakoki Kaisha will deliver hydrogen manufacturing equipment to Nippon Steel to study
if it’s feasible to replace coke with hydrogen in the process of separating metallic iron from iron

ore.
•  The company will provide two hydrogen production systems, each with a capacity to make 37,500
Nm3/ hour of hydrogen, enough to supply 1,200 FCVs. Nippon Steel will build a small pilot blast
furnace that will link with the hydrogen equipment.
•  JFE Steel, Kobe Steel and Japan Research and Development Center for Metals also take part in
the study.
•  CONTEXT: The study is funded by NEDO’s Green Innovation Fund, and its goal is to develop iron

reduction processes that will cut emissions by over 50% by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: Mitsubishi Kakoki’s equipment employs a process called steam reforming that uses natural gas as
feedstock and releases carbon while producing hydrogen. However, the current cost of green hydrogen makes
steelmaking much more expensive and metal firms fear their customers will not accept such price increases.




Tanaka to replace 25% of Shonan plant power requirement with FC power
(Company statement, March 12)
•  Tanaka Precious Metal will install two 500 kW hydrogen fuel cell systems at its Shonan plant.

They’ll supply 25% of power when the plant launches in April 2026.
•  Tanaka chose H2Rex systems made by Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions, which will possibly be
Japan’s largest hydrogen-derived power generation systems in the private sector, said Tanaka.
•  CONTEXT: Tanaka believes that annual emission cuts of 1,979 metric tons will result from the ¥2
billion investment into the FC systems.
• TAKEAWAY: Tanaka’s base assumption is that the FC systems release zero carbon, which is currently the

national carbon accounting rule applied to FC vehicles. However, this rule may change as METI plans to
promote the use of hydrogen with a low carbon footprint, rather than just any hydrogen.




MHI secures license for CC tech at UK hydrogen production plant
(Company statement, March 12)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) secured a license from Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) to provide
carbon capture technology for a low carbon hydrogen production plant in Cheshire, UK.
•  This plant, part of the HyNet CCUS cluster, will have an annual production of 230,000 tons. The

captured CO2 will be sequestered into depleted subsea gas fields.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Epson to develop tech for carbon capture and fixation
(Nikkei, March 12)
o  Epson is intensifying efforts to develop technology for capturing and fixing CO2. The
goal is to achieve "carbon minus" status by 2050 where it absorbs more CO2 than

emitted. Epson plans to use thin-film technology for CO2 recovery and is focusing on
fine algae for CO2 fixation.
o  Additionally, the firm aims to use the recovered CO2 as a resource for new products.
Epson intends to operate a biomass power plant in Nagano Pref by 2026, and sees this
as an opportunity to use CO2 separation technology.




Toray develops high-conductivity membrane for next-gen batteries, EVs
(Company statement, March 11)
•  Chemical firm Toray Industries developed an ion-conductive polymer membrane for next-gen

batteries that has 10 times higher ion conductivity than existing products.
•  The polymer membrane has been designed to speed up the practical application of metallic
lithium anode batteries – all solid-state and air batteries. It can also be used in EVs, industrial
drones and urban air mobility (UAM).
•  CONTEXT: As the electrification of mobility progresses, LIBs are required to achieve higher energy
density, prompting firms to develop next-gen batteries using metallic lithium. However, due to its
traits such as strong surface reactivity, metallic lithium can easily lead to short circuits, and partly

for that reason it has yet to be applied to anodes in all-solid-state batteries.



IHI, Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand ink energy transition MoU

(Company statement, March 13)
•  IHI and the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand signed a MoU to study energy transition, carbon
neutrality and manpower reduction at industrial zones in Thailand.



METI Minister, senior advisor to U.S. president discuss energy transition
(Government statement, March 14)
•  METI Minister Saito met with John Podesta, senior advisor to the U.S. President and discussed the

possible synergy between Japan’s Green Transformation (GX) and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act,
to build sustainable clean energy supply chains.



TEPCO suspends treated water release after earthquake

(Kyodo, March 15)
•  TEPCO suspended the release of treated water into the sea after a 5.8 earthquake hit Fukushima
Pref and other areas in northeastern Japan. The Fukushima Daiichi NPP facility and other local
NPPs were unaffected.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

14 Japanese firms partner on floating wind power generation

(Japan NRG, March 15)
•  Fourteen Japanese firms launched a consortium to promote offshore wind power, working on tech
to be used for platforms and platform components.
•  Their work will be partly financed by METI, with members also set to invest. They include NTT
Anode Energy, J-Power, Eurus Energy, Kansai Electric, TEPCO and Marubeni and Mitsubishi Corp.
•  CONTEXT: Formation of this group comes right after the govt approved the draft amendment to
the law governing Japan’s EEZ. The govt has allocated ¥4 billion to support floating offshore wind

tech, with an additional ¥400 billion to be funded through GX bonds for supply chains. With
further development, the govt aims to select operators for up to 45 GW of offshore wind power
facilities by 2040, and floating platforms are expected to be the main technology.
•  There are four major types of floating platforms under development in Japan and overseas. The
consortium is set to work on tech compatible with all those types – spar buoy, tension leg platform,
semi-submersible platform and barge.
• TAKEAWAY: Conditions in the EEZ require structures suitable for deep waters as wind turbines can’t be fixed

to the seabed. Such tech is costly, and since it’s still fledgling a much deeper understanding of environmental
conditions is required to select adequate structures; each of the four types of floating turbine platforms
impacts motion characteristics and the entire wind turbine from nacelle to dynamic cables. Such know-how in
Japan is still limited and cooperation in developing such tech will be crucial to future progress.




Minister to ask Niigata governor to support restart of TEPCO’s nuclear plant
(Niigata Nippo, March 15)
•
METI Minister Saito will next week request Niigata Governor Hanazumi Hideyo to endorse the
restart of Unit 7 of TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station. The minister is planning a
visit to the prefecture on March 21 to explain the central government’s position face to face.
•
The governor’s approval is one of the last hurdles before the nuclear plant can resume operations.
Late last year, it was cleared for operation by the regulator.
•  Minister Saito met with TEPCO President Kobayakawa on March 15 and said he would soon
convey his support for the restart and stress its necessity to “the leaders of the prefecture,
Kashiwazaki City, and Kariwa Village."
• TAKEAWAY: Local media reported this as the first time the national govt directly requested the restart of a

nuclear power plant (after the NRA signed off on it). In some ways, METI might be keen to appear more
assertive and believes the time is right to put more pressure on local authorities to green light nuclear restarts.
In reality, the Tokyo bureaucracy does not need local approval, but tradition has dictated that this ritual be
observed. In the case of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa facility, the situation is far more delicate than at any other NPP

in Japan because it’s TEPCO’s only operable nuclear plant. TEPCO has made a number of small and not-so-
small errors in recent years in trying to get the station back online. So, consciously or otherwise, the Niigata
governor has tried to stall his approval for as long as possible. His latest idea was to call for a local election so
he could ask for a local mandate for the restart. But METI and the Cabinet are clearly uninterested in allowing
local intrigues to play out further. How Minister Saito addresses the Niigata governor could send a message to

other “holdout” governors with NPPs nearby.




EPCOs forecast higher FY2024 renewable output curb
(Government statement, March 11)
•  The regional electric power utilities, (EPCOs), forecast higher renewables output curbs in FY2024
compared to the previous year, with the exception of Kyushu Electric. They cite lower power
demand and an increase in nuclear power supplies as the reasons for higher curtailment
projections.

•  Kyushu Electric, however, expects a lower curb rate due to fewer sunny days forecast for FY2024.

Output curb rate forecast by major utility

ANRE discusses electricity system reform, regulatory tariffs, etc
(Denki Shimbun, March 14)
•  An ANRE expert meeting on March 13 discussed the reform and full liberalization of the electricity
retail market.
•  In light of rising power prices in the market over the past two years, TEPCO Energy Partners
President Nagasaki requested the review of regulated rates to be accelerated so that utilities can

respond more flexibly to changes in market conditions. Without this, it is difficult to make new
investment decisions, she said.
•  A managing executive officer from Osaka Gas also raised the issue of regulated rates, saying, "We
need a mechanism to reflect fuel price increases in regulated rates.”
•  ANRE and regulator EGC officials aired results of market feedback around how the sector is
functioning since its full liberalization in 2016. Among the opinions gathered were calls for an early
abolition of regulated tariffs and a review into the impact of major power utilities moving to non-

discriminate / equal wholesale sales of electricity to retailers and PPS (naigai musabetsu).
•  AU Energy Holdings President Nakagiri said that "progress in liberalization has stalled," especially
calling into question the situation in the low-voltage segment.
• TAKEAWAY: There’s a lot of frustration building up in the electricity sector because prices and tariffs are not
entirely reflecting the rising costs of generation. METI was supposed to move the electricity sector to an
entirely market footing, but has kept a number of mechanisms in place from earlier, such as regulated tariffs for
a portion of the electricity sales by major utilities. This simultaneous existence of market prices and

TOCOM  launches weekly electricity futures contract

(Company statement, March 13)
•  From March 18, TOCOM will offer a weekly electricity futures contract in addition to the monthly
product. The exchange seeks to capture growing demand for short-term hedging and trades.
•  The weekly baseload contract covers a seven-day period starting from Saturday. The weekly
intraday contract starts on Monday. Both weekly contracts cover the same area as their
corresponding segments on the JEPX wholesale marketplace.
•  Trading in the weekly baseload contract is open within a five-week window that includes the week
in question. One unit of trading is equivalent to 16.8 MWh, representing 24 hourly slots over seven

days at 100 kWh each. The weekly intraday contract covers 6 MWh.
•  TOCOM will also add a market maker system for a limited period from April to June to increase
liquidity in the futures market. This will allow designated securities firms and others to
simultaneously issue bids and offers at a set time.
•  CONTEXT: The move is in response to calls mainly from new power companies, for the creation of
shorter-duration products. The major utilities can also benefit by using the weekly contracts to
cover power plant shutdowns.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TOCOM sees lowest contracted volume on record in January
(Denki Shimbun, March 11)
o  In January, TOCOM's electricity futures market saw a 62.5% MoM decline in contract
volume to 15.24 GWh, the lowest since listing in April 2022.
o  Electricity demand decreased due to warmer weather. This, combined with a softening

LNG market and low prices in the spot market, dampened the need for hedging.
o  TOCOM’s East Baseload contract for January averaged ¥10.39; it was ¥9.39 for West
Baseload.
o  Off-auction trading dropped below 30% of contract volume. Only three deals were
executed at 100 lots. Open interest at January end was 175.35 GWh, down 27.3% from
the previous month.

Most wind farms in earthquake-hit Noto area remain offline
(Tokyo Shimbun, March 11)
•  Most of the 73 wind turbines (capacity 130 MW) on the Noto Peninsula, Ishikawa Pref, which went

offline in the wake of the Jan 1 quake, have yet to restart. Only 9 have been switched back on so
far.
•  It’s even unclear when at least half of the rest will become operational. The halt also impacts
projects still in the pipeline – 181 turbines with a total capacity of 730 MW are slated to be built in
the area.
•  CONTEXT: Ishikawa has 74 wind farms, of which 73 are in the Noto area. The remaining one has
been offline since 2017. This is reportedly the first time that a quake has left broken blades. Access

to most of the area’s wind farms, particularly in Suzu and Wajima cities, is limited and the situation
can be only confirmed by using drones or a zoom lens.

IEEFA releases report on Japan’s drop in LNG demand
(Anadolu Energy, March 11)
•  The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis forecast that Japan's LNG demand is

likely to continue declining, which will lead to excess supply for utilities through 2030.
•  Utilities like JERA, Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, and Kansai Electric will face an over-contracted position
of roughly 11 mtpa of LNG, according to the Institute’s calculation.
•  Japanese players are focusing on resale of excess LNG abroad due to a saturated domestic
market. Increased nuclear and renewable energy generation has led to a decline in demand.
•  The Institute’s conclusion is that if Japanese utilities cannot resell excess LNG volumes, they will

need to renegotiate their supply contracts.

ANALYSIS

BY MAGDALENA OSUMI
AND YURIY HUMBER
Japan Looks to Reform Electricity Markets to Accommodate
Renewables. Again.


The electricity grid always needs balance. As Japan looks to shift its power systems
away from fossil fuels to renewable sources, achieving that balance has become an
increasingly complex exercise. And yet, after years of tinkering with market rules,
electricity trading, and policy to address this, the nation’s bureaucrats have decided to
pause and take stock.

In August 2023, METI launched a comprehensive review of all electricity market
reforms to date. This introspection aims to assess everything from how today’s various
electricity market platforms perform, to operating conditions for renewables, to ways
that the energy landscape will change with a planned multi-trillion-yen upgrade of the
grid. The latter is a step to delivering more green power to central cities / industry
from regions further afield.

The mother of all electricity sector reviews is chaired by renowned energy economist
Kanemoto Yoshitsugu and has an 8-person core panel filled with some of METI’s most
favored academics. It also carries 10 ‘observer’ members from the major utilities,
energy brokers, regulators and trading platforms. Representatives from OCCTO and
relevant ANRE departments complete the grouping, which has tentatively promised
to complete the review by fall of this year.


With such a scope and ambition, it would not be unusual to see the review process
spill over into a third year. However, according to Japan’s largest business lobby, the
Keidanren, there is little time to lose. The nation’s place as one of the leaders among
industrial nations is under threat should it fail to transfer its economy to a cleaner
footing by 2030. This invariably will require a reorientation of power markets and
systems to allow for a greater contribution from renewables, along with other carbon-
free power sources.

The review comes at a time when METI is also busy preparing the next iteration of the
Basic Energy Strategy. The result of the two processes may have a profound impact
on the nation’s energy map over the next decade.

Group background
In Japanese the review group is called 回同時市場の在り方等に関する検討会, which
translates into the rather unwieldy “Study Group on the State of the Simultaneous
Market”. The name refers to the need to have all the various electricity players,
platforms and structures work in sync. In other words: for the power markets to be in
balance.

The group acknowledges in its formation statement that its genesis owes to the fact
that the increased rollout of renewables – together with the unbundling of former
regional utilities, and a full liberalization of power retail and generation – have created

17



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

a complex set of conditions. As a result, electricity trading and generation assets are
not always managed in an efficient manner.

The inefficiency is non-trivial. It presents risks to the stability of the nation’s energy
system and complicates an expedient expansion of renewables in Japan.

"We discussed specific measures from the perspective of stable power supply and the
pursuit of merit order [to address] the uncertainty in supply-demand through a further
integration of renewable energy throughout Japan and its maximum possible rollout
while maintaining a supply-demand system and a market system,” the group said in
the formation statement.

The predecessor of this expert group was METI’s Working Group on Practical
Considerations for the Realization of an Ideal Wholesale Electricity Market, Supply and
Demand Balancing Market and Supply and Demand Operations. That group was
formed in mid-2022 and presented its findings to the ministry in April 2023.

The ideas presented by the earlier working group were carried into the new iteration
of the working group and are now looked at both more broadly and in more detail.
The new group is led by Visiting Professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy
Studies, Kanemoto Yoshitsugu. He’s better known as the first head of the
Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO),
which is the industry-backed entity that oversees the power system and liaisons with
the government / regulators.


Kanemoto had previously taught economic analysis of public policy at Tokyo
University’s Graduate School of Public Policy before joining OCCTO when it was
formed in 2015. In the ‘Simultaneous Markets’ study group, he is joined by:
•  Akimoto Keigo, senior researcher from Research Institute of Innovative
Technology for the Earth (RITE);
•  Isogawa Daiya, associate professor at Osaka Metropolitan University,
Graduate School of Economics;
•  Ichimura Takuto, attorney at Mori, Hamada and Matsumoto with expertise in
energy, infrastructure and financial services;
•  Watanabe Kenichi, assistant professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology,
Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering;
•  Komiyama Ryoichi, professor at the University of Tokyo, Graduate School of
Engineering, specializing in quantitative analysis of energy security;
•  Matsumura Toshihiro, professor at Tokyo University’s Institute of Social
Science, specializing in green transformation in oligopoly markets under
common ownership and common ownership in a delivered pricing duopoly;
•  Yokoyama Ahikiro. Tokyo University professor emeritus.

•  Yamamoto Ryutaro, Director of TDGC (Transmission & Distribution Grid

This group has met six times since August 2023, and its planning documents show
that the review process should be completed in “about a year”. The arrow that points
to 3Q 2024 on the timeline, however, is perforated, suggesting that the timing is
provisional and the process may be extended.


Point of focus
The liberalization of the power sector led to over 700 new entrants joining the industry
since 2016 to generate and / or retail electricity. That plethora of market players, and
the high number of individual generation units inherent in distributed power systems,
like solar and wind, have made the job of central coordinating parties like regulators
and grid operators very challenging.

The complexity is enhanced by the different characteristics of thermal and renewable
sources. A solar farm is quick to stop and start generation, but cannot easily guarantee
certain volumes over extended periods of time. Nuclear power plants provide steady
volumes over many months, but require weeks of planning to restart from cold.

In the eyes of METI and the energy experts involved in the current study group, to
make the electricity industry more efficient and stable, a market mechanism should be
formed that would allow “all electricity to be traded at the same time, regardless of
supply capacity and regulating capacity”. This is what the group calls a “Simultaneous
Market”.

In short, this is an attempt to combine the functions of various electricity trading
platforms so that, for example, spot and balancing trades are in sync.

In January 2023, Ichimura Takuto, a lawyer from Mori, Hamada and Matsumoto, who
is part of the ‘Simultaneous Markets’ study group, made a presentation at the Meet
Japan Power 2023, a forum organized by Japan NRG together with EEX and Volue. At
the time, Ichimura was seconded to the Electricity and Gas Industry Dept at METI’s
Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE).

Ichimura unveiled a METI-backed idea of creating a “Three-Part Offer,” a new
electricity market design that would act as an enhancement of today’s balancing
marketplace.

The design takes into consideration the three key factors that govern whether you can
secure electricity in the market: availability of capacity, availability of volume, and the
cost and time involved in getting this electricity to hand.

While Japan has various platforms that handle different types of power sales, such as
kW (Capacity Market), kWh (Spot, Intraday, Baseload, and Futures Markets) and ΔkW
(delta kilowatts, Balancing Market), the market platforms are not always able to work
smoothly, Ichimura explained. This is partly due to intricate relations that these
markets have with global fuel markets and financial markets, and partly because of the
ways in which the grid limits physical movement of electricity between Japan’s
regions.

To simplify or unify the various complexities, Ichimura argues that Japan could adopt
the Three-Part Offer approach, which would combine within one bid all the core
factors relevant to power production.

This market design in some ways mirrors the North American PJM and NYISO
mechanisms, but adjusts the conditions to fulfill METI’s objective of creating a system
that balances out the diverse and distributed aspects of a modern electricity industry.

Conclusion
According to Keidanren, the big-business lobby group, Japan needs to address four
core challenges this decade:
•  Significant reliance on fossil fuels that continues to draw criticism from the
international community;
•  Transmission constraints and other limitations hindering expansion of
renewables;
•  Delayed restart of nuclear power facilities, and

20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Relatively high electricity prices compared to other nations.

The comprehensive review process instigated by METI partly addresses these issues
but is also heavily preoccupied with the design of electricity market trading. That
assumes all generators will gravitate to market-based pricing, including the
renewables sector that until recently relied mostly on a state tariff system, the FIT.

While the FIT was phased out almost two years ago, it did not prompt a wholesale
shift to market-based electricity sales. In fact, both renewables developers and buyers
of green electricity are increasingly turning to the Corporate Power Purchase
Agreement (CPPA) business model. Effectively, this makes many renewables projects
client-led rather than market-price-driven. If that proliferates then the influence that
METI and its experts see renewables having on power markets may not materialize.

Once again, the bureaucrats are keen to create the perfect market design to fit the
increased role of renewables in Japan. And, once again, the renewables sector is
finding its own solution.

How Japanese Players Approach Pricing Strategy for New Climate Solutions
Japan’s efforts to combat the impact of climate change have spurred the
development of new, highly innovative products and services. But setting their market
price is proving to be a tricky and sensitive challenge given the near impossibility of
near-term commercial scale.


Climate business leaders say they are facing a number of vital questions: How many
years of R&D costs should the initial clients cover in the starting price? Or should the
price reflect the potential value customers hope to extract? Benchmarking against
related products is a tried and tested approach, but even if this is agreed on, talks
over the premium are far from simple.

In an uncertain world, the easiest option is to wait. And so dozens of talks related to
new energy developments are currently on hold, none more so than in the hydrogen
and ammonia offtakes space. Privately, those involved in the talks fear that many
projects will never make it outside the conference room.

Some businesses, however, are willing to take on risks and forge ahead. Japan NRG
has spoken with a number of representatives of firms across several sectors operating
in Japan to hear about how they managed to bridge buyer-seller differences and
agree on a value for innovation.

Pricing turnkey solutions
In the climate solutions space, there are currently more Business-to-Business (B2B)
than Business-to-Consumer (B2C) offerings. In part, this is natural for energy and
infrastructure, but it also reflects the way in which the energy transition is playing out:
New solutions are often created specifically to address known issues at partner or
client operations.

In this sense, the B2B deals are a reflection of long-term business relations, which
have developed over years and decades, and seek to extend into the net-zero era. In
such a situation, the solutions have come about from years of R&D, based on regular
talks and information exchanges. But the long-term nature of this process is being
undermined by ever-faster shifting industry trends.

Here are a few examples.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries is building a ship with four 40,000 m3 tanks to transport
liquid hydrogen, with construction to be completed about 2030. Up until around two
years ago, hydrogen was generally considered in Japan as a successor to LNG, and it
was thought that the production, transport and pricing of the fuel would mirror that of
its ‘predecessor.’


The thinking in industry and government discourse changed, however, and recently it
is ammonia as a fuel or a hydrogen carrier that is portrayed as the optimal solution for
Japan. The demand for specifically ammonia from JERA and other power utilities has
22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

raised its profile and business case far above that of liquid hydrogen, making some
say that the latter has few prospects.

But just as Kawasaki Heavy continues its multi-year development of vessels that carry
liquid H2 across the seas and oceans, so others in the supply chain say that they are
not willing to turn their backs on the technology. In fact, they believe liquid H2 will
make a comeback.

One official said his company’s strategic focus is very much on making hydrogen tanks
because they forecast that hydrogen will dominate the net zero future while interest in
ammonia and methanol will phase down. The official hopes that no innovation will
appear that would drastically upend his industry forecast, but there’s no guarantee
that won’t happen.

Another player betting big on hydrogen is Asahi Kasei. The chemical company had
worked with ammonia for decades, but in 2021 decided to invest heavily in green
hydrogen. Its first 10 MW electrolysis system was installed in Fukushima Pref. in 2022.

Since then, Asahi Kasei has looked for new electrolyzer clients while preparing to
double its output capacity to 2 GW a year from 2025. Officially, orders for electrolyzer
units are supposed to start in 2025, but with a year required for delivery of the 10 MW
system, sales talks cannot wait despite changing technological trends, policies and
price expectations.


Long delivery time does not always allow negotiation time for the potential buyer and
seller to agree on how to value the product. Buyers usually have emission cut goals
and deadlines. Sellers are under pressure to increase orders because they want to
scale up production. Both hope to lock in a deal before new trends emerge, or face
starting from scratch.

Buyers and sellers of turnkey infrastructure solutions – such as turbines to combust
hydrogen, LNG, and biogas – agree that an ‘environmental value’ (also known as a
green premium) needs to be reflected in the price. That value could, and should,
reflect the amount of fossil fuel cuts, emission cuts, water conservation, waste
reduction, nature conservation, improved noise and odor control, etc. But not all
buyers are willing to pay on such a basis.

As a compromise, some talks are moving their pricing to a benchmark that takes into
consideration the cost of equipment and then adds on a green premium.

Locking in a price is vital for manufacturers to prepare capacity, but often buyers are
mindful of accepting terms that are too stringent and long-term. After all, over the
coming decade, the price of carbon, the cost of water supply, and other feedstocks
will surely change. Some of these changes cannot easily be covered by a formula,
because they could include policy U-turns and market design revamps.

A “market price” holds little meaning in a shifting sands environment.

And so suppliers of new products are trying to get creative. One engineering firm
official said that his company has launched a project to develop open and transparent

23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

pricing platforms for clean energy commodities such as hydrogen. Another tech
startup says that it’s willing to accept fluid payment terms. Meaning, that in addition
to the old-fashioned bank transfers, it will consider payment in power or carbon
credits, or even hydrogen.

Less capital intensive B2B solutions
With less capital intensive B2B solutions, new products are now being packaged with
service offerings. Providers discovered that adoption was slow mainly due to the
difficulty that clients had in getting staff trained in new tools. As many firms in Japan
testify, labor shortages are a bottleneck and new tech is sometimes seen as a resource
drain.

“At the end of the day, if the total cost of introducing a new solution is more
expensive than the legacy way of doing things, customers won’t want it. But it
becomes a win-win deal if we send experts to customers to serve their needs,” said a
Nippon Koei official.

Nippon Koei has developed a biological soil crust (BSC), which consists of soil algae.
Derived from sugar cane, the algae traps and captures seeds, and consolidates them
on the surface. The process reduces the number of seeds blown away by wind, and
speeds up greening. BSC also converts barren land and desert into green land.

For the last ten years, Nippon Koei has been offering its soil algae to municipalities
that use it for soil erosion control and to maintain vegetation in parks. In expanding its
market scope to the private sector, the company decided to offer BSC as a service.
The chosen pricing strategy was to align with other greening services.


B2C pricing
In 2021, Tokyo-based Green Display Co. and Saitama-based Nisoul began marketing
botanical lighting systems that make use of electric currents flowing from plant roots
as a source of light. Their first targets were urban developers and the strategy was
successful. Innovative developers jumped on it, including Shibuya Hikarie, a popular
shopping mall near Shibuya Station.

Now, Green Display and Nisoul plan to widen their market to general consumers and
have developed a botanical power system that consists of electrodes to capture
electric currents from plants.

The electrodes are thrust into a flower pot with plants. Electrical wires connect the
electrodes to a power charging device, to charge pen lights. A kit consisting of an
electrode, a cable, a charging system, and a pen light was priced at ¥9,790. In
comparison, a portable solar kit with a small solar panel and a cable costs ¥890-
¥3,000 on Amazon.

“Our pricing approach was simple. We have a cost that we want to recover in a few
years, and then split it up by the target units to sell,” said an official at Green Display.
He added that the speed of mass market penetration was key to a successful
consumer business.

Conclusion
Innovations need to be monetized in order to survive. What Japan NRG’s anecdotal
review has found, however, is that while most firms pursue innovation in the B2B
sector, their pricing power is often weaker than those engaged in the B2C space.

Ultimately, judging winners and losers in the pricing game is a thankless task.
Innovations do not live within the constraint of an annual balance sheet. Their success
lies in opening markets and creating new demand. A ‘loss’ today could be a ‘win’ in
five years' time. Or, the precursor to an even bigger loss.

One commonality that does emerge, especially in the capital-intensive side of the B2B
space, is strong interest in linking prices to public commodity price indices. That has
moved forward many offtake discussions, but the bottleneck then becomes the size of
the premium and its tenure. (Sellers lean towards somewhere around 15 years, while
buyers prefer single-digit durations.)

The No. 1 question most have is what will be the price of CO2. That may be key to
the creation of a trusted ‘climate value’ index. But putting together such a product
and marketing it may take just as long as developing new climate technologies. It will
involve identifying the transaction norms, geographical flows, standardizing attributes,
crafting new rules, and a continuous dialog with the markets.

For those keen to move faster, there has to be a readiness to be both creative and
comfortable with market risk. It also requires the confidence to ride out the fast-
fashions and bumps of the energy transition.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

Australia / Renewable energy
Research by the Clean Energy Council determined that in 2023 renewable energy
comprised 39.4% of Australia’s total electricity, with 6 GW of clean energy projects
added to the country’s total generation capacity in 2023 alone.

Asia / Coal
Exports of seaborne coal from Russia to Asia have been weakening in recent months,
with lower shipments of both thermal grade and metallurgical coal used to make
steel. February exports were also some 21.6% below the 10.81 mln tons for February
2023.

India / BESS
Tata Power Solar Systems began operation on a 100 MW solar PV project coupled
with a 120 MW-hour utility-scale battery storage system (BESS), the largest in India.

India / Coal and solar power
The Ministry of Coal plans to boost renewable energy capacity, planning to install
over 9 GW by 2030 to support net-zero goals in the coal industry’s power
consumption. More precisely, rooftop and ground-mounted solar projects will be
promoted at mining facilities.

Indonesia / Solar power
A new regulation will encourage solar power, setting an annual target of 1 GW
rooftop solar connected to the PLN network and 500 MW from non-PLN sources. This
plan aims to utilize Indonesia’s silica sand resources to produce solar cells,
encouraging growth in the domestic solar module industry.

Philippines / Power
The country’s value-added output, and electricity power generation and distribution,
are forecasted to increase 7% YoY, with gas, renewables, and transmission
development as potential growth drivers.

SMRs
The small modular reactors (SMR) project pipeline reached 22 GW in Q1 2024,
increasing 65% since 2021; but it requires an investment of $176 billion. Of the five
leading countries in this pipeline, South Korea is the only Asian nation. The other four
are the U.S., Poland, Canada, and the UK.

South Korea / Offshore wind
Thai-based multinational B. Grimm Power will expand its renewable energy business
through investments in Nakwol Wind and Hanbit Wind, two offshore wind projects in
South Korea with a combined installed capacity of 740 MW.

Solar power
From 2022 to 2033, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is forecasted to
increase its solar capacity by 99 GW, reflecting an annual growth average of 21%
growth, according to BMI.

Vietnam / Energy transition
Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners inked a MoU with PetroVietnam, the Vietnamese
oil, gas, and renewable energy group. The companies plan to launch a collaboration
on renewable energy and offshore wind.
