NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Toyota to source its EV batteries from LG which will invest $3 bln in U.S. plant
(Company statement, Oct 5)
•  Toyota Motor inked a deal with South Korea's LG Energy Solution (LGES) to supply lithium-ion
batteries for EVs that Toyota will produce in North America from 2025.
•  LGES will invest about $3 billion in its plant in Michigan to build a new production line for Toyota.
Expected to be operational in 2025, annual production capacity will be 20 GWh, equal to about

280,000 units of Toyota's bZ4X model.
•  CONTEXT: In 2026, Toyota plans to increase global EV sales to 1.5 million units, rising to 3.5
million in 2030. Having sold only 24,000 in 2022, the company must increase its sales by more than
60 times by 2026. Stabilizing its battery procurement network is essential if EV production is to
proceed at a rapid pace.
• TAKEAWAY: Toyota has always been internationally minded on battery procurement. When it signed a
partnership with China's CATL in 2019, concerns were raised about national economic security issues.

However, Toyota said that it’s open to work with Chinese partners because it makes cars in China. Similarly,
the LG partnership is limited to supplying batteries to Toyota's North American plants, not for Toyota
operations in Japan.




Yamagata Pref’s Sakata coast given “promising offshore wind zone” status
(Government statement, Oct 3)
•  METI and MLIT named the Sakata Coast of Yamagata Pref as a promising zone to install large
offshore wind farms. “Promising zone” status is given to areas with offshore wind project potential.
In FY2024, JOGMEC will do studies of the area.
•  There are nine promising zones in total. Following further studies, the zones with proven potential

will be elevated into the next and final level – “promotion zones”.
•  The govt also said the coast along Yuza Town in Yamagata Pref and the Sea of Japan Coast of
Aomori Pref (also known as the southern coast) gained “promotion zone” status, following public
consultation of the govt proposal. The govt will hold auctions to choose operators of projects in
the promotion zones.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Two areas in Hokkaido tapped as “preparatory zone” for floating offshore wind sites

(Government statement, Oct 3)
o  Hokkaido’s Ganwu-Minami Siribesi Coast and Shimamaki Coast were tapped as sites with
potential for floating offshore wind projects, said METI and MLIT. The two areas now
have “preparatory zone” status, a level below “promising zones”.
o  Earlier, the two received “promising zone” status for fixed-foundation installations. The
floating facilities will be further out at sea, without overlapping.

o  ANRE plans to write standards for choosing hydrogen/ ammonia projects to be financed

by GX transition bonds by year’s end. It also plans a regulatory approach to increase
hydrogen/ ammonia consumption in addition to subsidizing their sale.
o  Other ideas include mandating govt-funded projects to realize low carbon footprints.



India, Japan launch $600 mln fund for low carbon emission projects

(Company statement, Oct 4)
•  India's National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation (JBIC) launched a $600 million fund to invest in renewable energy, EVs, and waste
management in India.
•  JBIC will contribute 51% of that figure, and India the rest.
•  CONTEXT: Japan and India are members of the Quad partnership; the two others are Australia
and the U.S. The four are committed to supporting an open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific

that is inclusive and resilient. The Quad is important for Japan and the U.S. because India is seen
as having a pivotal role in shaping the basic direction of global politics through its geography,
demographics, economic potential, and IT skills.

Carbon EX launches carbon credit and emission rights exchange service
(Company statement, Oct 4)
•  At the end of September, Carbon EX, a JV between Asuene and SBI HD, launched a carbon credit
and emission rights exchange service. It’s the first major Japanese financial institution to start such

a trading hub.
•  The platform serves as a starting point for the creation of carbon credit-related businesses, and
enables domestic and foreign project developers and buyers to trade CO2-related contracts.
•  A total of 35 types of credits and non-fossil certificates can be handled via the platform, which has
more than 300 companies pre-registered with over 1.3 million tons of CO2 equivalent in credits.
•  CONTEXT: Carbon EX has also signed an MoU with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group for carbon
credit and environmental value transactions, and has an agreement with SBI Shinsei Bank for

carbon credit related business.



Business group proposes Scope 3 data sharing standards
(Japan NRG, Oct 2)
•  The Green X Digital Consortium compiled data sharing standards for measuring Scope 3 emissions

throughout supply chains, it told CEATEC 2023.
•  The consortium comprises 139 multinational companies. The standards are compatible with those
of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
•  To cover the full supply chain, it’s proposed to use secondary data from third party sources to
measure emissions when primary data is lacking, labeling them as such.
•  To protect business secrets, companies would share final emissions data but not details such as the
raw materials used, the treatment processes and the breakdown of emission origins.
•  CONTEXT: The consortium standards are not legally binding, but METI, MLIT, MAFF and other

ministries participated as observers during the writing of the standards.



Top shipping companies join forces to sail large liquid H2 carrier in 2024
(Japan NRG, Oct 6)
•  JSE Ocean plans to sail the world's first liquefied hydrogen-fueled carrier by 2024. The company is

a JV of three top shipping companies and Japan Suiso Energy (JSE), which sailed the world’s first
liquefied H2 carrier in 2022.
•  Nippon Yusen, Kawasaki Kisen, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) became JSE Ocean’s shareholders
on Sept 22. JSE owns 50.2%; the three others have 16.6% each.
•  The JV focuses on safe transport of hydrogen (preventing leakage, minimizing tank corrosion), and
developing a framework for vessel ownership and operation.
•  CONTEXT: The vessel for the 2024 voyage will be built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which made

the first liquefied H2 carrier, Suiso Frontier, which can hold 75 tons of liquefied H2.
• TAKEAWAY: Liquefied H2’s main advantage is its purity. After converting the liquid back to gas, it can be
directly used for applications that require high purity hydrogen, such as fuel cells. The challenges are the costs
of liquefaction, gasification, building new ships and infrastructures, and scaling up transport capacity from 75
to several tens of thousands of tons.

TEPCO begins second release of Fukushima treated water into the ocean
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 2)
•  On Oct 5, TEPCO began the second release of treated water from the Advanced Liquid Processing
System (ALPS) at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP.
•  The first release took place from Aug 24 to Sept 11, during which the facility operated steadily,

and no abnormal tritium levels were detected.
•  Monitoring of the ocean near the discharge point is now conducted daily, instead of weekly.
•  CONTEXT: TEPCO plans to release about 460 tons of treated water per day, for the next three
weeks, at a distance of 1 km off the coast via an underwater tunnel. Over the next 30 years, TEPCO
aims to dispose of 1.34 million tons of water or about 98% of storage capacity, pooled in over
1,000 tanks at the power plant.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

In the wake of China’s ban, TEPCO will hear compensation claims from fishing industry
(Asahi Shimbun, Oct 3)
o  TEPCO is accepting compensation claims for reputational damage suffered by fishermen
due to the discharge of treated water from the Fukushima NPP.
o  The amount of compensation will be done on an individual basis, with 2022 as the
baseline year, recognizing the drop in price, post-discharge, as the loss in question.
o  According to August trade statistics, since China’s ban took effect, seafood exports to

China decreased 75.7% YoY, and the situation is expected to worsen. A survey by the
Fisheries Agency revealed a price drop of 11-27% in scallop exports from four
prefectures, including Hokkaido.
o  CONTEXT: If China’s ban continues, total compensation might rise significantly. Initially,
TEPCO anticipated a sales drop in seafood from areas near the nuclear plant due to the
water discharge, but China’s total ban was not expected.

•  Market participants suggest that the decline in off-hours trading contributed to the overall stability

of the market.
•  In August, spot prices reached as high as ¥25/ kWh, and there were no significant spikes. Some
market participants view more stable markets as reducing the need for hedging through futures
contracts.



Japan opens electricity data from smart meters to corporate use

(Nikkei, Oct 2)
•  Japan has dropped restrictions on corporate use of electricity data. This will allow companies to
tap the information to launch various services.
•  With roughly 20 corporate groups including Daiwa House Industry and Toshiba poised to
introduce services, Japan hopes the move will lead to solutions for various issues related to
decarbonization and a graying population.
•  CONTEXT: Electricity usage data is collected from smart meters that log power consumption.

Japan has 80 million smart meters, more than the U.S. or European countries. Until now, only
utilities had access to this data, but a legal revision allows other companies to use it for a fee.
•  Some companies are considering services that aid the global shift away from GHG emissions.
Daiwa House Asset Management plans to calculate CO2 emissions based on electricity use by
residents of about 240 properties owned by the group. It hopes that environmentally friendly
services, like helping residents conserve energy based on this data, boost profits for the group's

real estate business.

Tokyo’s Narita Airport aims for 180 MW in solar capacity by 2045

(Japan NRG, Oct 2)
•  Tokyo International Airport, (Narita Airport), began building a 2 MW solar power station on a cargo
terminal rooftop, the first among its projects to install 180 MW in solar capacity by 2045.
•  Narita aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, and already has rooftop and ground solar with a total
capacity of 2.2 MW.
•  CONTEXT: Govt guidelines on renewables capacity at airports were updated in December 2022,
clarifying conditions for installations along runways, where solar panels are discouraged since

reflections can distract pilots and traffic controllers. The govt is urging airports to add storage
batteries, hydrogen and wind systems.
• TAKEAWAY: As airport energy systems fall outside the scope of the Aviation Act and the Radio Act, airport
authorities won’t require regulatory approvals to install renewables. The govt wants airports to take advantage
of this and deploy solar panels and small wind turbines, as long as they do not obstruct flights or radio
communications.

JERA decommissions 2.6 GW of capacity at Hirono Thermal Power Station
(Asahi Shimbun, Oct 5)
•  JERA announced full closure of Units 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 2.6 GW) at the Hirono Thermal Power
Station. Unit 1 ceased operations in April 2016; Units 3 and 4 ceased operations in July 2018. The

remaining Units 2, 5, and 6 will continue to operate.
•  The Hirono Thermal Power Station has used crude oil and heating oil for Units 1 to 4, and coal for
Units 5 and 6. The oldest, Unit 1, began operations in April 1980.
•  Also, JERA is upgrading its Goi Thermal Power Station in Chiba Pref (Units 1 to 3) and Unit 2 of
Yokosuka Thermal Power Station in Kanagawa Pref, (3 GW total).



TEPCO EP resumes high voltage and extra-high voltage electricity service offering
(Denki Shimbun Oct 2)
•  TEPCO Energy Partner resumed its standard menu for electricity tariffs targeting special high
voltage and extra-high voltage customers.
•  CONTEXT: New market entrants (known as shin denryoku) had been striving to reacquire high
voltage and extra-high voltage customers while TEPCO EP suspended its standard service offering.

But rising prices last year forced many of the new entrants into hard times as their business model
was based on a trend for lower electricity prices. The wholesale JEPX market’s average (spot) price
per kWh was ¥11.21 in FY2020, ¥13.46 in FY2021, and ¥20.41 in FY2022.
• TAKEAWAY: Understanding of market risk has increased in recent years among both power retailers and
clients in Japan, leading to a more mature market. However, the retreat from the market by many new
providers in the last 8-10 months is reducing the level of competition and again creating a dominant scenario
for EPCOs. Also, a more stable price period lulls many buyers into a false sense of security, and reduces their

appetite to spend on risk hedging. This will surely vex many METI officials that wish to see more competition in
the electricity retail sector, though how they address it without affecting energy security issues is unclear.



Suttsu council election seen as positive step for nuclear waste disposal site study
(NHK, Oct 3)
•  In Suttsu, Hokkaido, a majority of council seats were won by candidates who support allowing the
town to advance to the next phase of review of its suitability as the site for a national nuclear waste
disposal facility.
•  This election could impact the town's decisions in advancing to the "preliminary survey" phase,
which is post the current "literature survey" stage.

•  Regulations require nuclear waste to be disposed of 300 meters underground. The town plans a
public referendum before moving to the next phase.
•  CONTEXT: Surveys are made by Japan's Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NUMO). The
current phase to select a nuclear waste disposal site, the "literature survey," entails evaluating site
suitability without conducting on-site research. The next phase would verify whether the region
meets facility conditions stipulated by law.
• TAKEAWAY: This is positive news for NUMO, especially after the Mayor of Tsushima City (Nagasaki Pref)

declined to accept a "literature survey" last week despite the city council's earlier approval. Since the search
for a nuclear waste disposal site began in 2002, these surveys have only taken place in two localities in
Hokkaido, in Suttsu and Kamoenai. As the surveys take years to conduct, they can easily be canceled if

elections bring new leaders to power. For example, in 2007 the mayor of Toyo nominated his town to host the
disposal site; three months later, however, he lost the election and the new mayor withdrew the town’s
candidacy.



KEPCO and ANRE to discuss intermediate storage of used nuclear fuel
(Nikkei, Oct 5)
•  On Oct 10, KEPCO vice-president Mizuta Hitoshi and ANRE officials will visit Fukui Pref to discuss
the intermediate storage of used nuclear fuel. KEPCO has promised Fukui Governor to identify

candidate storage sites outside the prefecture.
•  This follows a June announcement about sending 200 tons of used nuclear fuel to France for
research, scheduled in the late 2020s; this move was supported by the government but met with
demands for re-explanation in Fukui.
•  The inability to confirm candidate sites could lead to the halting of operations at three of KEPCO’s
nuclear facilities.

Resources Minister: Australia will “always be” reliable supplier of gas to Japan
(Australian Financial Review, Oct 6)
•  Amid LNG supply concerns on the road to net zero in 2050, Resources Minister Madeleine King
says Australia will “always be” a reliable exporter of gas to Japan.
•  After former Tokyo Gas chairman Michiaki Hirose warned on Oct 6 that any disruption to LNG
supplies would have a “huge impact”, Ms King moved to reassure Japan.
•  CONTEXT: Australia is among the world's top LNG exporters, with its highest exports ever, in

2022, reaching 81.5 mmt. Over the past 30 years, Japan’s investment has been crucial in the
development of Australia’s gas export industry; and today Japan gets over 35% of its natural gas
from Australia. Meanwhile, Australia has legislated GHG reduction targets for the gas industry and
said it aims to reach net zero by 2050.
• TAKEAWAY: In recent years, Australia has made regulatory interventions in gas projects and there has been a
logjam of project approvals. This has hurt the confidence of Asian investors in the country, which see Australian

supply as vital for their energy security.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Labor government’s natural gas policy raises supply fears in Japan

(Australian Financial Review, Oct 6)
o  As the Kishida administration prepares for high-level talks with Australian PM Albanese
on energy security and investment, Michiaki Hirose, who was Tokyo Gas chairman until
he retired in June, said that disruptions to Australian LNG supply would have a “huge
impact” on millions of people in both countries.
o  Tokyo Gas has 12 million users, mainly in the Tokyo area, and the energy needs of more
than half are supplied by LNG from Australia, said Hirose.

CONTEXT: Japanese gas buyers are anxious that Australia is “quietly quitting” LNG.
Japanese officials said that a discussion paper released this week by Resources Minister
Madeleine King ignored the role of Australian gas in beefing up energy security for Asian
allies.
• TAKEAWAY: Hirose’s comments reflect anxiety in Japan about the stability of Australian gas supply and come
just days after producers warned that PM Albanese’s decarbonization policy ignores increasing demand for

LNG from Asian trading partners, such as Japan.



Toshiba may partner with Furuya Metal on iridium supply with an eye on green hydrogen

(Company statement, Oct 6)
•  Toshiba is looking to form a partnership to establish a supply network for iridium. Its subsidiary,
Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions, signed an MoU with Furuya Metal, a Mitsubishi group metal
supplier focused on platinum group metals.


16


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Toshiba aims to build equipment for green hydrogen production using renewable energy, with
iridium as a vital catalyst in the electrolyzers' membranes that extract hydrogen from water.
•  CONTEXT: Global production of iridium is limited to around seven tons annually; prices are rising
due to increasing demand as hydrogen energy gains in popularity. Toshiba is also working on a
membrane that needs less iridium, which would reduce hydrogen production costs.

• TAKEAWAY: Furuya Metal is a top global trader in iridium, rhodium, and ruthenium, which are used in clean
energy technologies. Rhodium was the most expensive metal until last year, when surpassed by iridium.
Substitution and price plunge usually follow a price hike, so working with Toshiba may be Furuya's strategy to
retain customers after a possible price crash. However, this new alliance could lead to further price moves
since iridium is a small market, and the companies need to operate carefully so that price equilibrium is
maintained.




Lundin Mining in talks with Japanese trading houses to develop Argentina copper mine

(Reuters, Oct 5)
•  Canadian-Swedish Lundin Mining is in talks with Japanese trading houses for a stake of as much as
50% in Argentina's Josemaria mine, said new CEO Jack Lundin.
•  A risk analysis is underway to finalize the choice of partners to help develop the copper and gold
mine. A final decision is expected next year. The project will require about $3 billion to develop.
• TAKEAWAY: Copper is a major component in EVs – used in electric motors, batteries, inverters, wiring and in
charging stations. Amid a global economic slowdown, there’s been a downward trend in copper prices since
late January when the metal traded at $4.29/ pound. The metal now trades at about $3.60/ pound, and if

prices continue to fall below that mark then mining companies could be forced to cut copper production.



LNG stocks rise 3.8% to 1.62 million tons

(Government data, Oct 4)
•  LNG stocks of 10 power utilities stood at 1.62 million tons as of Oct 1, up 3.8% from 1.56 million
tons a week earlier.
•  The end-October stocks last year were 2.53 million tons. The five-year average for this time of year
was 2.01 million tons.

ANALYSIS

BY KYOKO FUKUDA

Japan Looks Far Offshore with Floating Wind Technology
As the pace of adding new solar farms slows and onshore wind farms face greater
scrutiny from local officials, offshore wind may prove the best route to expand Japan’s
renewables capacity in the coming decades. The challenge, however, is deciding and
then developing the type of wind turbines that are most optimal for Japan’s coastal
waters.

There are two types of offshore wind turbine platforms – fixed bottom and floating.
Fixed-bottom are best for waters that are less than 80 meters deep, while floating
platforms can perform well in waters that are 100 meters and deeper.

Plans to develop fixed-bottom wind farms in Japan are well underway, but experts
and companies are looking at the next step — floating offshore wind technology,
because of its many advantages. As the R&D is still in an experimental stage, it’s
difficult to predict which turbine and floating platform will win out, but several projects
are emerging as front-runners.

For those companies that develop the most efficient turbine for Japan, the prize is
what some experts say could be the world’s largest floating offshore wind market.
With surveyed potential estimated at 424 GW, according to the Japan Wind Power
Association, floating wind technology offers triple the opportunity in terms of capacity
than fixed-bottom units.


Background
In the past decade, total global offshore wind power installation has increased rapidly.
According to the Global Wind Energy Council, over 380 GW of offshore wind will be
added in the next ten years in about 30 countries, bringing total capacity to 444 GW,
up from the current 64 GW. Asia Pacific will account for about half of the total new
capacity.

In 2022, Japan added a paltry 84 MW of fixed-bottom offshore wind to reach a total
capacity of 228 MW, according to the Japan Wind Power Association. This is almost
nothing for a nation with 18,000 kilometers of coastline along its four major islands.
This figure is a tiny fraction of China’s 30 GW in fixed-bottom offshore wind capacity.

Another island nation, the UK, is making a bid to be the global leader in floating
offshore wind, aiming to build 34 GW of capacity by 2040, according to that country’s
Floating Offshore Wind Taskforce. Meanwhile, in the Asia Pacific region, in the next
decade, floating offshore wind will account for 1.5 GW, or 6% of the total 26 GW of
new offshore capacity that’s expected in the region, (excluding China), according to
Wood Mackenzie.

Floating offshore wind enjoys several key advantages over fixed-bottom: the wind
blows harder and more regularly far from shore. This means more energy can be
produced. Since they bob with the waves, floating platforms are less impacted by
storms and high waves, as well as earthquakes and tsunamis. Also, there’s less conflict
with stakeholders. Recently, more countries are seeing local pushback against wind

farms close to shore. The industry will have to move further out, which essentially
means switching to floating turbines. The seas surrounding Japan become quite deep
a short distance offshore.

Also, the position of the wind power generator near the water's surface means easier
access for repairs, lowering maintenance costs. Floating axis turbines can be brought
to a wind farm already built and ready to float, eliminating crane work and reducing
construction time.

However, floating offshore wind technology faces a number of challenges. State
financing is still vital, especially in the current experimental stage. And, Japan yet has
to set up a legal framework for floating offshore wind, opening acreage in its exclusive
economic zone (EEZ), which covers 4.5 million square kilometers.

Japan was an early pioneer in floating offshore wind power, when in October 2013 it
launched the turbine, “Fukushima Mirai” about 20 km off the coast of the town of
Naraha (Fukushima Pref). About seven years later, the pilot project was shuttered due
to poor performance.

Not many people want to remember that failure, and it highlights the uncertainty
around the future of floating offshore wind as an energy source. But the government
is determined to return to this sector and is taking the lead. That task has fallen to
NEDO, the national research hub, to stimulate innovation in the sector.


Which technology is best for Japan?
Last month, METI’s subcommittee on renewable energy and next-generation
electricity networks singled out floating offshore wind power and perovskite solar cells
as top areas for innovation in renewables, and called for a suitable industrial strategy
and targets to expand into the waters of the EEZ.

METI’s Green Innovation Fund will contribute by helping with the development of new
floating offshore wind technologies, technical standards, selection of ocean/sea areas
and operators for large-scale demos. JOGMEC will survey wind conditions and
geological features to help determine the optimal sites; this information will be
accessible to companies.

By leveraging Japan's shipbuilding skills and infrastructure, NEDO envisages creating
tech that can optimize floating bases and mooring systems. Low-cost construction
technologies will also be developed to create the world's first mass production system
for floating turbines.

Floating wind platforms come in three types – Spar; Tension-leg Platform (TLP); and
Semi-submersible. Japan is trialing all three.

Spar is a floating structure connected to a heavyweight spar and anchored to the
seabed by a cable-based mooring system. Using tethers, TLPs offer stability of floating
systems with minimal mooring footprint. However, the spread mooring used for semi-
submersible platforms is more suitable for mooring sites where the seabed geology is
not suited for driving in TLP foundation piles. Both TLP and semi-submersible have
the same basic floating structure of three columns connected by upper and lower box
girders and a wind turbine installed on top of one column.

Leading projects
In August 2018, NEDO announced plans to develop innovative floating offshore wind
turbines, and to provide financial support. The goal is to develop commercially viable
“ocean energy power generation technology by 2030”, said NEDO, using its own
specific term for floating offshore wind.
BARGE
Engineering giant Hitachi Zosen Corp has been involved in this space since 2015. In
May 2019, together with partners Marubeni and Kyuden Mirai Energy, Hitachi Zosen
launched “Hibiki”, a barge-type floating wind turbine about 15 km off the coast of
Kitakyushu where the water depth is between 50-100 meters.
The module features BW Ideol’s “damping pool” floating foundation and a 3.2 MW
two-bladed turbine made by Aerodyn Engineering. BW Ideol is a French company,
while Aerodyn is German. The goal is to achieve low-cost power generation of ¥20/
kWh by 2030, as well as to find ways for efficient maintenance.
SEMI-SUB
In October 2022, Japan Marine United (JMU), Japan Shipyard, K-Line Wind Service,
and Toa Construction also began to test a semi-submersible platform 3 km off the
coast of Akita Prefecture. The goal is to test the platform’s durability and the
possibility of cutting costs with this approach.

JMU is designing and testing a semi-submersible type of floating platform suitable for
12 MW wind turbines. The project involves testing hybrid anchoring by combining
steel chain and synthetic nylon rope, and verifying if it can endure cold winters and
strong winds such as typhoons.

TLP
In August 2022, MODEC, JERA, Toyo Construction, and Furukawa Electric began
testing the TLP type of floating offshore wind turbine in Hokkaido. This goal is to
research its impact on the sea bottom. If successful, TLP could become the main
solution for the floating offshore wind, with its relatively low cost of power generation
and minimal impact on fisheries and ships. Phase 1 of the experiment will last until late
March 2024, while phase 2 would extend until early 2031.

FLOATING AXIS
Finally, this past June, a consortium led by electric utility J-Power began testing a 20-
kW floating axis wind turbine that aims to cut installation costs by half. If all goes well,
a 5 MW pilot will start field tests in 2026. The goal is to commercially launch a 15 MW
model by 2032. J-Power’s 20 kW turbines use 10-meter blades, while the 5 MW
turbines will use 110-meter blades.

Other partners in this project include Tokyo-based wind power startup Albatross
Technology, Chubu Electric, Osaka University, TEPCO, and shipping company
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha. Unlike conventional windmill-type turbines, the floating axis
model works like a spinning vertical cylinder propelled by three outer blades that
catch the wind. It will be anchored to the ocean floor by a chain.

Recent setback
Japan’s offshore floating wind ambitions recently faced a blow when defects were
found in the platforms for the Goto Floating Wind Farm, which is the country’s first
major floating wind project – 16.8 MW (eight turbines, each 2.1 MW). The Goto farm
is being developed by an all-Japanese group led by Toda Corp and involves Osaka
Gas, INPEX, Kansai Electric and Chubu Electric among others.

Located off the coast of Goto city, (Nagasaki Pref), the wind farm plans to utilize
Hitachi’s hybrid spar and TLP platforms. Construction began last year, but while
operations were to start in January 2024, the project now faces a two-year delay that’s
due to glitches in two floating structure units assembled onshore. One of the three
units installed offshore was brought onshore for checks. Two other units might also be
brought back onshore.

Conclusion
At the moment, floating wind’s technologies are in their infancy, but by the end of the
decade it has the potential to play an increasingly important role in Japan’s effort to
decarbonize its power generation sector.

Some other major issues, however, that so far are getting scant attention are the vast
amounts of material and investment needed to build the transmission lines that will
extend from far out at sea to onshore substations; not to mention the port
infrastructure to build and service these floating wind farms.

These are all an entire set of other challenges that have yet to be fully addressed. For
now, the public and private sector in Japan will hope they will have a reason to take
on those other challenges once a commercially successful floating turbine is delivered
within this decade.

Geopolitical Tensions Cloud Japan-China Energy Cooperation

Since 1945, Chinese-Japanese relations in the energy sector have evolved
significantly, influenced by changing economic priorities, diplomatic goals, and global
energy dynamics. Today, due to geopolitical shifts caused by the 18-month war in
Ukraine and Japan’s push to strengthen economic security by deepening relations
with G7 allies, further development of Japan-China energy ties will be limited.

Despite obvious advantages in potential cooperation, as well as geographical
proximity, the two countries have been cautious about collaborating in energy. Often
eyeing each other as rivals for upstream energy projects around the globe, the two
countries have only really connected in LNG and, more recently, in the hydrogen
sector.

Nevertheless, amid this frosty geopolitical context, some Japanese companies are
trying to find room to maneuver and establish cooperation with Chinese partners.
Here’s a brief overview and survey of current energy relations between China and
Japan, with a sober analysis of how feasible growth and development might possibly
play out.


A brief history
Since World War II, Chinese-Japanese energy relations have evolved through several
phases. Initially in the post-War era, Japan was trying to cope with energy shortages,
and turned to China for coal supplies. But that changed when the Communists came
to power in 1949 and the new regime severely curtailed relations with liberal
democracies that it viewed as hostile.

Diplomatic normalization in 1972 between China and western countries marked an era
of increased economic cooperation. For its part, Japan explored investment
opportunities in China's energy sector, notably importing Chinese coal during the
1970s and 1980s. These cheap resources proved crucial in fueling Japan's rapid
growth in the 1980s. At the time, China’s economic miracle was barely at the starter
stage.

As China’s economy and manufacturing rapidly developed in the 2000s, it started to
take over the top global positions that Japanese firms had initially held in solar panels,
batteries, and other energy sectors. With China’s growing competitive strength, its
politics towards Japan also became more demanding with historical issues mixed in
with tensions about raw material supply chains. In 2010, China limited the export of
rare earth metals to Japan after a territorial dispute gained prominent attention.

Despite the ominous political picture, energy and trade between the two countries
remained active in the last decade. The vast majority of solar panels that Japan has
installed in the last 11 years, in which time it built the world’s third-largest solar
capacity, have come from China.

LNG
While Japan last year was the world’s largest buyer of LNG, China was close behind in
second. The latter is poised to overtake Japan in the next few years as it signs more
long-term deals with Middle Eastern and U.S. suppliers. (China temporarily held the
top global spot for LNG imports in 2021).

Still, while the two countries compete for new LNG projects, investments and
procurements, they have also had a moderate level of success in collaborations. In
July 2020, Diamond Gas International (DGI), a subsidy of Mitsubishi Corp, signed a
four-year LNG purchase agreement with Guangdong Energy Group (GEG) for 2020-
2023. This marked GEG’s first LNG term contract with a foreign company and DGI’s
first LNG term contract with China. GEG imports LNG at its 6%-owned Guangdong
Dapeng receiving terminal.

With an eye to expand its LNG business, JERA, Japan’s largest utility, established its
Beijing office in 2022. As early as 2018, the firm, alongside TEPCO Fuel and Power,
signed an agreement with China Huadian Green Energy to promote cooperation in
energy infrastructure projects related to power generation and LNG in third countries.
Also, JERA holds a 5% stake in the construction of the Ganyu LNG terminal in
Jiangsu.

LNG firms from China and Japan have also found joint opportunities in third countries.
Mitsui and JOGMEC have a joint 10% stake in Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project, while
China’s CNOOC and CNPC also hold a 10% stake. The two Japanese entities have
maintained their stakes in the project even after Japan condemned Russia. Prime
Minister Kishida’s government endorses this policy because the withdrawal would
damage the nation’s energy security and likely allow China to increase its stake on
favorable terms.

Meanwhile, in 2019, Japan's Saibu Gas and Russia’s Novatek agreed to jointly sell
LNG in Asia. At the end of 2020, the two companies jointly transported LNG in small
lots to Shanghai after filling the liquid at the Hibiki LNG terminal located on the Sea of
Japan, marking their first joint export.

Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the two firms had planned to expand the project
by FY2024 and increase annual supply to China by up to 140,000 tons. Now, however,
talks between the two companies are suspended. In October 2022, Saibu Gas
confirmed that negotiations won’t resume.


Wind and Solar
After helping to drive Japan’s 72-GW-solar rollout since 2010, Chinese firms thought
there would also be opportunities in wind power generation, especially after all major
Japanese turbine makers withdrew from the sector.

Geopolitical tensions are interfering with those plans. Mingyang Smart Energy, one of
China's leading wind and solar power companies, recently entered the Japanese
market. The company has delivered three 3-MW wind turbines to the town of Nyuzen
(Toyama Prefecture), and sees itself as catering to the clients that need such smaller
turbines rather than the big units where Siemens, GE and Vestas are dominant.

Mingyang is no minnow. It is the sixth largest wind turbine maker globally. It has also
vowed to take measures at the Nyuzen project and any future projects to ensure that
crucial data such as ocean currents, which are essential for national defense, won’t be
misused.

But with data sharing and coastal water security under greater scrutiny, Mingyang will
find it tough to score more deals. Japanese manufacturers, which previously may have
entered into a JV to localize production, are also weary of partnership with Chinese
firms. Meanwhile, the bigger wind farms are planned further out at sea and this only
deepens the issue of security.


Power
Japan and China have long cooperated in energy conservation. At their summit in
2022, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Kishida agreed to boost cooperation in
the green economy, including energy conservation.

In February, 17 MoUs were signed for projects in the public, private, and academic
spheres at the Japan-China Comprehensive Forum on Energy Conservation and
Environment. Trade Minister Nishimura Yasutoshi expressed his hope that the forum
would serve as an opportunity to accelerate the energy transition in the two
countries.

Shanghai Electric, the world’s largest maker of steam turbines, is also expanding into
Japan via its subsidiary, Shanghai Electric Japan, which is now a member of the
Keidanren. Several of its subsidiaries and affiliates have joined renewable power
generation projects in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Tsukuba City, Ibaraki
Prefecture, and Osaka City, etc. However, some Japanese politicians are wary of those
projects from a security perspective and take their concerns to sympathetic media.


EVs and FCVs
Toyota's sales in China fell 4.9% YoY in the January-July period this year. In response,
Toyota terminated the contracts of 1,000 term workers at its joint venture with
Guangzhou Automobile Group. However, the Japanese auto giant is redoubling
efforts at its Changshu-based R&D center, hoping to improve its position in the
Chinese market.

Toyota has also redirected its sales focus for hydrogen fuel cell cars from the North
American market to China and Europe. This fits with the more aligned views in China
and Japan on the development of hydrogen-fueled transport.

The EV and FCV arena is, however, a space in which Chinese and Japanese firms are
likely to be rivals rather than allies. Chinese battery manufacturers lead the world in
the current lithium-ion technology and are forging ahead in new chemistries based on
sodium and zinc. But Japanese auto and battery makers hope to get back in front with
the development of a next-gen all-solid-state battery.


The best of frenemies
The manufacturing strength of both countries and their similar outlook for energy
transition pathways suggests that there could be a number of energy collaboration

opportunities. The vector of political relations will dictate whether some or none of
these are utilized.

For Chinese firms in sectors from hydrogen to batteries to nuclear, there is merit in
finding partners in Japan, not only for local sales but also to jointly explore
opportunities in other Asian markets. For Japanese companies, there is a nagging
concern that a Chinese partner today could tomorrow mirror their technology and
strike out on its own.

The only thing that could bridge the gaps and build trust is a common cause. Climate
change was considered to be just that. In the current geopolitical climate, however, it
.
does not seem to be enough

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Asia Pacific/ Energy transition
The region will invest $3.3 trillion on power generation over the next decade. Nearly
50% will go towards wind and solar, while storage and nuclear will receive 12% and
11%, respectively. Led by China, the region accounts for over half of global electricity
demand.

Bulgaria/ Energy protests
Protesters blocked roads for several days to protest govt plans to shut down coal-
burning power plants as part of the energy transition. Bulgarian miners and other
energy-sector workers took to the streets.

Canada/ Renewables
In a $1 billion deal, investment firm Brookfield will acquire UK-based Banks
Renewables, which owns operational onshore wind farms in northern England and
Scotland, as well as a large portfolio of onshore wind, solar and battery assets that are
in development.

China/ Grid investment
Investments in Chiba’s power sector may exceed 100 trillion yuan ($13.7 trillion) from
2020 to 2060. The timeframe is in line with President Xi Jinping's pledge for China to
attain net-zero emissions by 2060.
EU/ Carbon tax
On Oct 8, the EU launched its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Foreign-based,
carbon-intensive industries will have to report their emissions if they want to enter the
EU market. Russia and China said this violates free trade.

Germany/ Coal power
Coal-fired power plants will again be utilized this winter, from October until late
March, to replace natural gas and avoid power shortages. By next summer, the govt
will propose how to offset increased CO2 from these plants.

Oil Markets
Russia and Saudi Arabia will continue voluntary production cuts to the end of this year
amid tightening supply and rising demand. Their pledge came hours before a
ministerial panel of OPEC+ convened.

Saudi Arabia/ Natural gas
Aramco will acquire a $500 million stake in MidOcean energy, as it aims to expand
gas production by at least 50% until 2030 compared to 2021 levels. Its Jafurah field
starts production in 2025. Aramco believes the LNG market is positioned for long-
term growth.

The environment ministry approved plans by TotalEnergies to drill offshore for gas
and oil, rejecting appeals from lobby groups challenging the decision. TotalEnergies
discovered two massive gas fields off South Africa in 2019 and 2020.

UAE/ Natural gas
ADNOC awarded two contracts worth a combined $17 billion for its Hail & Ghasha
field, its largest gas project ever. Ghasha is set to produce more than 1.5 bcfd of gas
by 2030. The Emirati company confirmed it had taken a final investment decision on
the project.

UK/ CCS
British oil services firm Petrofac won a $600 million contract from ADNOC Gas for the
Habshan carbon capture and storage project in the UAE. The deal involves delivery of
carbon capture units, pipeline infrastructure and a network of wells for CO2 recovery
and injection.

Uranium prices
Uranium prices have climbed roughly 50% so far this year to a 12-year high, now
trading at about $72/ pound as markets see rising demand. The World Nuclear
Association forecasts nuclear capacity growing nearly 80% and demand for uranium
roughly doubling by 2040.
