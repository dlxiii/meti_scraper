NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


PM Ishiba meets Trump at the White House to discuss LNG, trade, investment

(Japan NRG, Feb 8)
•  In a meeting with PM Ishiba at the White House on Feb 7, President Trump said he wants to slash
the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
•  He added that Japan was looking to invest more in the U.S., and that Japan will soon begin
importing a record amount of new shipments of LNG from U.S. producers.
•  Trump also said the two nations plan to cooperate on Alaska oil and gas development.
•  CONTEXT: Ishiba made a 24-hour trip to the U.S. to ensure that Japan stays on solid footing with
Trump and his “America First” agenda. Both countries fear China’s growing economic and military
might and have concerns over North Korea.
•  CONTEXT: The U.S. has a $68 billion trade deficit with Japan. But over the last five years Japanese
companies have held the top spot for total FDI in the U.S.
•  While Trump said he won’t take the possibility of levying tariffs against Japan off the table, he
believes the issue can be resolved without punitive action.
•  “We have a trade deficit of over $100 billion but we’re going to work that out, very quickly,” said
Trump.
•  Trump plans to sign a deal on reciprocal trade next week. He seemed appeased by Ishiba’s pledge
that Japan would seek to invest another $1 trillion in the U.S.
•  Trump said that Nippon Steel was dropping its $14 billion takeover of U.S. Steel and would instead
make an “investment, rather than a purchase.” He even volunteered to mediate such a deal.
•  CONTEXT: President Biden, before leaving office last month, blocked the U.S. Steel purchase, citing
national security concerns.
•  Ishiba and Trump “agreed to cooperate more closely to combat Chinese economic aggression, which
is quite aggressive.”
• TAKEAWAY: For all the anxiety, Ishiba had a largely positive meeting with Trump, winning security guarantees,
keeping the talking points to those favorable to Japan, and even receiving some praise from the U.S. president.
Trump downplayed any conflicts between the U.S. and Japan, and pledged to use “the full strength of American
deterrence” to maintain security in the Indo-Pacific.

Now, however, Ishiba will need to follow through with his pledge for Japanese companies to invest even more
in the U.S.. That may placate Trump’s “America First” policy, but it could also make it harder to deliver on
reducing the trade deficit. We expect the energy sector to be one of the key investment areas for Japanese
firms.



Power companies face drop in profits; those without nuclear plants fare worst
(Company statements, media reports, Feb 7)
•  The 10 major power companies reported a 28% drop in net profit, April–Dec 2024, and which
totaled ¥1.26 trillion. Companies with operating nuclear plants showed stronger financial stability,
while those without saw their debt rise.
•  Five companies, including Tohoku Electric and Chugoku Electric, restarted their nuclear reactors,
reducing reliance on more costly coal- and gas-fired thermal power. Kansai, Kyushu, and Shikoku
Electric decreased debt by 2%. Utilities without operable NPPs saw debt increase by the same
percentage.
•  Kansai Electric’s stock price gained on nuclear restarts, allowing it to raise about ¥377 billion in
capital and boost its equity ratio to 30.7%, the highest since 1994.

•  TEPCO struggles with rising debt and negative cash flow due to the delay in bringing online its
Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP and costly safety upgrades.
•  CONTEXT: Bank of Japan interest rate hikes are expected to amplify debt burdens.



Nissan scraps merger talks with Honda
(Kyodo, Feb 7)
•  In the coming days, Nissan will end its talks with Honda around a potential merger, citing
disagreements over terms, including shareholding ratios. Honda proposed making Nissan a
subsidiary, which the latter resisted.
•  The merger, which aimed to form the world’s third-largest automotive group, was set to be finalized
by June 2025 under a holding company structure.
•  Honda's demand for faster and deeper restructuring at struggling Nissan, including further cost-
cutting beyond calls for 9,000 job cuts and a 20% production capacity reduction, created friction.
•  Negotiations on shareholding ratios also stalled, with Honda favoring a 5:1 valuation in its favor. As
a result, Honda proposed a direct takeover, further straining relations.
•  CONTEXT: While merger discussions are off the table for now, Nissan and Honda may still collaborate
on vehicle software and parts. Mitsubishi Motors, where Nissan is the top shareholder, is expected to
continue its cooperation with both companies. Taiwan’s Foxconn may also revive its interest in buying
Nissan.



AIST simulates Japan's energy supply-demand in 2050

(Institute statement, Feb 3)
•  The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, or AIST, said it simulated
Japan's energy supply and demand using a new mathematical model targeting carbon neutrality by
2050.
•  The model includes the impact of new technologies, such as hydrogen reduction steel production
and ammonia fuel, which weren’t included in previous models.
•  The simulation shows the amount of hydrogen and ammonia needed in 2050, and the amount of
CO2 removed through CCS in two cases with different demand conditions: high demand and low
demand.
o  In the high-demand case, the amount of imported hydrogen and ammonia is 26 million
tons in hydrogen equivalent, the same level as domestic production targets in the
"Hydrogen Basic Strategy for" and "Basic Policy for Realizing GX"; and the amount of CO2
removed is 169 million tons.
o  In low-demand, the amount of imported hydrogen and ammonia is 15 million tons
(hydrogen equivalent); the amount of CO2 removed is 141 million tons.
•  The amount of CO2 removed in the previous model was 215 million tons, so the amount of CO2
removed is down in both cases.
•  CONTEXT: AIST developed the "AIST-MARKAL (Market Allocation)" model that can simulate the entire
Japanese energy system, and has so far analyzed various scenarios for achieving carbon neutrality in
Japan by 2050. However, it didn’t take into account innovative technologies. The new mode, “AIST-
TIMES,” was developed to analyze Japan's energy system based on the TIMES energy framework
provided by the IEA.

fuel in the 1980s. Units 4 to 6 (700 MW each), are steam turbine plants fueled by LNG.
• TAKEAWAY: The JV allows JERA to expand its domestic baseload capacity but also minimize the risks. In recent
years, it has been Japan’s most aggressive utility in terms of investment and new business creation. JERA has
said previously that it seeks to become a publicly listed company.



J-Power sells U.S. thermal power assets
(Nikkei, Feb 3)
•  J-Power USA sold its stakes in four thermal power plants on Long Island, New York, including the
Pine Lawn and Edgewood plants.
•  The buyer was U.S.-based Hull Street Energy; the deal’s value wasn’t disclosed.
•  Total generation capacity of the assets amounts to 300 MW.
•  CONTEXT: As part of decarbonization, J-Power is restructuring its U.S. assets; sale proceeds will go to

renewables development overseas. Previously, J-Power held stakes in 11 U.S. thermal power plants, but
it’s selling off low-efficiency assets.


Shikoku Electric to study building LNG-fired unit

(Nikkei, Feb 3)
•  Shikoku Electric began a study to build Unit 5 at Sakaide Power Station (Kagawa Pref). Fueled by
LNG it will use a combined cycle system to reduce CO2.
•  The new unit (600 MW) will launch in FY2031, with thermal efficiency of 63%.
•  This month, Shikoku Electric submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment to METI, the
Governor of Kagawa Pref, and mayors of local cities.
•  CONTEXT: Sakaide Power Station has four units (total capacity 1.38 GW). Units 1 and 2 were
modernized in the 2010s. This will be the utility’s first new thermal power station construction project
in a quarter of a century.

METI announces FIT/ FIP for after FY2025
(Government statement, 3)
•  METI’s Procurement Price Calculation Committee issued its opinions and FIT/ FIP for after FY2025.
•  One of the main features for FY2026 is significantly increasing initial investment support for
installing rooftop solar power systems.
•  For the first five years, the support price for commercial systems will increase 60%, compared to
FY2025; as well as for the first four years for residential systems. After that, it will be reduced by
30-40%.
•  Since there are no recent bids and the supply/ demand for fuel is tight, support for FIT/ FIP will be
terminated from FY2026 for woody biomass power of 10 MW or more, and for liquid fuels.
•  Geothermal is expected to face less development risk as JOGMEC expands studies.

•  For hydropower, the price for each target category won’t change.
•  CONTEXT: The Procurement Price Calculation Committee discussed FIT procurement and FIP standard
prices from a medium- to long-term perspective, and by considering a reduction of the public burden
and impact on the power system.

METI publishes report on hedge accounting for electricity futures
(Government statement, Feb 6)
•  METI, together with power and commodities exchange TOCOM, published a report examining the
application of hedge accounting to electricity futures, aiming to defer unrealized gains and losses
until physical settlement.
•  The report clarifies the "buy hedge" approach for fixing spot market procurement prices, and
highlights the role of TOCOM and JEPX’s "JJ-Link" service in linking futures and spot transactions
for better transparency.
•  Key challenges include the mismatch between 30-minute spot market intervals and monthly futures
contracts, and uncertainty in estimating future spot transaction volumes, which complicates hedge
accounting eligibility.
•  The study suggests that if future contracts match spot transactions in area, timing, and quantity,

then effectiveness assessments could be waived. Industry participants emphasized the need for
monthly hedging units rather than individual time blocks.


EEX registers first trade in new electricity options contracts

(Company statement, Feb 4)
•  The European Energy Exchange (EEX) began trading electricity futures options for Tokyo and
Kansai, expanding its risk management offering.
•  The first transaction involved a call option for April with a strike price of ¥15/ kWh, a premium of
¥0.3, and 50 contracts (50 MW), with Tohoku Electric’s trading arm as the seller. Vanir Global
Markets brokered the trade.
•  CONTEXT: EEX became the first of the four electricity trading exchanges offering futures in Japan to
diversify into options.
• TAKEAWAY: Trading options have been often requested by financial players involved in Japan’s power markets
because such contracts can help facilitate price discovery. Wider adoption of options could also enable new
retail electricity pricing models as market-linked plans would be able to include certain price ceilings. So far,
there’s been limited appetite among households to experiment with market-linked pricing, but an increasing
number of corporations that are big power users, such as IT firms, are looking at ways to optimize their energy
procurement costs.



ANRE - balancing capacity procured via Reserve Capacity Utilization Contract

(Government statement, Feb 3)
•  ANRE made changes to the cost of securing balancing capacity to deal with forecast errors in
renewable energy.
•  CONTEXT: This refers to the Replacement Reserve-for FIT (RR-FIT) or 三次調整力② in Japanese,
which is sometimes translated as “tertiary adjustment capacity (type 2)”. It is used to cover errors in
forecasts for supply of renewable energy. Trading of this balancing / adjustment capacity is conducted
on the EPRX. The costs are covered by FIT subsidies as per the Renewable Energy Special Measures Act.
•  A FIT subsidy has only been available for RR-FIT in the balancing market, but it will also now
include balancing capacity procured through the Reserve Capacity Utilization Contracts that TSOs
conclude with power generation companies.
•  The change will be made retroactively to June 2024.
•  Since April 2024, procurement costs for delta kW (ΔkW), particularly for resources such as storage
batteries and DR, were judged by government experts to be very high and this caused a mismatch

7



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

between bids and offers. In order to reduce procurement costs, the amount of delta kW offered to
the market was reduced and the shortfall covered via Reserve Capacity Utilization Contracts.
•  The measures as above did not lead to higher procurement costs but did help push the contract
rates in the balancing market to 80-90%, up from around 50%. Thus it was judged appropriate to
make the Reserve Capacity Utilization Contracts eligible for FIT.



ANRE further reviews bidding requirements for reserve power supply system
(Government statement, Feb 5)
•  ANRE is discussing revisions to bidding requirements for the second round of reserve power supply
auction. Current bids are limited to power sources that were unsuccessful or didn’t bid for two
consecutive years in the main auction round of the capacity market.
•  Power generation companies want the cap to be changed to “one year” but there won’t be such a
change because it was judged that the impact would be limited.
•  On the other hand, the existence of an upper limit to the bid price, the so-called "reference price", is
considered a bigger issue and will be discussed.
•  CONTEXT: The reserve power system provides a certain amount of backup power in case power supply
is unstable, or a major power outage occurs. However, because there were no bids in the first auction to
secure power capacity for the reserve system, the government initiated talks with thermal power plant
operators to see how the system can be improved.
• TAKEAWAY: A reserve power supply is important for the proper functioning of the entire energy system, so
energy officials have to find a way to entice the utilities to participate. As of now, there have been no major
changes to the auction framework and if that continues the likelihood of zero bids is high.

•  Mitsubishi Corp will oversee commercial aspects and operations. Takasago Thermal Engineering
will provide solar-powered electrolysis equipment; and Miura Industries will design and deliver the
hydrogen-fueled boilers.
•  The first 10 years in operation will be a testing period. If successful, the tech will expand to other
Kirin factories.
•  CONTEXT: This is Mitsubishi's first domestic green hydrogen supply project. Other manufacturers using
on-site green hydrogen production facilities to fuel boilers include Kirin’s rival, Suntory, and auto parts
maker Denso.

Battery industry faces security risks and cost pressures: execs say
(Japan NRG, Feb 5)
•  Former Maxell Chairman Senzai Yoshihiro warned that low-cost foreign batteries, especially from
China, are starting to dominate Japan’s market despite security concerns, such as vulnerabilities in
remotely controlled systems.
•  Chinese models are cheaper but there is a gap with domestic products in terms of quality, Senzai
said at the ZET Summit for cleantech in Kyoto. These imports are also a cyber security risk.
•  Future trends for batteries include a move to a dry-process tech that simplifies production, improves
safety, and maintains discharge rates better.

Lawsuit to halt Kansai Electric's nuclear plants concludes
(Jiji, Feb 6)
•  A lawsuit to halt operations at Kansai Electric’s NPPs along Fukui Pref’s Wakasa Bay has ended in
Otsu District Court, with a ruling scheduled for Dec 25.
•  Filed by 47 residents of Shiga and Osaka, the lawsuit targets Mihama Unit 3, Ooi Units 3 & 4, and
Takahama Units 1–4, citing aging reactors and seismic risks.
•  Plaintiffs argued that the plants, operating for over 30 years, are at risk due to active faults in the
area and criticized the NRA’s safety standards as unreasonable.
•  Kansai Electric countered that safety measures, including inspections and tsunami countermeasures,
meet regulatory standards and urged the court to dismiss the case.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite the moderate success in restarting more reactors in Japan, the risk of citizen lawsuits
against operating and idled facilities has not receded. While most suits have not been upheld and don’t impede
operations, they have an effect. In May 2022, a Sapporo district court ordered Hokkaido Electric to keep its
Tomari NPP offline due to safety concerns from 1,000 citizen plaintiffs. While the court did not demand the
decommissioning of the facility, the ruling complicated approval from local authorities. The Tomari NPP
remains under regulatory review for a restart.

Canada pitches LNG to Japan as faster alternative to U.S.

(Japan NRG, Feb 6)
•  A Canadian delegation visited Japan last week to promote LNG exports as a faster, reliable
alternative to U.S. supply. The group included government officials, the Energy for a Secure Future
Canada group and First Nations LNG Alliance.
•  Canada says that shipments from its west coast, British Columbia, take just 10 days to reach Asia,
compared to 25-30 days from the Gulf Coast via the Panama Canal.
•  CONTEXT: Japan, which imports about 90% of its primary energy, can store LNG for only 2-3 weeks,
making delivery speed a critical factor in securing stable supplies. The nearest LNG seller to Japan is
Russia with its Sakhalin 2 project.
•  Canadian LNG proponents say its projects offer additional advantages, including lower emissions
due to hydroelectric-powered production, a colder climate that improves efficiency, and tighter
regulatory oversight compared to the U.S.
•  Canadian officials met with representatives from JERA, JOGMEC, and the government to discuss
future collaboration.
• TAKEAWAY: As Trump seeks to boost U.S. exports of LNG and other energy, Asian nations are among the top
prospective buyers. However, as retaliation against Trump’s blanket tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S.,
Beijing put 15% levies on American gas. China buys 6% of its LNG from the U.S. but with the tariffs in place its
importers intend to resell their cargos and look for alternatives. It also means future Chinese offtakes from U.S.
projects are very unlikely. U.S.-China tensions potentially raise the value of Canadian LNG projects. It will be
important for Canada’s first export facility to start shipping cargo this year to enhance the reputation of
Canadian projects.

What’s Next After Mitsubishi Corp’s Threat to

Walk Away from Offshore Wind?
In 2021, Mitsubishi Corp won Japan’s first-ever public tender for large-scale offshore
wind farms. Technically, it was picked due to offering the lower price. Many suspected
that it was the trading house’s financial muscle, huge network and trusted ties with
METI officials that swung the deal.

Fast forward to today and the firm is indicating a potential withdrawal from the three
projects it secured, as well as the domestic offshore wind sector in general. Mitsubishi
and its partner Chubu Electric claim the challenges and costs they face far exceed their
expectations and cannot simply be endured.
On Feb 6, Mitsubishi announced ¥52 billion ($344 million) in writedowns on its three
domestic offshore wind projects. Chubu Electric faces ¥18 billion in writedowns on the
same.

The common assumption was that if anyone was able to navigate the bureaucratic,
technical and financial complexities of building a new sector in Japan it would be
Mitsubishi. The challenges have, however, piled up: post-pandemic supply chain shocks;
war and sanctions; the weakest yen in four decades; a labor crunch; NIMBY and an
anti-renewables backlash.

The result has been massive cost inflation, what Mitsubishi called “material changes in
the macroeconomic environment.” Both Mitsubishi and Chubu Electric said they have
put the business plans for the three projects under review.
For the government, the threat of a pullout by the operators has grave consequences.
The rollout of offshore wind capacity is already behind schedule. The nation’s CO2
reduction goals, enshrined in international commitments, hinge on multi-GW additions
of clean power, and offshore wind farms seem to be the only options to deliver on such
scale.

None of the options before METI are easy. Can the government offer Mitsubishi and
partners additional subsidies? Or more time to complete the projects? If so, what about
other auction winners or future bidders? If Mitsubishi does quit, will the next-best
bidders take their place? And, most importantly, can Japan afford to leave these
projects or let Mitsubishi sink given the message that it would send on offshore wind
opportunities in the country?
The ultimatum and what’s behind it
A consortium led by Mitsubishi’s subsidiary Mitsubishi Corporation Offshore Wind is
developing offshore wind projects in three Japanese sea areas off the coast of: (1)
Noshiro City, Mitane Town and Oga City in Akita Prefecture, (2) Yurihonjo City in Akita
Prefecture, and (3) Choshi City (Chiba Prefecture). The wind farms have a total
projected capacity of 1.76 GW and come online 2028-2030.

Mitsubishi’s group offered the following strike prices for the projects:
▪  (1) Noshiro-Mitane-Oga: ¥13,260/ MWh;
▪  (2) Yurihonjo: ¥11,990/ MWh;
▪  (3) Choshi: ¥16,490/ MWh.

The wind industry has been looking closely at the progress of Mitsubishi’s projects,
wondering if the 2028 deadline was feasible. Mitsubishi’s win was not scandal-free. It
bid prices notably lower than rival consortiums, sweeping all three large Round 1
projects. The scale of the win prompted a review of the bidding scheme and a shift in
the scoring system to favor project feasibility over pricing.

On Feb 6, as Mitsubishi announced the large-scale writedowns, President Nakanishi
Katsuya confirmed that inflation, the yen weakness and geopolitical risks have caused
damage “far beyond our initial expectations.” Further impairment losses are possible.

Construction of the three wind farms has stalled, he said, and “it is not possible to say
anything about the delivery date.” The price tag of a wind power project is dominated
by upfront capital costs for the wind turbines. It can be as much as 84% of the total
installation outlay, covering blades, the tower and transformer; civil works; grid
connection fees; and other construction and planning expenses.
Almost all wind turbines in Japan are imported or assembled with largely overseas
parts. And yet, between January 2021 and June 2024, the yen depreciated by over 50%
against the U.S. dollar. Add to this the surge in raw material prices and EPC fees, and
the math on Mitsubishi’s projects has been turned on its head. With offtakers that
signed up for long-term PPAs linked to the projects unwilling to revise their terms, the
viability of the offshore wind farms was put into question.
Both Chubu Electric and Mitsubishi announced significant hits to their revenue for the
nine-month period of 2024. Mitsubishi had engaged in months of talks with officials to
find other ways to compensate for the mounting costs. Officials relented but only in part
– METI and MLIT on Jan 29 promised to revise offshore wind tender guidelines to
include enhanced risk scenario assessments and other adjustments to cover currency,
inflation and other macro factors. Higher costs will be partly incorporated into the
electricity purchase price.

This helps bidders in the next round, which is expected to be announced in a few
months. But the changes are not retroactive. Mitsubishi’s threat to quit its three projects
is a law-straw ultimatum to METI and MLIT to pressure the government to shoulder
19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

some of the rising costs in order to save the projects and prevent delays. Officials will
fear the consequences of not meeting the requests, as it could discourage future bidders.
However, revisiting adjudicated bids is also a Pandora’s box that METI seeks to avoid.
Mitsubishi is not the only developer raising issues with global inflation, supply chains,
and rising interest rates. Similar factors led to a wave of project downsizing and
withdrawals in Europe and the U.S. even before President Trump renounced the sector’s
value.

Danish offshore wind developers were set to pay $125 million in penalties to New
Jersey for the cancellation of a 2.25 GW Ocean Wind 1 & 2 project in 2023. The
Japanese tender scheme does not currently envision penalties for withdrawals.

What happens next?
There are several potential scenarios:

1. The Mitsubishi-led consortium withdraws from the projects which are then
offered to runners-up from Round 1. That would potentially open the door to
JERA, J-Power and Equinor to take two of the sites, and TEPCO RE and Orsted the
other. However, Orsted and Equinor have already left the Japanese market. The
legal ramifications of this are also unclear: Would the runners-up be obliged to
deliver and stick to their original bid price?
2. The government allows bid price revisions or offers other subsidies to recover
inflated costs. The challenges would be in setting a fair compensation formula and
in firewalling the support. The fourth tender in Round 1 was for a smaller,
floating wind turbine project and that also faces cost and time problems. The
consortium in charge, led by Toda Corp, could request a similar review. Bidders
from Round 2 and 3 would also have a case for renegotiations. Mitsubishi’s
support would act as a precedent for future discussions.
3. A state-aligned actor agrees to invest in or to provide cheap loans at the project
level, helping to co-finance the construction and share the liabilities. Alternatively,
the Mitsubishi consortiums form ventures with new investors, who inject capital.
The state-aligned actors could include JOGMEC, JBIC, the Development Bank of
Japan, or maybe a repurposing of the Green Innovation Fund or one of the GX
budgets. The commercial aspect involved would be tough for officials to engage
with and, again, METI has to be careful to avoid perception of favoritism.

4. The projects are delayed to allow developers time to negotiate new terms for
equipment, construction, and potentially to revisit offtake contracts.

None of the options are straightforward or appealing to the government, but the fact
that Mitsubishi and Chubu Electric have decided to voice their concerns in public
suggests that they believe they have a strong negotiating position and can muster wider
industry support. What’s more, METI needs Mitsubishi’s support in other energy sectors,
such as with future American LNG and ammonia investments.
For Mitsubishi, the stakes are high, and not just because of the valuation writedowns. If
the company quits a domestic project, bids in overseas offshore wind tenders will be
questioned. The fallout would affect partners such as Chubu Electric, GE, Kajima, and
local businesses.

It’s also likely METI was made aware of the upcoming ultimatum and is already in talks
to find a solution that helps all sides avoid losing face. The offshore wind generation
sector in Japan is about to undergo major changes.

Nuclear Power Overview: Which Reactors are in Line to Restart?

In the past year, only one nuclear reactor in Japan has received regulatory approval to
restart. Even that does not guarantee that the facility will go online – a situation TEPCO
knows all too well. Each year the country’s biggest utility announces plans to switch on
its nuclear units and each year it fails to do so.
The stasis in Japan’s nuclear power sector was masked by a recent period of mild
success: in each of the last two years, two reactors were restarted, bringing the total
number of units able to generate electricity to 14. The outlook for the next two years is
more problematic.

Since shutting all nuclear stations in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake in
March 2011, Japan has struggled to revive the sector. Despite bursts of progress, the
restart of the 33 reactors designated as operable is going slower than planned, mired in
inspections and continuing upgrades. The cost of care and maintenance and new safety
upgrades alone runs into trillions of yen.

Still, the government’s belief in the necessity of nuclear power in Japan has remained
and has even strengthened based on the latest Basic Energy Plan draft, submitted in
December 2024. Other commitments to nuclear energy were made at international
forums such as COP28.
Last year, Tohoku Electric's Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2 (825 MW) restarted,
shortly followed by Chugoku Electric's Shimane Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2 (820
MW). Both are both BWRs, the same type as Fukushima Daiichi, marking the first
BWR restart since 2011. These two reignited hope for the quicker restarts of other
NPPs.

Given state backing, which reactors are likely to be brought back online next? Japan
NRG takes a close look at how much of the nearly 20 GW in nuclear capacity that sits
idle is likely to deliver electrons to the market in the near and mid-term future.
Reactor status report
Currently, there are 33 reactors that are classed as operable and 3 more under
construction. But the number actually in operation as of Feb 4 was 12. Another two are
offline for maintenance.

The remaining 19 reactors are classed as operable but lack either approval from the
nuclear regulator, the NRA, or the local authorities (i.e. prefectural governors and local
mayors). Both regulatory and political approvals have no specific deadlines. In some
cases, the NRA has conducted a review of a reactor’s application in excess of a decade.

At present, 11 of the 19 idled units could be described as “in the process” of restarting,
with three of those having obtained regulator approval. The final eight operable units
have not even applied to the NRA.
Of the 19.8 GW in nuclear power still offline, the reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP,
operated by TEPCO account for about 40% – 8.2 GW. With power demand in the
Tokyo-centered region one of the most constrained in the country, a restart of at least
one of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s units seemed to be on the cards a year ago. But it has yet
to proceed.

METI’s plan
According to METI's draft Basic Energy Plan unveiled at the end of 2024, nuclear
power’s share in the energy mix should reach about 20% by 2040. Hitting such a target
will require the full operation of nearly all Japan’s existing reactors.
This robust and ambitious restart policy is best confirmed by the removal of the call in
the previous Plan to “reduce dependence on nuclear power as much as possible’’.

At COP28, METI announced a joint declaration with 23 countries to "triple the global
nuclear power generation capacity by 2050 compared to 2020 levels." Japan aims to
contribute by developing and constructing reactors and strengthening the nuclear
supply chain.

Domestically, METI is promoting the replacement of decommissioned nuclear power
plants. It’s also introducing new regulations on the operational period of nuclear plants
in 2025. For plants in operation for more than 30 years, operators will conduct a
technical assessment of equipment deterioration every 10 years. Based on the results,
they must develop a "Long-Term Facility Management Plan" and get approval from the
NRA. Additionally, METI is working to improve the run rates of existing nuclear plants.
While that’s overall good news for the nuclear sector, TEPCO is struggling financially
due to rising construction costs for nuclear and power transmission facilities, as well as
increased competition in electricity sales. The utility requires an annual ¥500 billion to
cover Fukushima disaster-related decommissioning costs and compensation.

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, Units 6-7
When it comes to restarting nuclear power plants, all eyes are on TEPCO. The company
is working toward reactivating Units 6 and 7 at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP. Operation of
one unit could improve annual revenue by about ¥100 billion.
TEPCO already fitted Unit 7 with nuclear fuel, but the plant’s reactivation timeline is
contingent on obtaining local support. While TEPCO seeks reactivation in FY2025, it is
also now considering a delay to FY2026 and beyond. That would be 3-4 years later than
what the utility announced in its previous business plan, made in FY2021. TEPCO’s
lenders are also starting to raise concerns.

The delayed scenario anticipates a local decision after the Niigata gubernatorial election
in 2026. On the restart, Niigata Governor Hanazumi Hideyo did not specify a timeline,
only saying that he was monitoring public opinion. His approval is essential, but the
process also requires local business groups and prefectural assemblies to acquiesce. In
Niigata, support in the assembly is lacking, but there are voices for a referendum on the
issue.
In the meantime, the plant was again in the news recently for all the wrong reasons.
Small malfunctions at communication devices happened three times in the last three
months. While the issues are not dangerous, they still constitute deviations from
regulated norms.

In any case, local authorities declared that the plant will not restart before FY2025. As a
consequence, no restart is likely to happen before early summer.

Tokai NPP No. 2
In 2018, another reactor received NRA restart approval — Japan Atomic Power's Tokai
No.2. Changes to the reactor installation and other requirements followed the post-
Fukushima regulations. TEPCO holds over 28% of JAPC’s shares based on voting rights.
This 1.1 GW boiling-water reactor resisted the 2011 earthquake with an automatic shut
down and faced the ensuing tsunami unfazed. But Tokai No. 2 is one of the oldest units
in Japan, having entered operation in 1978.

The electricity generated by the plant was sold to TEPCO and Tohoku Electric. Soon
after the restart approval, the then 40-year-old reactor was given the green light to
extend operation for an extra 20 years. Despite all these, the plant is still idle.

It faced a series of hardships that have hindered the restart. First, it needs to complete
new safety measures, but their completion was delayed until the end of 2026. The issue
revolves around deficiencies in the seawall, currently under construction. The
completion of the reinforcement works led to a third restart postponement in 2024.
Relations with the public have grown tense. In 2021, the Mito District Court ordered the
plant’s suspension. It sided with 224 plaintiffs claiming that disaster preparedness was
inadequate and that the company underestimated potential earthquake intensity.

The court also reviewed whether the reactor was fit for continued use, despite the 20-
year extension granted in 2018. The biggest issue is with evacuation plans for areas
within a 30-kilometer radius. There is a need for plans to evacuate 940,000 residents,
the largest number for any nuclear plant in Japan.

This implies the need to coordinate with 14 municipalities, which have to prepare their
own plans. The complexity of a safe evacuation in case of emergency was also stressed
at the end of 2023. The Ibaraki government estimated that up to 170,000 people would
need to evacuate in case of an accident.
Tokai No. 2 has experienced five fire incidents since 2023, prompting preventive
measures in May 2024. In December 2024, a fire broke out during welding work,
injuring a worker. JAPC confirmed no radiation exposure or radioactive material
release.

Also, the dire
situation at
JAPC’s Tsuruga
NPP No. 2,
deemed unfit for
restart due to an
active fault,
makes the
utility's financial
situation risky.
This could also
impact restarting
Tokai No. 2.

Other plants
As Ishiyama Kazuhiro prepares to take over the presidency of Tohoku Electric, he
emphasized the company’s commitment to restarting reactors. Specifically, the company
is targeting the restart of Higashidori Unit 1 in Aomori Prefecture and Onagawa Unit 3
in Miyagi Prefecture.
Onagawa Unit 2’s restart is expected to boost annual profits by about ¥60 billion.
Tohoku Electric needs this since it has a low equity ratio of 17.5% as of December 2024.

Chubu Electric is also advancing plans to restart the Hamaoka NPP in Omaezaki City,
Shizuoka Prefecture. In November 2024, the NRA initiated a plant inspection, and
Chubu Electric announced plans to raise the height of the existing seawall from 22
meters to 28 meters to counter potential tsunamis from the Nankai Trough.

The company aims to complete the plant inspection by 2026. The financial strategy for
funding the seawall, potentially costing around ¥180 billion, is under consideration,
including options like issuing new corporate bonds.
In the northern region of Hokkaido, Hokkaido Electric (HEPCO) is progressing toward
the restart of its Tomari NPP's Unit 3. At the end of 2024, HEPCO completed its
explanations to the NRA regarding the plant's safety measures.

HEPCO is building a new seawall, aiming for completion by March 2027, with plans to
restart Unit 3 thereafter. The timeline, however, is uncertain due to regulatory reviews.

Conclusion
The average capacity factor of domestic NPPs in FY2024 was 30.6%, up 2.6 points from
FY2023. In the same timeframe, nuclear facilities delivered 88.87 TWh of electricity (up
9.6% from the previous year).

These numbers are at their highest since 2015: coupled with clear political support,
Japan’s nuclear industry seems on the verge of a revival. The 14 reactors restarted since
2015 have brought an extra 13.3 GW of capacity to the grid.
The next steps are the hardest though. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP is a political challenge
as much as a technical one. Tokai No.2 continues to delay its works, and its operator is
in a weak financial situation. But these two are the most likely candidates.

Most idled reactors in Japan have a scheduled restart date that’s a couple of years
beyond FY2025. Unless the government is able to muster new powers of persuasion in
Niigata or Hokkaido, no additional restarts look likely this year, and maybe even the
next.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Clean finance
Australia is setting aside an additional $2 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corp
(CEFC) to develop renewable energy sources. In 2024, the CEFC invested more than $4
billion in local projects, unlocking around $12 billion in private investment that went to
regional areas.
Australia / Solar and wind energy
Studies continue for the planned Western Green Energy Hub that spans 22,700 sq km,
and which will house 60 million solar panels and 3,000 next-gen wind turbines, each
capable of producing up to 20 MW, with plans to generate annually 200 TWh of clean
energy – almost as much as Australia’s entire electricity output.

China / LNG
President Trump's emerging trade war with Beijing poses a new threat to billions of
dollars in planned U.S. LNG export projects, many of which rely on China as a key
buyer, according to analysts.
India / Renewable energy
About 50 GW of renewable energy was installed in India in 2024, of which nearly half
are from solar power, said JMK Research & Analytics. Solar energy added 24.6 GW of
capacity, while wind added 3.4 GW.

India / PPAs
Amazon has signed two PPAs for a combined 199 MW across two wind projects. The
first was signed with CleanMax for a 100 MW wind under development in Karnataka.
The second PPA was signed with BluPine Energy, an Indian renewable energy
developer, for a 99 MW wind project.
Indonesia / Nuclear power
Indonesia, the most populous nation in SE Asia, is expected to deploy the first small
modular nuclear reactor (SMR) in the region by 2030.

South Korea / Oil and Gas
Hopes for a major oil and gas project may not be economically feasible, the energy
ministry said. Recent drilling showed some signs of gas prospects but the amount was
not believed to be meaningful. The project was announced in June 2024, when the area
was thought to hold as much as 14 billion barrels of oil and gas. The site is off the
southeastern port of Pohang.
Thailand / Decarbonization
Thailand seeks to be a regional leader in low-carbon innovation, driven by its 2050
carbon neutrality and 2065 net-zero targets. Atoms for Peace is one framework to
support the development of nuclear power plants. The cabinet has also approved solar
energy expansion.

Vietnam / Gas and offshore wind
Ten-year power-production targets for gas and offshore wind have been lowered, with
coal and other renewables expected to fill the gap until nuclear reactors are included in
the energy mix by 2035.
