JSE to build liquefied hydrogen import terminal in Kawasaki by FY2028

(Japan NRG, July 25)
•  Japan Suiso Energy plans to build a liquefied hydrogen import terminal in the Kawasaki waterfront
(Kanagawa Pref) on a 21-hectare property owned by JFE Steel.
•  The terminal will have at least one tank sized 50,000 m3, and port facilities accommodating ships
sized between 60,000-160,000 m2.
•  JSO signed a property lease with JFE Steel. Tanks, loading and gasification facilities will be built by
FY2028.
•  Bulkships will begin offloading liquefied hydrogen imports on a trial basis in FY2029, and will begin

commercial operations by FY2030.
•  CONTEXT: Kawasaki Heavy and Iwatani, the JSO shareholders, run a small terminal with a 150-ton
tank in Kobe for testing. The Kawasaki facility would be Japan’s first liquefied hydrogen import
terminal. The company is also building a liquefied hydrogen export terminal in Hastings, Australia.
• TAKEAWAY: This is an ambitious plan. Tank manufacturer Toyo Kanetsu, which is building a 5,000 m3 tank for
liquefied hydrogen storage, said the biggest challenge in building larger tanks is securing the necessary raw

materials to maintain temperatures at -253 C.




AT TOKYO inks PPA with TEPCO EP for renewable energy supply to data center
(Company statement, July 18)
•  AT TOKYO, a data center operator, signed an offsite physical corporate PPA with Advance

Maintenance and Tokyo Electric Power Energy Partner (TEPCO EP) to supply renewable energy to
its data center.
•  The agreement involves supplying about 3.8 GWh/ year from three solar farms in Tochigi and
Ibaraki prefs that are owned by Advance Maintenance Co; their total nameplate capacity is 3.6
MW.
•  This supply will account for about 10% of the annual electricity consumption of AT TOKYO’s third
data center, with the remainder covered by non-fossil certificate services from TEPCO EP.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

ENEOS starts supplying green power under corporate PPAs
(Company statement, July 18)
o  ENEOS Renewable Energy began supplying renewable energy to Japan Wool Textile Co
via Kansai Electric using a corporate PPA.
o  The energy is sourced from about 1.5 MW of low-voltage solar power plants in the Kansai

area, jointly developed by ENEOS Renewable Energy and Takahashi.

Toyota to set up EV battery plant in Kyushu near its car factory
(Nikkei, July 26)
•  Toyota Motor is reported to plan a EV battery plant in Kyushu. The company will position Kyushu,
which is home to many auto and chip plants, as a central part of its EV supply chain and an export

base to Asia.
•  Toyota's battery manufacturing subsidiary, Primearth EV Energy, will operate the plant. METI is
expected to provide subsidies for its construction.




Govt mulls subsidies, tax cut incentives for decarbonized power
(Nikkei, July 23)
•  The govt is studying subsidies and corporate tax cut incentives to businesses consuming
decarbonized power, to drive creation of clusters of businesses around regions with renewables
and clean energy supplies.
•  Typical targets are AI-driven businesses, data centers and other businesses with strong demand for

decarbonized power. These consumers are expected to build operational bases in Hokkaido,
Kansai, Kyushu, Akita and Aomori areas with renewable supplies.
•  The govt plans amending the GX Promotion Act next year to allow financing by state transition
bonds.
• TAKEAWAY: Providing demand-side incentives hasn’t been a major part of the support ecosystem for
renewable energy projects, although this is one of the main approaches driving the rollout of hydrogen.

Demand-side incentives will certainly be welcome, although non-Japanese businesses that seek to buy green
electricity often quote the availability of necessary volumes as the major issue, rather than the costs.
This news also chimes with the recent shift to a GX 2.0 energy policy that tries to marry development of clean

energy with investment in new industrial capacities.




Kyoto Fusioneering secures ¥1 bln in latest funding round
(Company statement, July 23)
•  Kyoto Fusioneering (KF) secured ¥1.07 billion from four new investors in the second close of its
Series C extension round.
•  This brings the total raised in Series C to ¥13.1 billion, with a cumulative total of ¥14.8 billion

raised since the company's start in 2019.
•  The new funds will be used to speed up investment in R&D (including projects UNITY-1 and
UNITY-2), promote global business development and recruiting efforts, as well as secure working
capital for large project orders and business expansion.
•  CONTEXT: UNITY-1 is KF's fusion power generation test facility, which focuses on high-
temperature heat transportation. UNITY-2 is a fusion fuel cycle test facility to advance fuel cycle

technologies

Tokio Marine to offer insurance for greenwashing claims
(Company statement, July 19)
•  Tokio Marine Nichido Fire Insurance has introduced "Carbon Credit Reputation Expense
Insurance" for companies purchasing carbon credits, covering crisis management and risk

assessment costs.
•  The insurance addresses those costs related to crisis management consulting, legal fees, the
expense of a media and online response, and other crisis response measures in case the purchase
of the credits leads to greenwashing accusations.
•  CONTEXT: The introduction of the GX voluntary carbon credit trading scheme on the Japan Stock
Exchange last year is due to lead to a more formalized carbon credits market in coming years.
Globally, Tokio Marine says that the carbon credits market could be worth $50 billion by 2030.




Sekisui Chemical, Cosmo trial PSCs on tanks at industrial sites

(Company statement, July 19)
•  Cosmo Oil and Sekisui Chemical began joint demos with Asahi Etic Co, a company in the
construction industry, to install film-type perovskite solar cells (PSC) on the roofs of service stations
and on the walls of tanks at business sites.
•  Over the course of a year, starting this July, the demo will verify installation and construction
methods on vertical curved surfaces, such as the tank walls of industrial facilities; while Asahi Etic
will also install PSC on roofs with low load-bearing capacity, such as of service stations.

• TAKEAWAY: The number of PSC trials is proliferating
this year. This month, JGC Corp is another to trial the
technology on the roof of a park facility in Enoshima,
in collaboration with EneCoat Technologies. Most of
the demos are for locations that would not necessarily
be open to solar panels due to weight or uneven

surfaces. This suggests that there is an understanding
in the market that PSC is not coming to directly
challenge existing polysilicon-based solar PV, but
rather, is a potential option in new use cases. These
trials should give an idea of how feasible PSC will be
as a commercial technology in the coming years. In
this context, the govt’s targets to have PSC operate

on a commercial basis starting 2025 or 2026 might be
overly optimistic.

JGC begins search for perovskite solar farm partners
(Japan NRG, July 24)
•  JGC Corp began recruiting agriculture farms for solar power stations using perovskite solar cells
(PSC) supplied by EneCoat Technologies.
•  JGC has developed a plastic sheet with a PSC module layer that can be placed on top of crops, or

used as curtains of greenhouses.
•  CONTEXT: PSC sheets are easier to install compared to silicon panels, which need to be mounted
securely on racks.
• TAKEAWAY: Farmers are interested in wavelength-selective PV cells that are colorless and transparent.
However, they tend to push back against solar modules that are colored black, as they think the modules will
block plants’ photosynthesis. EneCoat products are black.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Panasonic pushes forward perovskite commercialization
(Nikkei, July 26)
o  Panasonic plans to commercialize glass-mounted perovskite solar cell (PSC) modules in

2026, two years ahead of its original plan.
o  This fall, the company will begin running prototype production lines of building-
integrated modules at its Osaka R&D facility.




METI and Aomori discuss Mutsu interim spent nuclear fuel facility
(Jiji Press, July 23)
•  During a meeting with the Aomori Pref Governor, METI's Minister Saito discussed plans for an
interim spent nuclear fuel facility in Mutsu. He suggested that the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant

could be a potential processing destination.
•  CONTEXT: The Mutsu facility now under construction will be Japan's first interim storage facility
for spent nuclear fuel. It’s built to store fuel for up to 50 years. The operating company, which is
partially funded by TEPCO, aims to launch by late Sept.
•  The governor's decision on a safety agreement between the company, Aomori pref and the city, is
a crucial factor. Local assemblies are worried about the potential extension of the 50 years
timeline, and so they emphasize the need for a clear plan for future disposal.

• TAKEAWAY: The success of Mutsu’s facility is closely intertwined with the fate of Rokkasho’s reprocessing
plant that’s expected to be the next place to store spent fuel after the Mutsu facility’s 50-year limit. However,
many in the municipal and prefectural assemblies fear that the Rokkasho plant, which has already seen 26
delays, will face another delay as the operators try to fulfill the NRA’s requirements. Until the govt can secure a
concrete plan and the proposed facilities are already operational for spent nuclear fuel, interim storage
facilities will always be met with resistance by locals.

Tokyo Century will invest ¥20 bln in Sustainable Battery Holdings
(Company statement, July 23)
•  Leasing company Tokyo Century, via its subsidiary TC Investment Partners, will invest in
Sustainable Battery Holdings (SBH) alongside Advantage Partners and Furukawa Electric; SBH will

acquire the Furukawa Battery Co (FBC).
•  AP78, an SBH subsidiary, will hold a tender to acquire all outstanding shares of FBC from
shareholders for about ¥19.6 billion.
•  Furukawa Electric will own about 20% of SBH; AP Fund 60% and TC Investment Partners 20%. FBC
will delist as a consolidated subsidiary of Furukawa Electric.




CCS site exploration rules take effect Aug 5
(Government statement, July 23)
•  The Cabinet approved METI’s proposal to bring into force, effective Aug 5, CCS exploration rules

defined in the CCS Business Act.
•  CONTEXT: METI has selected nine Advanced CCS Projects for Commercialization to receive
support from carbon capture to storage, aiming to realize their commercialization before 2030.
Their total storage capacity is 6-12 mln tons/ year of CO2.




Wind Association proposes relaxing forestry law
(JWPA statement, July 25)
•  Before an ANRE panel studying ways to increase renewables installations, the Japan Wind Power
Association proposed relaxing forestry law.

•  Such projects are banned in protected forest areas. The govt should find ways to allow projects in
the protected areas, said the JWPA.
•  It also urged stronger measures to increase “renewable promotion zones” by the national govt,
the municipalities and developers working closer together.
• TAKEAWAY: A number of prefectures have either passed a law or say they will try to do so restricting the
cutting of trees for solar and wind power projects. It would be odd for the national govt to relax forestry law at
a time when regional authorities are seeking to tighten regulation in this area. However, the wind industry

lobby group may be able to use this approach to push the national govt to help find new areas where onshore
wind projects are welcome, similar to the zoning for offshore wind.




Govt prepares plan for agricultural version of AZEC

(Japan NRG, July 24)
•  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries officials proposed to PM Kishida to organize an
agricultural version of the Asia Zero Emission Community.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Akiba Kazuhiko, head of Tokai Regional Agricultural Administration Office, said that new rules are
needed to build cross-border food value chains.
•  “PM Kishida appeared keen on the idea of spreading the concept of varied zero emission
pathways to agriculture”, said Akiba.
•  CONTEXT: MAFF aims for a carbon neutral agricultural sector by 2050. Akiba was one of the

MAFF task force members for writing the “Green Strategy for Sustainable Food Systems”.
• TAKEAWAY: Low-methane rice growing now being developed in Japan could be the hydrogen/ ammonia/
CCS equivalent technologies shared among AZEC members.




Marubeni leads testing used tires as battery material for street lighting

(Company statement, July 22)
•  Marubeni and 17 partner companies launched a pilot using so-called ‘tire batteries’ to support
continuous operation of solar-powered street lights. The demo will run to late October.
•  CONTEXT: Used tires are decomposed and processed to extract useful substances, which are then
added to ionic materials (such as eggshells) to create electrodes for a storage battery.
•  About 10 tons of used tires are required to meet the electricity needs of 42 households at the
current stage of this battery development, but the firms involved plan to improve the technology’s
efficiency.

•  The technology has been in development for 12 years. It is meant to be paired with renewable
energy sources.
•  Other firms involved in the Tire Battery Project are Renesas, ENEOS Materials, and Sangyo Denko.




Tokyo govt offers subsidies up to ¥100 mln for next-gen renewables demos
(Government statement, July 19)
•  The Tokyo Metropolitan Govt began accepting applications for a subsidy program to support
demos of next-gen renewable energy technologies. Up to ¥100 million will be provided, covering

two-thirds of the expenses.
•  Grants will be awarded to power generation projects in solar, wind, biomass, hydro, geothermal
and other forms of renewable energy that have passed the R&D stage but are yet to be put into
practice.
•  The proposal deadline is Aug 23. Total budget for “Next-Generation Renewable Energy
Technology Social Implementation Promotion Project” is ¥320 million.




Chubu Electric Miraiz to offer CO2-free electricity as part of tax gift

(Company statement, Japan NRG, July 19)
•  Chubu Electric Miraiz will work with Otari village to provide CO2-free electricity as a ‘thank-you’ for
those residents who donate part of their local tax to the village.

9



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Japan’s furusato nozei (Hometown Tax) scheme allows taxpayers to allocate some local
tax payments to municipalities other than the one in which they live. In return, the municipalities
often provide a gift as a ‘thank you’. This is the first instance of a locality offering electricity.
•  Otari Village has two local hydropower plants run by Chubu Electric. The company says that for
every ¥10,000 donated to Otari, taxpayers will get some CO2-free electricity (150 kWh) and a

¥2,500 discount on their power bill.

Hokkaido Electric aims to be first supplier of 100% ammonia-fired power

(Government statement, July 23)
•  Hokkaido Electric plans for 100% ammonia-fired power generation at Tomatoatsuma Unit 5 by the
middle of 2040’s; this would be earlier than JERA, which recently completed its own 20% ammonia
co-firing trial at a coal-fired power plant.
•  Hokkaido Electric aims for 100% green ammonia-fired power, while other ammonia players – JERA
and Kobelco Power Kobe – plan to blend blue and green ammonia.
•  Tomatoatsuma Unit 5 has not been built yet. Its capacity was initially planned at 350 MW, but that

might change.
•  Ammonia firing will start at Tomatoatsuma Unit 4 (700 MW) in FY2030, with a blending ratio of
20%, but that will rise to 50% several years later.
•  JERA and Kobelco Power Kobe also plan 100% ammonia-firing in the late 2040’s.
•  In FY2027, JERA will commercialize 20% ammonia firing at its Hekinan Unit 4 (1 GW); and in
FY2029, JERA’s Hekinan Unit 5 (1 GW) and Kobelco’s Kobe units 1 and 2 (each 700 MW) will also
begin 20% ammonia co-firing.

•  CONTEXT: This week, OCCTO unveiled the decarbonization plans of power utilities that were
awarded supply contracts following the FY2023 long term decarbonized power auction (LTDA).
Hokkaido Electric and Kobelco won 132 MW contracts for each ammonia-firing facility; while JERA
won for a 187 MW facility.
• TAKEAWAY: Ammonia applications are expanding and diversifying as they replace fossil fuels not only in the
energy but in the manufacturing sectors. A gas inspector told Japan NRG that the safety regulations may need

to be rewritten if small-scale ammonia burners begin to spread. Two ammonia slip incidents were reported so
far this year due to errors by contractors. It seems that some ammonia users may not have the capacity to
manage and train contractors, a local ammonia supplier said.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

CEFH2 to begin 35% hydrogen-fired power in FY2029
(Government statement, July 23)
o  CEFH2 plans hydrogen-coal co-firing at Miike Unit 2 (175 MW) in FY2029, and a shift to
100% hydrogen firing at Unit 3 that will be built around 2032.
o  The company was awarded a 55 MW supply contract during the FY2023 LTDA (long-term
decarbonization capacity auction).
o  Kansai Electric plans hydrogen-LNG co-firing at three power stations in about 2039-2040,

at a blending ratio of 20-50%.
o  Tohoku Electric and Chugoku Electric also plan a 20-50% hydrogen co-firing in about
2039-2040.
o  Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas each plan power partly fueled by synthetic methane (e-
methane) in the 2040’s.

OCCTO  to float first backup power auction in Aug-Sept
(OCCTO statement, July 24)
•  OCCTO will hold the first backup power auction for a total capacity of 2 GW, to be available
during FY2025-2026. Bids can be submitted from August to late Sept.
•  The backup power system covers power supplies that fall outside the scope of capacity auctions as

such facilities have been mothballed. They are activated in times of power supply crunches.
•  Auction results will be released in late December.
•  CONTEXT: The backup power system is designed to sustain thermal power generation capacities
by keeping them under care and maintenance rather than dismantling them.
• TAKEAWAY: On average, thermal power units are operating fewer hours as non-fossil power sources increase;
but their total annual output has not declined since there are days when demand far exceeds forecasts.





METI highlights issues in EPRX market
(Denki Shimbun, July 24)
•  METI held a meeting indicating worsening supply-demand balance issues in the Electric Power
Reserve Exchange; it focused on the underbidding problem.
•  Measures such as reducing bid volumes have decreased shortages, but there is still a need to rely

on backup power.
•  METI plans to refine requirements for backup power and incentivize bids, particularly for facilities
that can be brought online quickly.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Govt proposes to end partial power supply scheme
(Government statement, July 24)
o  ANRE and the Japan Fair Trade Commission are soliciting public feedback on a plan to

end the “Partial Power Supply” scheme for independent service providers with limited
supply sources.
o  Feedback is accepted until Aug 22.
o  CONTEXT: The scheme began in 2013 to support small retailers hit by tight power
supplies following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.




TEPCO Power Grid faces highest demand of the summer

(Denki Shimbun, July 23)
•  On July 22, TEPCO Power Grid faced its highest demand of the summer, at 55 GW, due to a
heatwave.
•  Emergency measures improved reserve rates from 1.6% to over 8%, avoiding extra supply
directives.
•  Nationally, power demand hit a summer peak, highlighting the strain on the grid during high
temperatures.

12



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Hotter temperatures tend to lead to higher gas / LNG consumption in Japan, which
also pushes up power prices. The TEPCO coverage is especially reliant on gas-fired generation as
additional baseload as there are no nuclear power plants available at this moment.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
New power companies boost their share by 15.3%

(Denki Shimbun, July 23)
o  April’s electricity sales increased by 5% YoY, with new power companies boosting the
volume they sold by 15.3% in the same period.
o  Retail contracts were stable, with new power companies holding 17.5% of the market.
o  The largest growth was seen in special high-voltage and high-voltage categories.
o  Compared to the March power sales, however, April numbers for total electricity sold

were 10.8% lower.
• TAKEAWAY: The power retail market is in recovery mode after the tumultuous 2021/22 period that saw new
power companies (shin denryoku) lose market share, face financial difficulties, and the former regional utilities
take over many of the delivery contracts. At one point, new power entrants held about 22-23% of the market,
and while their share is lower today it again seems to be on an upward trajectory.




Discrepancy in regional reserve ratios causes issues in balancing market

(Denki Shimbun, July 26)
•  From April 2024, the use of regional reserve ratios for balancing has highlighted discrepancies
between weekly forecasts and actual supply-demand balances. The reasons are that some of the
calculations have to be done manually due to the data collection methods and also the
complicated nature of monitoring timely responses.
•  The quality of forecasts improves as actual demand time approaches, but weather-affected power

generation, such as solar, which now has over 10 GW of capacity in the Tokyo area alone, makes
exact forecasting difficult.
•  CONTEXT: Regional reserve ratios serve as a guideline for implementing additional supply
measures during demand crunches. Backup sources like pumped hydro, however, require more
accurate and timely directives to be utilized effectively. The risks of imbalance rise as the reserve
ratio drops to the ‘minimal’ 3% level.
•  The current display and interpretation of regional reserve ratios are problematic. Extremely low

figures in weekly forecasts may mislead the public, despite their utility to businesses. There is a
growing demand for improved accuracy and better communication of reserve ratios to prevent
misunderstandings.




METI's July 22-26 forecast shows critical supply-demand in Tokyo, Tohoku
(Denki Shimbun, July 22)
•  METI's forecast for July 22-26 showed critical supply-demand conditions in Tokyo and Tohoku.
•  The reserve margins dropped to 1.6% and 1.4%. Measures such as generator maintenance
rescheduling will likely maintain a stable supply.

13



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The discrepancy between weekly forecasts and actual supply-demand conditions is a
challenge for energy providers.




Tohoku Electric updates supply plan including for Higashi Niigata Unit 6
(Company statement, July 23)
•  Tohoku Electric updated its 2024 supply plan to include the development of Higashi-Niigata Unit
6. It made a bid in a recent decarbonization auction.
•  In March 2028, the utility will decommission Higashi-Niigata Units 1 and 2. The changes were

submitted to OCCTO.
•  CONTEXT: Unit 6 (capacity 650 MW) will be fueled by LNG, just like Units 1 and 2. But Tohoku
Electric will consider eventually switching to ammonia or hydrogen.




NRA chairman inspects Shimane NPP ahead of planned restart

•  NRA chairman Yamanaka inspected Shimane NPP that’s set to restart Unit 2 in December. L
•  Yamanaka confirmed that safety measures were nearly complete. He discussed the restart with

local governors and mayors.
•  Unit 2's restart, following new post-Fukushima safety standards, will be Chugoku Electric’s first.
Similar boiling water reactors (BWRs), like those at Fukushima, are also preparing for restarts, such
as Tohoku Electric’s Onagawa Unit 2 in November.
•  Shimane Pref Governor urged careful planning, not driven by schedules. The Chugoku Electric
president emphasized safety-first preparations.




NRA says Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 doesn’t meet new standards

(Nikkei, July 26)
•  The NRA said it cannot exclude the presence of an active fault beneath the No 2 reactor at Japan
Atomic Power Company's (JAPC) Tsuruga NPP in Fukui Pref.
•  This reactor has not met the new regulatory standards, preventing its restart.
•  CONTEXT: If confirmed, it will be the first time a plant has been disqualified in a review since the
NRA's founding.
•  The NRA will report its conclusion to Chairman Yamanaka and other commissioners July 31, and
then they’ll make a formal decision.

•  The NRA did not accept JAPC's repeated assertions that the fault is not active. JAPC had planned
to continue research but the NRA commissioner rejected further research, saying that after a year
of work it reached a final conclusion.
• TAKEAWAY: The debate over the fault under the Tsuruga plant has focused on two main issues. First, whether
the "K fault" about 300 meters north of the plant is active; the NRA concluded at the end of May that it’s

difficult to deny this. The second issue is whether the fissure extending from the fault to under the Unit 2
reactor should also be considered an active fault.
•  The background to these debates, however, is that the NRA halted the review of the Tsuruga plant

last year claiming that the operator numerously submitted documents that contained errors. The
regular claimed these were not just mistakes but also some instances of data tampering. The
situation was so bad that the NRA mulled forcing the operator to withdraw its restart application.
As such, there is perhaps little surprise that the regulator decided against accepting further
research from JAPC. For the operator, however, this will be a major blow, with the Tsuruga site
seen as a hub for new reactor developments in the future.




MHI gets KEPCO order to replace reactor internals in Takahama NPP

(Company statement, July 25)
•  MHI received an order from KEPCO to manufacture and replace two reactor internals for
Takahama NPP Units 1 and 2.
•  Reactor internals are crucial for holding fuel assemblies, and will be produced at Mitsubishi’s Kobe
Shipyard. The advanced designs will enhance long-term reliability and prevent bolt damage.
•  CONTEXT: KEPCO applied to the NRA for approval of the substitution plan. Similar work is
underway at Mihama NPP Unit 3. Replacement is required as a preventive measure.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
KEPCO applies for permit of in-vessel structures at Takahama NPP
(Company statement, July 25)
o  KEPCO applied to the NRA for approval of work at Takahama NPP to replace in-vessel
structures in Units 1 and 2.
o  Also, the utility plans to replace the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pumps of Units 1

to 4, as well as Unit 3 of the Mihama plant.
o  CONTEXT: Before the application, KEPCO notified Fukui Pref and Takahama Town on
May 28 seeking their understanding. On July 9 they obtained approval.

(Company statement, July 25)
•  Kyushu Electric applied to the NRA to revise the tsunami risk assessment for its Genkai NPP.
•  Kyushu Electric reassessed a potential tsunami impact based on the latest long-term evaluation of
active faults by the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion.

•  It confirmed that the revised evaluation won’t affect plant safety. There is no need for extra safety
measures.

• TAKEAWAY: Australia is attractive for Japanese companies active in CCS because its govt promotes policies to

develop the industry. Given Australia’s geological storage potential and its geography, more Japanese
companies will likely take part in CCS projects there, if more permits are granted.




Chiyoda consolidated net profit falls, hit by LNG project
(Nikkei, July 26)
•  Chiyoda Corp’s consolidated net profit for April-June fell 20%, YoY, to about ¥4 billion.
•  The drop is due to the bankruptcy of its U.S. JV partner, Zachry Industrial.

•  CONTEXT: Golden Pass LNG, one of the largest LNG projects in the U.S., faced significant hurdles
after Zachry filed for bankruptcy in May.
•  Chiyoda had set aside ¥37 billion for this project, which caused a net loss in FY2023.
• TAKEAWAY: Overall, Chiyoda’s financial performance showed resilience despite the challenges posed by
Zachry’s bankruptcy. This is due to diversification of Chiyoda’s project portfolios. Yet, future profitability relies
on solving issues surrounding Zachry's departure and, most of all, the LNG project's progress.

Hydrogen Hubs to Shine a Light on Japan’s ‘Green’ Future

Until recently, Japan’s hydrogen strategy has been largely colorblind. If anything,
there’s been more emphasis on ‘blue’ hydrogen projects due to the speed and scale
that they can deliver in comparison to most of the production plans linked to
renewable energy. However, this may change over time as the country’s regional
hydrogen hub strategy picks up pace.

Several green hydrogen production sites are expected to go onstream in Japan in the
middle of this decade, which adds some ‘craft’ supply for local economies, boosting
their sustainability levels. All ‘blue’ hydrogen in Japan is expected to be imported.

This analysis is Part 2 of our two-article series looking into major hydrogen projects in
the pipeline in Japan.

Yamanashi and Hokkaido, the green hydrogen hubs
Green hydrogen has been produced at a small scale of several hundred tons / year in
total since 2020 at:
•  FH2R plant in Fukushima Prefecture,
•  Obayashi geothermal plant in Oita,
•  Yamanashi Hydrogen Co (YHC) in Yamanashi.


Because of the higher costs of domestic green hydrogen projects, they were labeled
as dream / demo works with little or no market potential. The costs often cited for the
above projects were 100 times or more above the 2030 national goal of producing
hydrogen at ¥30 / NM3.

The FH2R facility, launched in time for the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020, enjoyed
positive feedback when it opened. But the cost of transport and failure to attract
industrial-scale users has made the FH2R uneconomic, operating more like a
demonstration center for the technology than a business.

Despite this, in 2025, several new green hydrogen productions are coming on-stream:
a 2,200 tons / year plant in the city of Hokuto, Yamanashi Prefecture; and a 10,000
tons / year plant in the city of Tomakomai, Hokkaido.

Municipal governments are driving the green hydrogen industry. They want to
monetize excess renewables electricity, which is made redundant due to a lack of
transmission cable bandwidth. From May to September, renewable operators in Japan
are often asked to curb output as too much solar power is generated.

The municipalities also learned from the Namie example that green hydrogen by itself
is not enough to attract end-users. They need to help set up workable means of
transporting the fuel and support the development of new hydrogen applications.

YHC, a joint venture between Yamanashi Prefecture, Toray and seven other
companies, has been a pioneer of not just green hydrogen production but also in
creating demand. On the production side, it conducts R&D of PEM electrolysis
technologies. On the demand side, it sells green hydrogen outside of Yamanashi’s
boundaries. It’s also developing off-grid application of H2 at local farms, as well as
exploring the potential for overseas sales.

The city of Sapporo in Hokkaido has unique plans, too. In June, it was awarded by the
Financial Services Agency a special business zone status to attract foreign investment
into clean energy. There will be new visa categories, support for opening bank
accounts, relaxing bank rules for financing startups, local tax cuts and subsidy offers,
and deregulation.

The Sapporo government seeks to attract operators of offshore wind turbine
installation ships from overseas by relaxing ship ownership rules. It aims to speed up
offshore wind projects along the Ishikari coast, and encourage green hydrogen
production. To drive up consumption, it plans to relax rules on hydrogen storage,
such as raising the storage volume limit.

The Hokkaido government decided to position Sapporo as the region’s clean energy
hub, because the city has the island’s largest population. Sapporo, Tomakomai and
Muroran comprise the core of the Hokkaido hydrogen supply chain, which is expected
to be set up by 2030. The area will not only produce hydrogen but will also act as a
demand center, with major local construction activity under way to build
semiconductor plants and data centers.

In the Tomakomai region 50 km south of Sapporo, a consortium led by Sparx will
bring onstream a new hydrogen production plant in January 2025. It will power
electrolysers with solar panels and industrial waste. Also in Tomakomai, Hokkaido
Electric, ENEOS and Idemitsu Kosan plan a 10,000 tons/ year green hydrogen plant.


In Chitose, which lies between Sapporo and Tomakomai, a consortium of Mitsubishi
Corp, Takasago Thermal Engineering, Hokkaido Electric and Air Water Hokkaido have
launched green hydrogen supply chain feasibility studies.

In May, the city of Muroran began a trial run of green hydrogen supply services, using
power from the 500 kW Shukutsu wind power station owned by the city. The aim is to
spread hydrogen use to homes and small customers by repurposing the wind station
without new capital investment into infrastructure, such as pipelines.

Supply chains are organic. They continue to grow. The Central Japan consortium
plans to build ammonia cracking and dehydrogenation facilities in the ports of
Nagoya and Mikawa, to convert ammonia to hydrogen and to supply FCV fueling
stations. They’re also developing the Yokkaichi Port as a backup, in case the JERA
Kinuura port closes due to emergencies.

Resonac plans a 100 MW hydrogen-fueled power plant. As its plastic recycling plant is
not capable of generating enough hydrogen, it will also import the fuel.

ENEOS is not limiting hydrogen opportunities to MCH. It is building another supply
chain on the Kawasaki waterfront area, consisting of liquid hydrogen, with Iwatani
Corp, Japan Suiso Energy and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The liquid hydrogen supply
chain consortium aims to hit the government hydrogen price target of ¥30 / NM3 in
2030.

Some say that the ultimate goal of the national hydrogen strategy is to run several
GW-size power plants fully fueled by hydrogen or ammonia, or both. The spread of

hydrogen via regional hubs could also see a kind of decentralization of power supply
structures.

Green hydrogen producers in Yamanashi and Hokkaido are developing off-grid
services for homes and farms, because it is more efficient to consume the energy
source close to home than to transport it to faraway demand centers. The Muroran
test is also off-grid. A wide variety of community-based suppliers may develop.

Conclusion: Everything hinges on METI subsidies
The bottom line is that neither super hydrogen power stations or supply diversity will
happen unless hydrogen costs fall to around the government target or less, or the
costs of incumbent energy sources rise due to carbon taxes or other factors.

For now, many advanced hydrogen projects exist thanks to subsidies from the
feasibility study phase. At what point will they be able to stand on their own
commercial feet?

There are already signs of a “decarbonization divide” between municipalities active in
climate issues and those limiting their scope to rooftop solar and energy saving
system installations. The latter are small municipalities, suffering from depopulation,
staff shortage and tight budgets.


Outsourcing of community services has become common and local authorities are
often happy to contract out the management of solar, FCV, EV and storage battery
programs to save their dwindling human resources. According to the government’s
Population Strategy Council, 40% of municipalities may cease to exist in 2050 due to
depopulation.

If the above scenario plays out, then there is only a certain time window during which
local authorities will be able to support new hydrogen supply chains and demos. After
that, only those municipalities with large populations and industrial centers will
continue. Meanwhile, the repurposing of existing facilities into cleaner alternatives will
become the zero emission driver, if it isn’t already.

Modernizing Port Infrastructure is Key to

Japan’s Wind Power Development
Japan has over 1,000 ports, yet when it came to selecting winners of the most recent
offshore wind auction, a decision on one of the four projects offered was delayed for
over three months due to concerns over port access. And this was only Round 2 of
national offshore wind tenders.

With ambitions of building 45 GW of offshore wind capacity in the next two decades,
Japan faces an unusual predicament. The country is well known for excellent
infrastructure and plenty of ports, but few can handle the logistics and transport
required to receive, store, and assemble wind farm components, as well as to support
the installation and maintenance of offshore wind facilities.

The success of multi-billion-dollar offshore wind power projects can hinge on the
availability of suitable port infrastructure. A port’s geographic proximity to an offshore
wind project, for example, is a key factor impacting overall costs and efficiencies. Ports
also determine the range and length of deployment of installation vessels, as well as
those used for operations and maintenance. Investors determine their interest in a
project partly based on port access.

As Japan’s offshore wind industry moves from tenders to the practicalities of
managing multi-hundred-MW projects, the government has heeded to industry calls
for a revamp of port facilities and began to assess the scale of modernizations, as well
as what it will take to allow Japanese ports to cope with today's larger vessels, wind
turbines, and other equipment.

Since these challenges are too complex for individual developers to solve, the
government is supporting public and private action, and corralling stakeholders for
sector-wide cooperation.


Improving port infrastructure
Japan's coastal geography and deep waters present challenges and opportunities for
offshore wind development. Traditionally, Japanese ports have been geared towards
supporting the fishing industry, trade, and fossil fuel imports. As a result, Japan has
some of the world’s most advanced LNG terminals, but the ports will require
significant upgrades to receive and then store 100-meter-long wind turbine towers
and blades, or 300-ton nacelles.

Upgrades require investment to improve function as a hub for manufacturing,
assembly, and maintenance of offshore wind components. For example, it takes
around three days to install just one turbine, depending on the distance between the
port and the project site.

As an island nation, Japan has many ports, totaling 1,020; but about 90% of these are
small. The total breaks down as: 22 special-purpose major ports, 106 standard major
ports, and 892 local ports.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Only a fraction of these, however, can be utilized to service the offshore wind industry,
and only a handful are currently doing so on a commercial basis. That’s despite the
fact that METI and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT)
have studied the port and harbor needs of offshore wind power generation facilities
since 2016.

Still, in recent years, there’s been some progress. In 2023, the government updated
the framework of the Port Improvement Promotion Act, pledging to support the
development of port facilities nationwide. This ensured funding for wharves and other
facilities at 70 ports nationwide.

With a budget of ¥79.8 billion for FY2023, the government has committed to funding
not only the land for wharves themselves, but also to the construction of sheds and
cranes, and the development of adjacent waterfront areas used for logistics.

As part of the wharf funding program, 62 ports were selected. These include ports
where offshore wind power generation projects are planned or under consideration:
Ishikari Bay New Port (Hokkaido); Akita Port, Noshiro Port (Akita Prefecture); Sakata
Port, Kashima Port (Ibaraki Prefecture); Niigata Port, Fushiki-Toyama Port (Toyama
Prefecture); Kitakyushu Port (Fukuoka Prefecture); and Nagasaki Port.

Japan currently has seven operational offshore wind farms, with three deemed large-
scale: the 112 MW Ishikari Bay New Port Wind farm; the 84 MW Noshiro Port; and the
54.6 MW Akita Port projects. Akita Port was put into commercial operation in January
2023 while Noshiro Port has been in commercial operation since December 2022.
Ishikari Bay consists of 14 wind turbines, each 8 MW; it began commercial operation
on January 1, 2024.

Base ports
The outsized parameters of offshore wind power components and foundations require
ports that can accommodate large vessels and have appropriate logistics facilities. To
kick-start the upgrade of domestic ports to work with the wind sector, the government
introduced a “base ports” program.


Such a port should have a pier that can handle heavy, large-scale materials and has
sufficient load-bearing capacity and space to handle the components needed for the
installation and maintenance of offshore wind power generation facilities. A base port
agrees to set aside its harbor and specific wharves for a time during the first stage of
wind farm construction.

In turn, project developers are asked by the government to state which port they plan
to use as their base port when tendering bids in the offshore wind auctions.

In 2022, eleven ports applied for the official status of an Offshore Wind Hub Port, and
two existing ports already designated as such expressed a wish for expansion.

The problem is, only seven locations passed the bar to receive the “base port”
designation. In April, the MLIT added Aomori and Sakata to a list that contains port
facilities in Kitakyushu, Niigata, Akita, Noshiro, and Kashima. And these ports have to

handle the eight sea areas already selected by
the government to move ahead with project
development.

What’s more, the ports selected to date are
aligned with existing projects and do not take
into account other areas that have significant
offshore wind potential. Perhaps the most
glaring omission is not having any port that can
service Hokkaido, the northern region with
Japan’s greatest offshore wind resources.

The port of Muroran, on the southern coast of
Hokkaido, is being promoted by an industry
group that includes Mitsubishi Steel Group as
another base port candidate. The Muroran
Offshore Wind Promotion Association (MOPA)
already counts 114 companies among its
members, including offshore wind developers,
and regularly hosts and supports wind sector
Source: MLIT                     forums and other events. But it has yet to
clinch the official base port designation.

Among the challenges faced by ports is that they’re already busy servicing other
industries. Muroran, for example, is key for Japan’s steel industry. Also, the ports are
often located in densely populated coastal areas, limiting the availability of space for
expansion. This makes it difficult to add things like specialized cranes, heavy-lift
equipment, and facilities for the assembly of large wind turbine components.

Nonetheless, unless new base ports are added, they are unlikely to play a role in
expanding the offshore wind project pipeline this decade. Due to the complex
regulatory frameworks around port infrastructure at both the national and level levels,
and the construction work itself, it takes about four years to upgrade the ports to fit
with sector requirements.


Most offshore wind projects in the pipeline are set to begin commercial operations in
2029 or 2030.

The next frontier
Despite the above efforts, ports may need to go through yet another round of
upgrades to accommodate floating wind power generation projects, the structures
and turbines of which have different parameters from fixed bottom turbines.

To avoid this becoming a bottleneck to the wind power sector’s development in the
future, the government is trying to get ahead of the issue.

In May, MLIT set up a new public-private forum to consider how floating wind power
structures will impact land-based facilities such as ports, as well as vessels. The forum’s
role is to get “various entities to work together to systematically design systems and


25

conduct technical reviews on a range of issues related to offshore construction, such
as the assembly and installation of floating bodies, and related ships.”

So far, the forum has held two meetings, and attracted a wide range of participants,
from oil major INPEX, to EDF Renewables, Tokyo University, and floating wind
promotion groups. Discussions have focused on measures that will update ports for
the assembly and storage of floating foundations and related structures.

The ministry expects the forum to bring industry wide solutions to fruition by around
the start of the next decade.

Meanwhile, in March, a public-private research hub for floating wind power was
created to act as a kind of clearing house for various sector designs and technologies.
The Floating Offshore Wind Technology Research Association [FLOWRA] seeks to
standardize the domestic infrastructure and supply chains, and members include most
of Japan’s major power utilities and large wind players like Mitsubishi Corp and
Marubeni.

With the government and many domestic players involved in the above discussions,
the development of floating offshore wind port infrastructure is expected to occur
faster and smoother. It should also help not only the ports, but also other supply chain
players such as those involved in vessel lease, charter, and operations.


Development of port infrastructure for offshore wind in Japan has had a slow start, but
with the appropriate action by the government and private sector stakeholders, it
should look significantly better towards the end of this decade.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Electricity market
The West Australian govt seeks bids for dispatchable capacity projects in its wholesale
electricity market. The tender aims to deliver 500 MW of 4-hour equivalent, or 2 GWh
of clean dispatchable capacity. This will help support the state’s energy system to
reach 82% renewables by 2030.

Australia / Natural gas
The govt is set to issue new offshore gas exploration permits to ensure a stable
energy supply and move away from coal-fired power facilities.

China / Solar power
Leading solar panel makers are setting up in the U.S. to take advantage of the
Inflation Reduction Act. These include Illuminate, a JV between Longi (China) and U.S.
energy developer Invenergy. Trina (China) is investing $200 million in a 5 GW solar
module plant in Texas. Jinko (China) opened a 400 MW panel factory in Florida in
2018.

India / Biomass
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy announced new financial incentives for
biomass pellet manufacturing in order to promote cleaner air quality and green
energy sources

India / Energy transition
The country aims to achieve 50% non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030. India’s
renewable energy capacity has reached 190 GW as of April, according to the
Economic Survey. This accounts for 43% of the nation’s total installed generation
capacity.

India / Rooftop solar
The Asian Development Bank approved a $240 million loan to boost rooftop solar
systems, helping India expand energy access and achieve its target of about 50% of
cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel energy sources by
2030.

Malaysia / CRESS
In September, the govt will launch the Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme
(CRESS) in order to facilitate open grid access, allowing third parties to supply or
purchase electricity through the grid system under agreed terms.

Philippines / Oil spill
A marine tanker carrying industrial fuel sank in rough seas, causing an oil spill that
could spread to waters off the capital Manila.

South Korea / EV batteries
LG Energy Solution is in talks with about three Chinese suppliers to produce low-cost
EV batteries for Europe, as competition is expected to intensify after the EU hit
Chinese-built EVs with extra tariffs.

Thailand / Hydrogen power
Saudi Arabia is considering investing in Thailand, particularly hydrogen energy.
Thailand’s Energy Minister was in Riyadh last week. Also, there is a proposal to extend
cooperation to the transfer of Saudi know-how and energy technology, and assistance
in establishing Thailand's strategic oil reserve infrastructure.
