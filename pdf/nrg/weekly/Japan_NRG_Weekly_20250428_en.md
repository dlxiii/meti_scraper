NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


Retailers to be allowed to use FIT certificates to sub for non-FIT, non-fossil certificates

(Government statement, April 23)
•  ANRE will allow retail electricity providers to use FIT certificates as a substitute for non-FIT, non-
fossil certificates to meet their obligations.
•  Demand exceeded supply in the most recent (3rd round) non-FIT, non-fossil certs auction, creating
a risk that retailers will be unable to meet assigned interim targets.
•  The price for substitute procurement will be set at ¥1.3/ kWh or higher, the same as the auction cap
for non-FIT certs.
•  CONTEXT: Of the annual amount of non-FIT certificates issued by power generators (111.8 TWh),
almost all have already been allocated, with only about 400 GWh remaining. ANRE estimates that
about 80 TWh of FIT certificates remain unsold, and even after deducting the amount to be purchased
externally, the impact will be limited.
• TAKEAWAY: Retail electricity suppliers are required to boost their proportion of electricity from non-fossil fuel
sources to 44% or more by 2030. But, this is difficult to achieve for small and medium-sized businesses that rely
on the wholesale power market, so they rely on the purchase of non-fossil certificates to meet quotas. Data
centers and real estate developers are other players that consume a large portion of certs. This elevated demand
leads to shortages in the certs pools. FIT-related certs represent the bigger portion in the market. However, the
renewables sector is shifting from FIT to FIP and other models, while there are also non-fossil certs that
represent non-FIT power sources like nuclear.



Govt launches working group for Watt-Bit Coordination
(Government statement, April 21)
•  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) and METI launched a working group to
promote integrated development of power infrastructure and data centers, known as the "Watt-Bit
Coordination."
•  The working group includes representatives from major power and telecom companies, including

Tokyo Electric Power Grid, NTT, SoftBank, and KDDI.
•  Professor Ezaki Hiroshi of the University of Tokyo chairs the group.
•  Due to the concentration of data center connection requests in specific regions, the group called to
focus efforts on improving the efficient use of existing power grids in the short term — placing data
centers in areas with spare grid capacity.
•  In the short to mid-term (by 2030), the goal is to develop data center sites that rely on existing
grids; in the long term, to expand power and telecom infrastructure.



ANRE announces significant updates for 3rd round LTDA
(Government statement, April 23)
•  ANRE announced significant updates for the third round of the Long-Term Decarbonization Power
Source Auction (LTDA) in FY2025.
•  The goal is to encourage investment in new power sources by addressing rising construction costs
due to inflation, interest rate hikes, and currency depreciation.
•  Key updates are:

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Adjusted business return rates: The standard business return rate of 5% will be modified
based on the construction period.
o  Increased bid price cap: The maximum bid price was doubled from ¥100,000/ kW to
¥200,000/ kW to reflect increased construction costs.
o  Higher price cap for emerging technologies: The maximum price for hydrogen, ammonia,
and thermal power with CCS will be raised.
•  CONTEXT: The LTDA bidding system, which aims to promote new investment in decarbonized power
sources, was conducted twice since FY2023. The winner of the second auction hasn’t been determined,
but a detailed plan for the third auction is underway, reflecting the new 7th Basic Energy Plan.



Idemitsu partners with Toyota to shift from oil to decarbonized energy
(Nikkei, April 22)
•  Idemitsu is partnering with Toyota to drive its shift from oil to decarbonized energy. Key efforts
include developing solid electrolytes for next-gen EV batteries and building a synthetic gasoline
supply chain using green hydrogen and CO2.
•  Mass production of battery materials is planned by 2027–2028, with synthetic fuel deliveries to
Toyota starting around 2026.
•  While cautious about renewables, Idemitsu is investing heavily in four focus areas: solid electrolytes,
ammonia, synthetic methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.
•  The company aims to invest ¥800 billion by 2030 to lead Japan’s energy transition.



Denso begins fuel cell power utilization demo

(Company statement, April 22)
•  Auto components manufacturer Denso began a demo project using its proprietary solid oxide fuel
cell (SOFC) system at a public facility in Okazaki City, Aichi Pref.
•  The system supplies power and, in collaboration with Chubu Electric Miraiz, feeds surplus electricity
back to the grid at night when excess power is generated.
•  SOFC is a fuel cell using ceramic in the core part called “cell stack”, which generates electricity and
heat using oxygen in the air and hydrogen reformed from gas.
•  CONTEXT: The project is part of an initiative sponsored by NEDO and aims to expand the use of fuel
cells through industry-academia-govt collaboration.



Kyuden forms alliance with German startup
(Company statement, April 24)
•  Kyuden International, a subsidiary of Kyushu Electric, invested in German startup LiveEO, which
uses AI to analyze satellite data. The data is used for infrastructure inspection, such as power lines
and railways.
•  The investment was made through a fund Kyuden joined in 2023.

NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


OCCTO  forecasts electricity supply-demand outlook for 2040, 2050 by source
(Agency statement, April 18)
•  OCCTO announced Japan's electricity supply-demand outlook for 2040 and 2050 including nuclear,
renewables, pumped storage, and battery storage.
•  The conclusions are based on studies from the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the
Earth (RITE) and Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting.
•  It assumes an increase in electricity demand due to factors like new data centers, and a significant
expansion of renewables.

•  Nuclear power is expected to contribute 23–37 GW, factoring in long-term operation and
replacement of older plants.
•  Renewable energy capacity could reach up to 260 GW by 2050. Solar power is expected to continue
to play a major role.
•  Supply-demand balance during spring and autumn daytime hours was also considered, noting that
surplus power could be managed with pumped storage and batteries.
•  CONTEXT: At the previous meeting in February, OCCTO created a model case for demand that took
into account uncertainties and other factors, presenting two cases for electricity demand in 2040 (900
and 1,100 TWh), and four cases for 2050 (950, 1,050, 1,150, and 1,250 TWh).



EEX records 119% growth in Japanese electricity futures
(Exchange statement, April 23)
•  The European Energy Exchange saw trading in Japanese electricity derivatives jump 119% to 35.7
TWh in Q1, compared to 16.3 TWh a year earlier.
•  March recorded 13.6 TWh of electricity trades via futures and options contracts, a monthly record.
Last year’s total was 72.9 TWh.
•  Earlier this month, EEX launched a central limit order book for the Japanese market, allowing
electronic access to real-time prices and liquidity, boosting trading.
•  The exchange received the first orders for the book on the day of launch (April 22), and the first
trade concluded was related to a Tokyo-based Month Future.

JEPX spot market rebuilds volumes after end of gross bidding
(Japan NRG, Exchange data, April 25)
•  The average Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) daily spot market trading in March was up 20%
YoY to 781.7 GWh, as trading volumes continue to recover from October 2023 when the practice of
gross bidding ended.
•  There’s been an upward trend in spot trading volumes over the last 18 months and the average daily
totals grew in the five months before March, until early spring brought warmer-than-usual
temperatures.
•  The March total trading volume was up both YoY (+20%) and MoM (+4.0%) to 24.23 TWh. This
accounted for 33.7% of total nationwide electricity demand.
•  The average 24-hour system price dropped ¥2.63 from February to ¥11.31/ kWh, with daytime and
peak averages falling similarly. It’s set to average closer to ¥10 in April.

• TAKEAWAY: As impressive as the March 2025 numbers are, the daily trading volumes are still 6% below same-
month 2023 levels and 8% less than in 2022. Volumes are rebuilding after the suspension of gross bidding by
the EPCOs in late 2023. Gross bidding, introduced in 2017, forced the generation divisions of EPCO holdings to
sell power at marginal cost on the JEPX – with the holding’s own retail arms usually buying it back. The idea
was to boost JEPX liquidity and reduce price volatility. Gross bidding accounted for 6% of Japan’s total physical
power at one point and 15% of JEPX’s traded volumes, but it had little impact on allowing equal access for new
market entrants to wholesale electricity; so, the regulator, EGC, recommended phasing it out. All EPCOs
suspended gross bidding effective October 1, 2023. The gradual recovery in volumes is important for improved
price discovery. It also indicates natural market growth, partly led by the expansion of market participants,
greater reliance on the spot market by power generators, and overall power demand growth.

ANRE announces additional auction for capacity market
(Government statement, April 23)
•  ANRE will hold an additional auction for the capacity market in FY2025 (actual supply-demand in
FY2026).
•  This decision comes as power supply is expected to fall short by about 5 GW due to increased
procurement targets and a number of power sources exiting the market.
•  This will be the second consecutive year such an auction is held; bidding is set to begin in early
June.
•  OCCTO presented a draft demand curve showing the new target is about 187 GW, an increase of 8.5
GW (4.8%) from the previous main auction in 2022. However, only 181.6 GW is currently secured,
leaving a shortfall.
•  Bidding is scheduled for June 4. Results to be announced in late July.

•  CONTEXT: The additional auction is used by OCCTO to adjust the amount of secured capacity for
future periods. This auction is usually held one year before the supply year to account for updated
forecasts of electricity demand, changes in generation capacity, or other developments not foreseen
during the main auction.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
OCCTO begins comprehensive verification of capacity market
(Agency statement, April 23)
o  OCCTO began a comprehensive review of the capacity market, which will assess whether
the system has been functioning properly based on the results of past auctions, and will
identify areas for improvement.
o  Findings are expected to be compiled by late FY2025. Topics include investment
predictability, penalties, financial requirements, and policy issues like inefficient coal
power. Long-term decarbonization auctions won’t be reviewed.
o  Improvements will be applied starting with the FY2026 auction for FY2030 supply.
o  CONTENTS: The capacity market system has held five main auctions to date and completed
one full cycle of actual supply and demand in FY2024.



ANRE, OCCTO clarify plans for simultaneous market
(Government statement, April 22)
•  ANRE and OCCTO updated plans for a simultaneous market, in which electricity supply (kWh) and
balancing capacity (Δ (delta) kW) are traded together.
•  After deliberating whether to obligate self-scheduled generation to bid in the future simultaneous
market system, planners decided it won’t be necessary – provided that power plant operators meet
transparency measures, such as registering generation information.
•  CONTEXT: Self-scheduled generation refers to power plants where operators can determine whether to
start up or switch off facilities themselves, as opposed to following grid operator instructions.
•  Officials decided that the new system should impose restrictions on self-scheduled power sources
only when necessary, such as when renewable output control or balancing shortages can’t be
avoided. In such cases, power allocation will follow a merit order (ie. ranking generation facilities
based on price, etc.) instead of giving priority to self-scheduled power sources.

•  Other updates:
o  Retailers will register desired quantities and prices by area and time slot, but quantity-only
bids will also be allowed.
o  There’ll be location-specific bidding for certain large-scale power consumers, including
pumped hydro storage, economic dispatch for large thermal plants, and highly variable
loads like data centers.

• TAKEAWAY: The simultaneous market discussions are accelerating, as noted in the Analysis section of the
March 31, 2025 issue of Japan NRG. There are still many complex issues to work through, many technical and
financial. Contrary to media reports, METI says it’s not under pressure to complete discussions by a particular
time frame. Still, it’s expected that the system configurations may be defined in the next year or two.



TEPCO EP considers lowering basic charge for extra-high and high-voltage plans
(Denki Shimbun, April 25)
•  TEPCO Energy Partner might lower basic charges for some standard rate plans offered to high-
voltage and above customers. The focus is on plans with about 30% exposure to wholesale market
price fluctuations, with rate revisions planned for FY2026.
•  In addition to enhancing the competitiveness of rate plans based on customer demands, TEPCO EP
aims to strengthen proposals for carbon-neutral solutions. This aims to create a rate structure that
benefits customers who level out power loads, reduce contracted power, and use electricity
efficiently.
•  CONTEXT: Since FY2024, TEPCO EP has offered standard high-voltage and above plans with wholesale
market exposure levels of 0%, 30%, and 100%. For the 0% and 30% plans, TEPCO EP announced that
starting in FY2025, basic charges would increase by about ¥1,000/ kWh of contracted power, bringing
the total to around ¥3,000, while lowering the per-unit energy charges.

• TAKEAWAY: In the Tokyo metropolitan area, competition for corporate power contracts is intensifying. New
power retailers are gaining ground, capitalizing on falling wholesale market prices, and there are also reports of
major utilities from other regions “crossing borders” into the market. TEPCO EP needs to offer more diverse
solutions to retain its market dominance.

Energy consumption and CO2 emissions drop amid shift to renewables
(Government statement, April 25)
•  ANRE released final figures for Japan’s energy supply and demand in FY2023.
•  Final energy consumption decreased 2.7% compared to the previous year. Petroleum consumption
dropped 3%, city gas 2.5%, electricity 2.5%, and coal 2.2%.
•  Primary energy supply also shrank, down 4% from FY2022. Fossil fuel supply experienced a
significant 7% reduction. Coal decreased by 8.7%, natural gas and city gas by 7.9%, and oil by
5.2%.
•  Non-fossil fuel supply rose by 11.1%. This was due to a 51.7% increase in nuclear power and a 6.3%
rise in renewable energy (excluding hydro). Renewable energy, including hydro, increased and
reached a 19.3% share of total energy supply. This is the highest in 25 years.
•  Electricity generation totaled 987.7 TWh, the lowest level since FY2010. The share of non-fossil fuel
electricity sources exceeded 30% for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, reaching
31.4%. The generation mix consisted of 22.9% from renewable energy, 8.5% from nuclear, and
68.6% from thermal (excluding biomass).

Pink Prospects: Why Japan’s Hydrogen Future Glows Nuclear
Japan has painted its development of a clean hydrogen society as largely moving from
‘gray’ fuel (the production of which releases emissions) to ‘blue’ (which seeks to
capture/ store those emissions) and to ‘green’ (no/ low emissions during electrolysis
powered by renewables).

Yet, while ‘green’ hydrogen is often heralded as the sustainable choice, ‘pink’ should be
the color of Japan’s clean energy future (2040-beyond) if produced based on a partial
circular economy approach. ‘Pink’ hydrogen is produced by nuclear-powered electrolysis.
While the country seeks to raise the share of electricity in the mix from renewable
sources, nearly 20 GW of nuclear capacity remains unused due to roadblocks in the
regulatory or local government processes.
Restarting this capacity — and adding new nuclear facilities tailored for hydrogen
production – could offer a practical and economic way to create domestic hydrogen
supply without diverting Japan’s scant renewable resources from the power grid.

Japan’s energy dilemma is acute as it imports nearly 97% of its primary energy, relying
heavily on LNG and oil shipments, making its primary energy self-sufficiency ratio
critically low. Nuclear energy, curtailed post-Fukushima, is being rehabilitated, but the
domestic fleet of reactors is aging. The cost of building new reactors makes it difficult to
see how they will compete in a liberalized electricity market without certain state
support.
According to my research, over the past year using numerous Japanese and global
sources and interviews, promoting nuclear as one of the primary power sources for
domestic hydrogen production would hit several goals – cost, stability, energy security,
and industrial competitiveness. This special column for Japan NRG, based on my thesis
submitted to Johns Hopkins University late last year, outlines some of these arguments.

Methodology
Given Japan’s energy and environmental situations, my research sought to explore the
best reasonable, practical, and economic future (2040-beyond) source of clean hydrogen
for Japan if produced based on a partial circular economy approach. There is a gap in
the data and information required for a complete cost-comparative analysis. However,
below are a few considerations that could guide policy and business reviews.
During the 2024 Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition, I presented my “Begin at the
Beginning” strategy, which builds on my nexus-integrated policies that emphasized
domestic clean hydrogen production and its integration with high priority, heavy
industry of Japan.

This strategy centers on sustainable hydrogen production from domestic green or pink
hydrogen hubs strategically co-located with existing and future wastewater treatment
plants. Given the projected decline in freshwater availability, wastewater represents an
untapped, renewable, and virtually infinite energy resource.
This analysis draws inspiration from Japan's mottainai movement (reduce, reuse,
recycle, respect) and leverages three theoretical frameworks to guide data selection and
comparative analysis of green and pink hydrogen production, based on a partial circular
economy approach. My previously developed proprietary qualitative frameworks for
the hydrogen sector, including concepts such as the quasi-revolutionary transition for
U.S. coastal green hydrogen hubs and nexus-integrated policies for Japan, underpin the
methodology.

Additionally, the analysis employs the technical cycle outlined in the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation's circular economy diagram to structure comparative assessments. The
circular economy model adheres to three core principles: eliminating waste and
pollution, circulating materials and products at their highest value, and regenerating
nature. It operates through two cycles – biological and technical – that address both
material production and consumption alongside sustainable natural resource
management.

Innovation
One reason for Japan not to limit its domestic hydrogen program to 'green' sources is
that the volume of renewables that can be connected to electrolyzers without diverting
power from direct electricity users is small. Japan's current generation of 'green'
hydrogen projects does not exceed 10 MW of capacity. That scale cannot meet even a
fraction of Japan's stated goals of growing hydrogen consumption from 2 million tons a
year today to 3 million tons in 2030, 12 million tons in 2040, and 20 million tons in
2050.
Luckily, scarcity of resources has catalyzed Japan's R&D. From 2011 to 2020, the
country emerged as a top innovator, accounting for 24% of clean hydrogen-related
international patent families (IPFs).

Japanese Patents in the Clean Hydrogen Sectors


























Source: Hydrogen Patents for a Clean Energy Future by IEA (2024).

During the last decade, Japanese clean hydrogen patenting grew faster than in the
European Union, with a compound average growth rate of 6.2% versus 4.5%,
respectively. In September 2024, the Japan Hydrogen Fund was set up as the first
Japanese fund dedicated to developing low-carbon hydrogen. With $400 million from
various investors, it seeks to propel some of these innovations to the next level.

Run rates
Another reason to consider nuclear as an alternative to renewables for hydrogen
production is the energy efficiency rates of the technologies. Capacity factors, a crucial

22

reliability indicator, reveal a stark contrast: nuclear reactors typically achieve upwards of
90%, compared to wind and solar in Japan, which fluctuate between 25% and 33%.

This reliability dramatically lowers operational costs. For instance, in 2023, Japanese
nuclear energy achieved a capacity factor of 28%, still below optimal levels but
significantly higher than solar’s 17.2% and wind’s 25.4% capacity factors projected for
2030.
With the restart of more reactors, METI expects the capacity factor of nuclear plants in
Japan to reach 70% by 2030.

Lowering grid capex?
The financial advantages of utilizing existing nuclear infrastructure are considerable.
Restarting existing reactors and prolonging their operational life can cost between $700
million and $1 billion per reactor, significantly cheaper than constructing new
renewable infrastructure. Conversely, expanding solar and wind generation requires
significant investment in transmission lines, battery storage, and other grid
enhancements.
For instance, TEPCO recently announced a $3.2 billion upgrade of its power grid
specifically to support increased renewable energy integration. While grid upgrades are
vital for the country to move toward CO2-free electricity in general, the transmission
capex nationwide should be lower, with ‘pink’ hydrogen contributing to the energy mix.

Tests of pink hydrogen
Successful tests of Japan’s home-grown high-temperature engineering test reactor
(HTTR) during the 2000s and last year showcase the potential to utilize this technology
to support hydrogen production. The HTTR program has now applied for a permit to
connect it with a hydrogen system to begin pilot-scale production from 2030.
However, early efforts to make ‘pink’ hydrogen are already underway. Kansai Electric
conducted a six-month demonstration (October 2023 to March 2024) that sent about
27.7 MWh of nuclear-derived electricity to a hydrogen system in Tsuruga City. This
experiment resulted in a total manufacturing of about 1,570 Nm³ (roughly 140 kg) of
hydrogen. Around 990 Nm³ (88 kg) of this hydrogen was utilized within the nuclear
plants as fuel for cooling generators and other devices, and about 580 Nm³ (52 kg) was
allocated to fuel cell vehicles.

In November 2024, Kansai Electric said that it will use the same approach to
manufacture ‘pink’ hydrogen for use in fuel cell ships at the Osaka-Kansai World Expo in
Osaka, which started on April 13, and to source hydrogen fuel for co-firing at the Himeji
No. 2 Thermal Power Plant. The co-firing tests are due to start this fiscal year.

Environmental impact
From an environmental standpoint, nuclear energy exhibits significantly lower lifecycle
GHG emissions, approximately 6 tons of CO2 per GWh, compared to 8-83 tons for solar
power and around 11 tons for wind.
Land use – a critical issue in densely populated Japan – also highlights nuclear
advantages. Salvaging existing infrastructure is an important consideration for building
both green and pink H2 hubs located next to existing and future water wastewater
treatment plants.

Small modular reactors (SMRs), touted as next-generation nuclear technology, also
occupy significantly smaller land footprints than extensive solar or wind farms,
minimizing ecological disruptions and land acquisition issues.

Conclusion
In summary, Japan's energy insecurity, limited land resources, existing nuclear
infrastructure, and ambitious climate targets make pink hydrogen not only merely
attractive but strategically indispensable.
Nuclear-powered hydrogen production, utilizing a partial circular economy approach,
emerges as an economically compelling, practically feasible, and environmentally sound
choice based on the chance for innovation, favorable capacity factors, financial
advantages and a positive environmental impact. Based on this, pink hydrogen should at
the very least complement its green cousin – and, it may even exceed it.

Battery Makers Drive Breakthroughs as
Energy Storage is Crucial for Grid Stability

As the grid gets smarter and the demand for clean energy surges, Japan is racing to
ensure the power stays on — even when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t
blowing. Battery storage, once a backstage player, is now a critical piece of the country's
energy puzzle.

Ask a Tokyo energy planner what tops their agenda and they’ll often list building out the
energy storage sector. That’s a national priority, with Japan setting ambitious targets to
expand renewable energy sources like solar and offshore wind, and to reduce
dependence on fossil fuels. However, the intermittent nature of certain renewables
demands scalable storage solutions to stabilize the grid, making battery innovation more
important than ever.
Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) have long dominated energy storage, but their heavy
reliance on materials like lithium and cobalt — sometimes sourced through fragile and
ethically questionable supply chains — poses a risk to Japan’s energy security and
sustainability.

There’s also the competition with China to consider, whose battery makers are linked in
supply chains that stretch right to the source of the raw minerals, helping them lower
costs.
Still, Japan’s top battery makers feel that racing to secure their own mines or supply
chains in Africa and elsewhere is not the only way to compete. There is faith in new
technology breakthroughs that could flip the script on resource demand.

Technology Shift: Beyond Lithium-Ion
Japan’s battery sector is growing rapidly. In 2023, battery shipments surged by 125%
year-on-year, fueled by demand across residential, commercial, and grid-scale markets.
Yet, vulnerabilities in lithium supply chains — largely dominated by China — have
exposed the need for alternative technologies.
The government is reinforcing these industrial efforts with strong policy support.
Batteries have been designated as critical materials under the Economic Security
Promotion Act, and ¥40 billion (roughly $260 million) has been earmarked in FY2024 to
support grid-connected storage deployment through the energy transition bond
program.

In parallel, Japan is rolling out a battery industry strategy aimed at securing domestic
manufacturing capabilities for lithium-ion batteries. These plans center around
accelerating the development of next-generation batteries such as the following:
- Sodium-ion batteries (SiBs), which use abundant, low-cost materials like sodium
and eliminate the need for cobalt, offering greater thermal stability and
sustainability;
- Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) and sodium-sulfur (NaS) batteries, which
show strong potential for grid-scale, long-duration energy storage.

Companies such as NGK Insulators, Sumitomo Electric, and Toyota are spearheading
advances in alternative chemistries, supported by government programs and
international partnerships. These public-sector efforts are catalyzing private innovation,
helping to scale production and strengthen domestic battery supply chains.

In the words of one domestic battery manufacturer, “we hope to extend the availability
of renewables electricity to the 5pm to 9pm period.” Without this longer availability of
‘green’ power on a daily basis, it’s hard to justify major new investments in solar capacity
because of the growing trend for curtailments, the manufacturer said.
Regular consumer support for decarbonized electricity would also expand if renewables
could cover the late afternoon demand peak, according to the manufacturer.

Solid-state batteries as the next frontier
As tech advancements continue, solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are drawing attention as
the next major leap in energy storage technology, promising to overcome many of the
limitations of conventional Li-ion batteries. By replacing the liquid electrolyte with a
solid material, they offer the potential for significantly higher energy density, faster
charging times, enhanced safety, and longer lifespans.
Japan is heavily invested in solid-state battery technology to reclaim its leadership in
battery innovation, having pioneered Li-ion batteries in the 1990s. Major automotive
players like Toyota, Honda, and Nissan see SSBs as essential for the next generation of
EVs, offering faster charging and longer range. Japan’s reliance on imported energy
means that high-performance batteries are also crucial for enhancing energy security
and supporting renewable energy integration.

The government is backing this push through significant R&D funding and initiatives
like the Green Innovation Fund, aiming for commercialization by 2030. Facing intense
global competition, Japan views the rapid development of SSBs as critical, with
companies like Toyota showcasing prototypes, startups like ProLogium entering the
scene, and materials giants such as Sumitomo Chemical and Murata building the supply
chain.

Leading developments in this area include:
- Toyota aims to commercialize solid-state batteries for hybrid vehicles by 2027–2028
and is collaborating with Idemitsu Kosan to develop advanced sulfide-based
electrolytes;
- Honda built a demonstration facility in Sakura City, preparing for mass production
of solid-state batteries in the late 2020s;
- Nissan plans to mass-produce all-solid-state batteries by early 2029, focusing on
faster charging, lower costs, and greater safety;
- SoftBank and Enpower Japan have achieved a specific energy of 350 Wh/ kg with
their all-solid-state battery, initially targeting drones and HAPS, with future
automotive applications in sight.
While challenges such as scaling production and ensuring long-term stability remain,
solid-state batteries could offer dramatically higher energy density, faster charging, and
improved safety compared to current technologies.

Government support: boosting domestic capacity
Recognizing the strategic importance of energy storage, METI has launched major
subsidy programs for grid-connected batteries, residential storage systems, and EV
battery production.
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government also announced generous funding initiatives
starting in fiscal 2025, targeting projects over 1 MW to enhance grid resilience. Japan
has recently introduced several government subsidies and programs to bolster battery
energy storage across various sectors. Here's an overview of the key initiatives:

▪ In late 2024, METI awarded ¥34.6 billion in subsidies to 27 grid-scale battery
energy storage system (BESS) projects. These subsidies cover between one-third and
two-thirds of equipment and construction costs, depending on the technology.
Eligible projects are 1 MW or larger and can span up to three fiscal years. Notable
recipients include Eurus Energy, Terras Energy, and Toyota Tsusho.
▪ Another program is Home & Commercial Energy Storage. In July 2024, the
Japanese government allocated ¥9 billion to support the introduction of energy
storage systems for home, commercial, and industrial use. Nine energy aggregators
were selected to facilitate this program. Subsidies cover up to one-third of capital
expenditure, with a maximum of ¥300 million per commercial and industrial
project. The majority of the funding is directed toward the residential system.

▪ In September 2024, METI approved up to ¥347.9 billion in subsidies for 12 projects
aimed at enhancing Japan's electric vehicle (EV) battery production capacity. This
initiative is part of a broader strategy to achieve 150 GWh/ year of domestic battery
production by 2030. The subsidies cover various aspects, including Li-ion battery
cell production, raw material production, and manufacturing equipment.
Long-duration and grid-scale storage solutions
To strengthen grid resilience and provide stable, long-duration energy storage, Japanese
companies are deploying large-scale storage systems, such as one by Sumitomo Electric,
which installed a 1 MW × 8-hour VRFB system in Kashiwazaki City, with a second unit
expected by spring 2025.

NGK Insulators introduced the NAS MODEL L24 battery, featuring improved durability
and lower annual degradation. Eku Energy is also constructing the Hirohara Battery
Energy Storage System (BESS) in Miyazaki City, a 120 MWh project set to serve some
63,000 households for four hours starting in 2026.

Battery innovation is also advancing in the residential and commercial sectors. For
instance, Kyocera, in collaboration with 24M Technologies, a U.S.-based firm engaged in
R&D of batteries for energy storage, commercialized a semi-solid Li-ion battery cell,
offering safer, more cost-effective energy storage for homes.
Early signs indicate the investments are paying off. In October 2024, Panasonic reported
a 42% rise in energy unit operating profit for Q2, driven by growing demand for storage
systems in data centers. Despite a decline in profit from the in-vehicle business,
operating income for the key segment, which makes batteries for Tesla, and other
automakers, rose to ¥32.7 billion last year.

Background: ethical and environmental drivers
Japan’s pivot to alternative battery technologies is also shaped by environmental and
ethical concerns.

There is growing awareness in Japan among experts and organizations about the ethical
and environmental problems tied to battery material sourcing, particularly related to
mining impacts and human rights. Some groups stress the need for more sustainable
resource extraction, while others call for Japan to develop its own alternative resource
bases to reduce dependency on problematic global supply chains.
For instance, extracting lithium from salt flats in Argentina and Chile consumes vast
amounts of water in already arid regions, while producing battery-grade lithium in
China and Australia demands high energy use. Current practices strain ecosystems.

On top of that, mining of lithium and cobalt has been linked to significant ecological
damage and human rights violations, particularly in South America and the Democratic
Republic of Congo. The issue has been raised in Japan by political scientist Mutsuji
Shoji, who warns that while the spread of EVs promotes decarbonization, it also risks
overlooking these human rights abuses, such as child labor, associated with cobalt
mining in the DRC.
As an example, sodium-ion batteries propose a cleaner, more ethical alternative that will
help reduce reliance on geopolitically sensitive regions. There are also advances in
sustainable material science, such as biomass-based anodes and machine learning-
designed electrodes.

Another solution, backed by the Japan Project-Industry Council (JAPIC), which
promotes domestic resource utilization, is development of deep-sea resources,
specifically cobalt-rich crusts within Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). They
propose manufacturing mining test equipment by fiscal year 2025 and beginning real-
sea excavation tests by 2027, urging both the government and private sector to
cooperate closely.
Deep-sea mining, however, also faces a pushback by environmental groups and some
global manufacturers.

Building a resilient energy future
Amid soaring electricity demand and the rapid growth of renewables, battery storage is
becoming the cornerstone of Japan’s energy transition.

Thanks to breakthroughs in sodium-ion, vanadium flow, and solid-state technologies,
and supported by aggressive government programs, Japan is positioning itself as a
global leader in next-generation energy storage.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Elections
‘Australian Gas for Australians’ – Energy takes the main stage in the country’s elections. The
soaring cost of electricity is the focus of debates ahead of May’s vote. Peter Dutton, the
rightwing leader of the opposition Liberal party, threw his weight behind nuclear power to
undermine the Labor government’s “reckless” policies on renewable energy.
China / Renewable energy
Shanghai Electric agreed with Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) and Oman’s
Mawarid Group for major renewable energy projects across both Middle Eastern nations. The
partnerships will focus on advancing clean energy through technology deployment, localized
manufacturing, and multi-sector collaboration. The agreement with Masdar involves the
development of a 2GW solar power project in Saudi Arabia.
India / Pumped hydro
Adani Green Energy signed a 40-year PPA for 1.25 GW pumped hydro in Uttar Pradesh, which
is India’s most populous state with around 240 million inhabitants.

India / Wind power
NTPC Green Energy awarded a contract to Suzlon involving a 378 MW wind energy project.
Following this development, the two companies are now working on projects that will generate
a total of 1.54 GW of wind power.

Indonesia / Gas power
Indonesia should cut gas subsidies and enforce carbon pricing mechanisms to enhance the
viability of green hydrogen for domestic industries, according to the Institute for Essential
Services Reform. Indonesia identified 17 potential sites for green hydrogen production.
However, the subsidized gas price of $6 per MMBTU for seven industrial sectors poses a
challenge to the competitiveness of green hydrogen.
LPG markets
China’s pivot away from U.S. liquefied petroleum gas under new tariffs is shaking global energy
flows, slashing demand, and fuelling a scramble for alternatives across Asia, with Middle
Eastern suppliers and rival buyers seizing the moment. The tariff move, effective May 14, is the
latest blow in a widening trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.
Philippines/ Gas power
At the request of the Philippine Stock Exchange, ENEX Energy Corp confirmed it is still keen on
developing a 1.1 GW gas plant in Batangas.

Southeast Asia / Solar panels
The U.S. announced new tariffs, targeting companies in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and
Vietnam, after an investigation begun a year ago when American manufacturers of solar panels
accused Chinese companies of flooding the market with subsidized, cheap goods made in SE
Asia. Products from Cambodia would face the highest tariffs, of 3,521%, because its companies
did not cooperate with the U.S. investigation; products made in Malaysia by the Chinese
manufacturer Jinko Solar face duties of just over 41%; rival Trina Solar’s products from
Thailand will incur tariffs of 375%.

Vietnam / Solar and BESS
The Ministry of Industry and Trade announced a new round of feed-in tariffs (FIT) for solar
power, introducing location-based pricing and, for the first time, incorporating energy storage
systems. The updated scheme highlights the growing importance of storage in stabilizing the
grid and enhancing energy autonomy.
Wind Power
Over 900 GW of wind power capacity is forecasted to be installed from 2025 to 2030, said the
Global Wind Energy Council. It expects a compound average growth rate of 8.8%, which means
another 981 GW of wind energy capacity globally by 2030. A total of 117 GW of wind energy
was installed in 2024, with China leading with 80 GW.
