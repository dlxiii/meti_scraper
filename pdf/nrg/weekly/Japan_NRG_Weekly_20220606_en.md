Upper House elections slated for June 22
(Nikkei, June 4)
•  LDP Secretary General Mogi stated that the summer Upper House election "will definitely be
announced on June 22. The election is expected to be held on July 10. This schedule assumes that
the current Diet session, which ends on June 15, will not be extended.”
•  The election period would normally last 17 days, with the public announcement on June 23, but

since it coincides with the "Memorial Day in Okinawa," it is expected to be moved up one day.



METI minister unveils clean energy strategy overview
(Japan NRG, May 31)
•  METI minister Hagiuda unveiled an overview of the clean energy strategy for carbon neutrality. The
New Capitalism Conference says that ¥150 trillion in investment is needed in the next 10 years to

achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
•  During the energy transition Japan will drive industrial structural changes and invest massively in
hydrogen, ammonia and other foundations of the future, Hagiuda said.

protect from natural disasters should be taken more into account, while Japan Wind Development
urged the MoE and other government agencies to speed up the project rollout. Mitsubishi Energy
Solutions said that too much emphasis on a speedy power generation launch may result in anti-
competitive behavior. Several operators opposed the 1 GW limit for consortiums participating in
multiple auctions. The operators were divided on METI’s request for comments on which should

have greater weight: plans leading to the power generation launch, or post-launch plans.
•  CONTEXT: Japan Wind Development warned that offshore wind projects have increased globally
following the Ukraine war. Japan’s goal for 5.7 GW offshore capacity by 2030 is not large enough
to attract the interest of equipment makers, since other countries have larger projects.



Power grids to work closer on nuclear decommissioning

(Japan NRG, May 30)
•  Power grids will work together on nuclear decommissioning as 18 plants will enter the reactor
dismantling phase for the first time. The decommissioning will start in a few years and low-
radioactive contaminated material will be generated in the process.
•  The government will develop safety standards for low-level radioactive waste, as well as build
schemes for re-use of scrap metal that passed the nuclear clearance standards. Power grids will

also study how they can conduct maintenance without closing the plants and spot component
defects effectively.
•  CONTEXT: METI said major decommissioning issues are limited by the financial muscle of the
grids, a lack of space in the plant premise for decommissioning, and a lack of best practices
knowledge base.




Promoting Fukui as nuclear industry zone
(Japan NRG, June 3)
•  METI and Fukui Prefecture are promoting the Reinan region as a nuclear industry zone for setting
up companies engaged in nuclear decommissioning and recycling plants of metal scrap from old
nuclear reactors.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan’s nuclear hub meets to discuss a potential pivot to hydrogen

(Mainichi Shimbun, June 4)
o  A meeting was held in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture, to discuss the creation of new
industries in the areas where the prefecture's nuclear power plants are located.
o  The government presented a proposal that included the industrialization of nuclear
decommissioning and the creation of a hydrogen supply base. Although no roadmap was
presented, the proposal is expected to be finalized after minor revisions in the near

future.
o  Some participants called for the government to clearly state its policy on replacing aging
reactors and on building new nuclear power plants.
o  The 15-member council includes the national government, the prefectural government,
one city and three towns where nuclear power plants are located, as well as the
presidents of power companies, and university professors.

EU competition lawyer says anti-trust exemptions needed to push carbon neutrality
(Japan NRG, June 3)
•  Brussels-based competition lawyer Maurits Dolmans told METI that lenient competition regulation
is needed to push carbon neutrality, because the market alone can’t spur the necessary products

and innovations.
•  The EU revised its competition law so that sustainability-driven business collaborations that serve
consumer collective interests are possible under a new framework called “sustainability
agreements”.
•  Dolmans said if Japan plans to introduce a similar scheme, by writing new guidelines that
supplement the Anti-Monopoly Act, the competition authority needs to recognize that guidelines

provide limited clarity in the application of Anti-Monopoly Act and visibility for the business
community. The bottom line is, the Japan Fair Trade Commission should offer guidance to
companies seeking sustainability-driven alliances.
•  On June 3, METI will invite Dirk Middelschulte, global competition counsel for Unilever, to deliver
a presentation.
• TAKEAWAY: Companies approach the Japan Fair Trade Commission for guidance when planning mergers.
While they’re encouraged to do this for joint R&D and pilot projects or forming associations, companies rarely

do so since joint initiatives outside M&A don’t require regulatory approval. Guidelines would be the fast track
approach to introduce the “sustainability agreement” scheme in Japan. While speedy rollout of hydrogen,
ammonia and other net-zero projects, and competition framework supporting them are needed, regulatory
oversights are still required over standardization of technologies and specifications, licensing of technologies
essential to meet the standards, data firewall to prevent sharing of irrelevant business data, and a clear
roadmap on how companies compete after completing the joint initiative.



Japan briefs South Korea on Fukushima waste water release
(Foreign Ministry statement, June 2)
•  Japan held an online briefing for South Korean government officials regarding the Fukushima

waste water release. It described the process that led to the Nuclear Regulation Authority's
decision to approve the release and the IAEA’s review.
•  CONTEXT: Japan will be asking for more IAEA reviews of reactor decommissioning, fuel recycling
and other nuclear initiatives to establish a positive reputation globally notably in treating low-level
radioactive waste. As countries expand nuclear capacities, they will face challenges from waste
treatment, which could open business opportunities for Japan.




JERA moves forward ammonia co-firing test in Japan

(Denki Shimbun, June 1)
•  JERA and IHI decided to start the 20% co-firing of ammonia at the former’s Hekinan coal-fired
power plant starting FY2023, a year earlier than previously scheduled.
•  Initial tests for the technology have progressed well and JERA expects the installation of the
necessary burners, piping and other equipment can be done quicker.
•  CONTEXT: JERA plans to use ammonia for 20% of the fuel mix at Unit 4 (1 GW) of the Hekinan
plant to demonstrate that it is viable as a commercial technology.

Kawasaki Heavy says it designed world’s first hydrogen-fueled marine boiler

(New Energy Business News, June 1)
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries completed the basic design of a hydrogen-fueled marine boiler, a world
first. The design is similar to LNG-fueled marine boilers.
•  Unlike small land-use hydrogen boilers, Kawasaki’s design accounts for the specific conditions of
sea vessels, such as wave oscillation and space limitation.
•  The boiler will be installed on a large liquefied hydrogen carrier, which is planned to be put into
practical use in the mid-2020s.
• TAKEAWAY: Kawasaki Heavy has staked its future on the shipment of hydrogen in liquid form, but this is a big

risk as other methods of long-distance transport, such as via MCH or ammonia, are proving cheaper and more

(TBS, May 27)
•  The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will proceed with a plan mandating installation of roof
mounted solar panels, not only on houses but also other residential buildings.
•  All construction companies whose annual output exceeds 20,000 square meters of floor area will

be required to participate. This will result in panels becoming mandatory on about half of Tokyo
residential buildings.
•  Governor Koike Yuriko says Tokyo does not have the luxury of open space suitable for large-scale
solar farms, so must turn to rooftop panels.

NEWS:     POWER       MARKETS






NUCLEAR REACTOR RESTARTS
•  There is a tug-of-war in the nuclear space, with the result being a one-step forward, one-step back
situation. Eventually, the national government’s more bullish stance on nuclear is likely to prevail
and result in a higher number of reactors in operations than today. However, with the anti-nuclear

community also strong, we expect their actions to intensify.
•  As of today, there are just four reactors out of a possible 33 in operation in Japan.

Government revises plan to help improve nuclear restart process
(Nikkei Shimbun, June 4)
o  The government included the phrase "rigorous and efficient review" with regards to the

restart of nuclear power plants in the revised draft of the Basic Policy for Economic and
Fiscal Management and Reform.
o  Behind the inclusion of the phrase lies dissatisfaction within the government and the
ruling party over the Nuclear Regulation Authority's (NRA) review process. In some cases,
it is taking many years for the NRA to review the restart of a reactor.
o  In April, PM Kishida also mentioned "streamlining and improving the efficiency" of the
nuclear review process.

o  The revised policy also clearly states that nuclear power plants will be "utilized to the
maximum extent possible," a more aggressive stance than the policy adopted in 2021.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hokkaido court upholds injunction against Tomari restart
(NHK, May 31)

o  The Sapporo District Court has upheld a petition filed on behalf of 1200 residents living
near the Tomari nuclear power plant that called for an injunction against its restart.
o  The court found that the plant did not meet tsunami-proofing requirements.
o  This is the first time that a court issued an injunction against the restart of a nuclear plant
on the grounds of tsunami risk.
o  While the plaintiffs also petitioned for decommissioning the plant and nuclear fuel to be
removed, this petition was not upheld by the court.

o  Hokkaido Electric will appeal the decision.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Shimane Governor gives green light to nuclear restart
(NHK, June 2)
o  Shimane Governor Maruyama Tatsuya supports the restart of Unit 2 of the Shimane

nuclear power station in Matsue.
o  He cited the need to ensure electricity supply to support industry and jobs.
o  Over 450,000 people live within a 30 km radius of the reactor; many would have to
evacuate to neighboring prefectures in case of an emergency.

o  The reactor is a boiling water reactor, the same type as reactor that was involved in the
Fukushima nuclear disaster.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Zero-nuclear federation opposes reactor restarts

(Tokyo Shimbun, June 2)
o  The Federation of Promotion of Zero-Nuclear Power and Renewable Energy, which is
advised by former PM Koizumi Jun’ichiro, has opposed calls from within the LDP to
restart idle nuclear reactors.
o  Koizumi said the nuclear reactors are effectively nuclear weapons aimed at Japan, and
called for an end to nuclear power and more renewables.
o  While surging energy prices have led to calls for more use of nuclear energy, the

Federation called to be prudent. It cited the Russian attack on a Ukrainian nuclear plant
and suggested Japan’s plants would also be vulnerable in the event of an invasion.


METI lowers estimate for power capacity reserves in western Japan
(Yomiuri Shimbun, May 28)
•  METI’s latest forecast for power capacity reserves in Kansai and Chubu areas shows there’ll be little

backup available this summer. The ratio will drop to just 3.1% in case of very hot weather.
•  The government expected more nuclear reactors to restart in the Kansai area. Kansai Electric
recently announced delays to its restart of Unit 3 at the Takahama nuclear power plant, initially
expected to be online in May.
• TAKEAWAY: See this week’s Analysis section for a full breakdown of the power crunch expected this summer.



Power utilities to boost rates for businesses; major gas companies to raise prices
(Jiji Press, May 27)
•  The four major city gas companies (Tokyo, Osaka, Toho and Saibu) will raise prices in July, for the

11th month in a row.
•  Seven of the 10 large power utilities have reached the limit by how much they can raise prices for
consumers, but all will increase fees for corporations and businesses next month, including high-
voltage and special high-voltage suppliers.
•  The biggest household price hikes will be in the Tokyo region.



Kansai Electric plans to develop up to 620 MW in onshore wind capacity in Japan

Marubeni seeks to switch a Japanese island entirely to solar and battery power
(Company Statement, May 31)
•  Trading house Marubeni will install solar PV systems on roofs and at parking lots on Amami Oshima
Island at no initial cost for owners, and then sell the electricity to them based on long-term

purchase agreements.
•  Amami Oshima (Kagoshima Prefecture) isn’t connected to the national grid.
•  CONTEXT: Remote islands mostly rely on thermal power due to its dispatchable mode of
operation and cost, but this leads to high emissions. To date, the use of variable renewables on
remote islands was seen as impractical as the weather can destabilize the supply-demand balance.

Why TEPCO sold off its “tiger cub” renewables unit to Toyota Tsusho

(Diamond, June 1)
•  CONTEXT: TEPCO sold its 40% stake in the wind power generation venture, Eurus Energy, to the
other shareholder, Toyota Tsusho, for ¥185 billion. Eurus is one of Japan’s biggest renewable
energy companies.
•  Toyota Motor Group had been seeking to acquire TEPCO's stake in Eurus since 2019. Toyota
sought to acquire bigger access to renewable energy, which is seen as indispensable for its survival
in the mobility business. Toyota was pressuring its affiliated trading house, Toyota Tsusho, to take

full control of Eurus.
•  TEPCO also wanted full control of Eurus, but its financials deteriorated due to the jump in fuel
prices since the Ukraine war and the weak yen. There’s concern that state-backed TEPCO may fall
into the red for the first time in a decade.
•  Much of TEPCO's debt is based on staying in the black. Its main lenders reached a limit on the
loans they can extend. So TEPCO needed to sell Eurus shares to ensure it remained profitable.
•  Other buyers interested in Eurus shares included JERA.




New system can predict solar farm faults before they happen
(Nikkei, June 1)
•  Kanazawa firm Ryoki Kogyo developed an AI-based system that can predict malfunctions in the

new solar power generation facilities.



Osaka biomass venture credits success to CEO’s vision

(Sankei, June 2)
•  T1 Holdings supplies carbon-neutral electricity to the Osaka area using a 5.8 MW wood-fired
generator.
•  The 60,000 metric tons of wood chips used annually are sourced from trimmed branches and
discarded wooden objects.
•  The success owes to the vision of CEO Tono Hayato, who recognized the potential of carbon-
neutral energy eight years ago following the 2014 earthquake and tsunami.
•  With nearly 1 million tons of wood waste generated in the six prefectures of the Kinki region every

year, there’s potential to boost output.

NEWS:     OIL,   GAS   &  MINING






Cosmo unit develops Japan’s first bio-certified diesel oil
(Sekiyu Tsushin, May 30)
•  Cosmo Oil Lubricants, a group company of Cosmo Energy Holdings, has developed a diesel
engine oil that contains more than 80% plant-derived oil.
•  This is the first diesel engine oil in Japan to be certified with the biomass mark (i.e. it is made up of
at least 80% biomass).

•  Normally, burning lubricating oil creates CO2 emissions, but the plant-derived components in the
new Cosmo product absorb CO2 in the growth process, thus reducing the disbursement of carbon

Undersea Cable Tech Can Boost Japan’s Offshore Wind Industry
Japan identified offshore wind power as one of the core sectors to help cut the
nation’s reliance on fossil fuels. As the nation starts to build the offshore wind sector
almost from scratch, however, a number of technical challenges have become
apparent. One is the knowledge and experience gap in power transmission systems.

Simply put, Japan needs to accelerate R&D in technologies such as power cables.
The kind of cables used locally to date are different to the lines that will be required
to connect the 45 GW in offshore wind power projects the government envisions in
the waters by 2040.

First, however, the government must determine which transmission infrastructure will
need to be built or strengthened. After suffering setbacks in the past in developing
domestic wind turbines, Japan is keen to avoid the same in technology that will
deliver the electricity to consumers.

One type of grid technology gaining attention, and already receiving financing, is
long-distance direct current (DC) transmission via undersea cable.


AC or DC?
Electricity is transmitted via either alternate current (AC) or direct current (DC)
transmission lines. While each has strengths and weaknesses, DC is superior in long-
distance transmission (50 km and longer for undersea cable). AC transmission has a
power loss issue arising from “reactive power”, which reduces the capacity of cables.

In March 2021, METI launched a study group to address technical and commercial
challenges of installing DC subsea cables for the transmission of offshore wind power.
Since Japan’s offshore wind resources are mostly in Hokkaido, Tohoku and Kyushu,
far from regions with high electricity demand, the DC system is expected to improve
the grid resilience and promote inter-regional transmissions.

High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is not a new technology. The world’s first
commercial HVDC system was set up in 1954 linking the island of Gotland to
mainland Sweden using a submarine cable system. In 2009, Germany’s BorWin 1
project became the world’s first offshore wind farm using a 200 km HVDC cable
connection (125 km subsea, 75 km on land).

In Japan, the DC system is used in a few regions, with only two examples of a DC
connection via undersea cables, neither of which is used for the transmission of
offshore wind power. The first is a 43 km transmission line between the northernmost
island of Hokkaido and the main island of Honshu. The second is a 49 km line
between Wakayama in west Japan and Tokushima on Shikoku Island.


Master plan for transmission
In May 2021, the Organization for Cross-regions Coordination of Transmission
Operators (OCCTO), Japan’s grid monitor, released an interim master plan for

17

nationwide transmission, identifying several routes for possible new construction, with
an estimated cost of ¥3.8 ~ ¥4.8 trillion under the scenario of 45 GW offshore wind
capacity.

One route would use HVDC undersea cables (8 GW) between Hokkaido and Tokyo
with an estimated cost of ¥1.5 ~ ¥2.2 trillion. A large volume of renewable electricity
to be produced in Hokkaido must be sent to the main island, and HVDC has an
economic advantage in long-distance transmission compared with an AC connection,
says OCCTO.

METI’s DC subsea cable taskforce has picked a group comprising the Promotion and
Research Institute for Ocean Economics, J-Power Transmission Network and Eukote
Energy (a subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho-owned wind developer Eurus Energy) to
conduct a technical feasibility study.

The group examined DC transmission routes from Hokkaido to the mainland via
undersea routes both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean, and in April 2022
described several challenges in a report. Below are some examples.

There is high demand globally for large-size vessels that can be used to lay undersea
cables. So, it’s uncertain if they’ll be available for projects in Japan. Meanwhile,
building a new vessel takes three to four years.

Based on the DC subsea cable taskforce’s review of various scenarios, Japan could
aim to have undersea cables for offshore wind power facilities ready and operational
between 2030 and 2036.

METI plans further study and allocated ¥5 billion to research long-distance DC
transmission to measure the ocean depth, study geological structures, wind and wave
conditions and prior uses.

Advantage of near-shore wind farms
One option for Japan is to install turbines along the coast, not far from shore. That’s
different from European offshore wind farms that are often far from coastlines. Using
near-shore turbines could support the development of multi-terminal HVDC systems,
something that is backed by The New Energy and Industrial Technology
Development Organization (NEDO).

Multi-terminal HVDC systems can transmit electricity more efficiently by connecting
multiple offshore wind farms with multiple onshore transformer stations and also
linking offshore transformer stations with each other, NEDO says.

Japanese companies don’t have much experience in building DC transmission
systems via undersea cables at home, but some have been active in overseas
projects. The grid unit of Hitachi, which acquired the business from ABB several years
ago, won an order to supply its HVDC systems to UK’s Dogger Bank offshore wind
farm, one of the world’s largest.

Hitachi has the largest share as supplier of AC/DC converters for offshore HVDC and
converter stations. Sumitomo Electric, a Japanese manufacturer of HVDC cables,
earlier this year signed an MoU to work with Norway’s Seaway7 for offshore wind
projects in Asia.


Takeaway
Even though Japan lags behind other major countries in offshore wind, the country
has an opportunity to leapfrog to the front of the pack through making
breakthroughs in certain parts of the technology and supply chain that boost
efficiency. This will require coordinated action between government and the industry.

For example, regulations need to be revised so builders can use more globally
standardized equipment to reduce cost and speed up installations. Though
transmission is only a part of offshore wind development, if successful, HVDC subsea
cable installations can be replicated in other parts of Japan and beyond.

Every Bit Counts:
Japan’s Summer Power Crunch May Require Drastic Measures

Every May, METI urges the nation to conserve power ahead of the scorching summer
heat, one of Japan’s two peak demand seasons. This year METI Minister Hagiuda
took a step that the government usually holds until the very last: He aimed his power-
saving message squarely at households. This is surprising considering that national
elections are almost six weeks away.

The minister was careful to note that “the country has sufficient power but we need
to stay alert in case of plant glitches and possible fuel shortages due to the conflict in
Ukraine.”

Just how little Japan’s power system has in reserve was highlighted in March when a
strong earthquake in the northeast took more than a dozen coal, gas and
hydropower plants offline. The Tokyo area narrowly escaped a blackout, thanks to
frantic government calls to cut power consumption and pumped hydro storage
facilities.

In the heat of summer, and its accompanying typhoon season, the potential for
disruptions is higher than ever; at least 1 GW of capacity damaged by the March
quake will remain under repair. Minister Hagiuda’s appeal is meant to ensure the
public can shrink its power use quickly and be ready to do so multiple times.

How much power conservation can play a role in decarbonization will be put to a
stress test over the next three to four months.

Government Appeal to Consumers
•  Families should gather in one room, watch one TV set and turn one air-
conditioner
•  Switch off toilet seat warmers
•  When going out, make sure to turn off the AC well before leaving
•  Unplug your TV before you travel, unplug appliances when not in use
•  Don’t overstuff the refrigerator, give your food some breathing space


Demand-response in real time
Japan’s response to critical power capacity shortages shortly after the earthquake in
March allowed consumption to drop by 5 GWh in a matter of a few hours. Such a
massive drop was more than expected, so it was inevitable that the government
would again turn to demand-side measures during peak seasons.

The problem in March was the sudden nature of the warning despite availability of
forecasts for a cold snap, which prompted criticism from business. This time, METI
has decided to get ahead of the issue by setting the power saving alert for two days
in advance.

NOTE: The figures are sales logged by all licensed power operators in addition to regional grids, and do not include self-
consumption

Japan’s power demand surges in January-February, then hits a low in May-June and
finally climbs again in July. In Tokyo, May temperatures are typically 10-20°C. June
temperatures hover in the range of 15-25°C. Some days are steamy, fetching above
24°C and making people switch on air conditioners. July sees more days with
temperatures above 30°C. According to a Cross Marketing survey, 33.8% of
households keep air-conditioners on the whole day.

Data from the Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of Transmission
Operators (OCCTO) showed household power consumption rose 2.2%, or 500 GWh
in July 2020, from a year ago due to the spread of remote work.

This year temperatures have been volatile. In Tokyo, February-March temperatures
were two to three degrees lower than last year. However, in May, Tochigi and Gunma
prefectures near Tokyo hit record-highs of 35°C.


Weather forecast: scorching
The Japan Meteorological Agency forecasts this summer to be hot with the chance of
July-August temperatures rising 40% above 30-year averages for most of Japan. A
power demand surge is expected, yet the most recent supply-demand forecast from
OCCTO shows the supply side reserve is threadbare: 4.1%-6.2% during July-
September, with July the most critical.

Nationwide supplies are seen at 177 GW; demand at 170 GW, resulting in a reserve
rate of 4.1%, according to OCCTO data. The forecast factored in supplies of 87
power operators with over 100 MW in capacity, and demand scenario based on the
highest temperatures on record. It does not include possible additional supplies
secured through auctions.

The 4.1%-6.2% reserve is above the 3% critical threshold METI seeks. However,
utilities warn that reserve rates actually need to be near 10% to guarantee supply
security. In March, before the accident, the reserve rate for Tokyo and Tohoku
regions was 7.5%.

In July, Tohoku, Tokyo and Chubu will see reserve rates drop to 3.1%. This means
Tokyo will have just 800 MW spare power generation capacity. If temperatures rise
above 35°C or there’s a natural disaster, then shortages will ensue. The March quake
knocked around 7 GW offline.

Borrowing spare capacity from other areas is an option, although throughput is
limited to a couple gigawatt. But this year, aside from Hokkaido (north) and Okinawa
(south), no area has a surplus.


On the edge
The METI minister said the government has done all it can to secure energy supplies,
for example, forcing power operators to consult with METI before scrapping aging
thermal power plants. It has kept a hawk eye on LNG stocks, requiring utilities to
report their levels weekly. METI officials have engaged in bilateral talks with LNG and
oil producing countries, urging output increases.

METI has also released oil stockpiles to cool fuel prices. Its efforts to restart nuclear
reactors is a work-in-progress with mixed results.

Meanwhile, as the grid watchdog, OCCTO has received greater power to force
utilities to cooperate. It was found, for example, that Tohoku and TEPCO grids didn’t
share some essential data on interconnectors, affecting power flow between the two
areas.

All these measures, however, have a limit. New supply, such as making rooftop solar
compulsory on new buildings, backed by Tokyo and national governments, will take
time to come into effect and make a difference.

So, the government is turning back the clock to 2011, when citizens were galvanized
by the spirit of resilience to endure room temperatures of 28°C in order to save
power.

People refrained from opening the fridge one too many times to combat damage
from the 9.1 magnitude earthquake and 30-meter tsunami, and protest the use of
nuclear power after the disaster at Fukushima.

How diligently Tokyo dwellers respond to the challenge this time, with the cause less
clear and the timeline uncertain, will show the extent to which power saving can
become a regular feature of life.

JOBS   IN  JAPAN’S     ENERGY       SECTOR


BY ARTHUR (RIKU) OGAWA

How to Retain Talent in a Hot Labor Market?

Finding the right talent is only one half of your hiring solution. Although Japan is still
far behind other developed countries in terms of career switching, professionals here
are becoming more active when it comes to considering new career opportunities
these days.

If you are hiring now, or have a small team in which each person plays an important
role, then below are the questions we encourage you to ask yourself:
1. Is your market competitive/ ‘hot’?
2. Is hiring a long-term investment or a temporary measure?

If your answer to both questions is “Yes” then a retention plan should be high on
your hiring agenda.

Let’s sort out the definitions first. A market often becomes ‘hot’ because it’s new and
emerging. Some obvious examples of highlight competitive and new areas in Japan’s
energy:
●  Offshore wind
●  Hydrogen
●  Battery/Energy storage

In this situation, just finding the right talent isn’t enough. It’s also important to make
sure your search/hiring efforts pay off long-term. If you wish to secure the right hire,
then start by understanding your future employees better. Below are the most
common things candidates cite as a reason to change jobs.

As the above chart shows, salary is often an important and a contributing factor to a
person seeking to change jobs, but it’s rarely the main reason for leaving their current
position.

In many cases, addressing some of the reasons above can help retain valuable talent
for the long-term. Some solutions can be:

Improve the work-life balance, team synergy,
Work culture / environment
create an atmosphere of safety and trust

Work on a career plan with your employees, set
Seeking career growth
clear targets and tangible timelines
Provide an annual raise or rewards based on
Salary
certain achievements
If change is inevitable, then make it as smooth as

Unwelcome changes in current post possible and plan the timeline of the shift to
reduce employee stress

Ultimately, people will switch jobs when the number of reasons to do so outweigh
those to stay in place. The best employers will take actions to tip the balance so that
it is always in favor of the latter.

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Energy transition
Construction began at both ends of a new transmission network — the $2.3 billion
Project EnergyConnect that will link renewables-rich South Australia with coal-
dominated New South Wales. The 900 km network will help bring online about 2.5
GW of new wind and solar capacity, and it will improve grid reliability.

Chad/ Renewables
UK-based Savannah Energy will develop up to 500 MW of utility-scale renewables.
The first project comprises 300 MW of solar and a battery energy storage system
(BESS) that will provide power for the Doba Oil Project. It’s due to be operational in
2025.

China/ EVs
China’s car exports are increasing, and most are EVs sold to Europe. From almost
nothing a few years ago, China exported about 500,000 EVs in 2021; its share of the
EU market is surpassed only by Germany. As the auto market transitions to EVs,
Europe might soon run a trade deficit with China in cars. By the end of 2022, there’ll
be more than 27 million EVs on the road out of a global fleet of more than 1 billion
cars.

Denmark/ Natural gas
Ørsted said Russia stopped gas supplies to Denmark after it refused Moscow’s ruble
payments scheme. In previous weeks Moscow has halted gas supplies to Finland,
Poland and Bulgaria also for refusing ruble payments. This week, gas was turned off
to the Netherlands.

EU/ Oil ban
The EU will ban seaborne Russian oil imports. However, landlocked countries such as
Hungary, can continue pipeline shipments. Germany and Poland will end pipeline
purchases later this year; combined with the seaborne ban, Russian oil exports to the
EU will decline by 90% by 2023. Russia produced about 10% of global oil supplies
before the war.

Fossil fuel assets
University of Massachusetts’ researchers said that existing oil and gas projects worth
$1.4 trillion could lose value if the world slashes carbon emissions through
determined climate action. This would impact investments of $756 billion from
pension funds and other sources.

Green steel
Iberdrola, Vattenfall, and Siemens Gamesa committed to 100% net-zero steel by
joining the initiative, SteelZero, which is led by Climate Group in partnership with
Responsible Steel. The main target is 50% low-emission steel by 2030, and to reach
net zero by 2050.

India/ Coal and Renewables
Record renewable energy output reduced coal use in May, despite a 23% growth in
power demand. Renewable energy’s share in India’s power output rose to 14% in
May, up from 10% in April. Coal dropped to 72.4% of national generation, down from
76.8%. Coal's share, however, was still higher than 70.9% in May 2021.

Oil prices
Higher oil prices are here to stay as the transition from fossil fuels will contribute to a
coming economic “hurricane”, said Jamie Dimon, the long-time Chief Executive of
JPMorgan Chase. “That hurricane is out there, down the road, coming our way,"
Dimon said during an investor conference. "The chance of getting this right is
virtually nil. I don't think we remotely understand the complexity."

South Korea/ Offshore wind
Norway's Equinor plans to build 4-6 GW of offshore wind capacity. The first farm,
known as ‘Firefly’, will have 800 MW of capacity, cover 58 sq/miles, and will be
operational by 2029. Equinor is also in talks with South Korean firms to produce
turbines and cables for the project. The country aims for renewables to account for
20-25% of the national power mix by 2030, up from the current 6.6%.

UAE/ Green hydrogen
Three South Korean firms -- Korea Electric Power Corp, Samsung C&T Corp and
Korea Western Power -- will work with the United Arab Emirate's Petrolyn Chemie to
build a $1 billion green hydrogen and ammonia plant near the capital Abu Dhabi.
Once built, the plant will produce up to 200,000 tons of green ammonia a year.
