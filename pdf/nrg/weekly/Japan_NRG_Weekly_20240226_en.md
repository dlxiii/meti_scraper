Idemitsu joins project to build Japan’s largest green hydrogen supply chain by 2030

(Japan NRG, Feb 20)
•  Idemitsu Kosan joined the ENEOS-Hokkaido Electric project to build a green hydrogen plant in
Tomakomai city (Hokkaido). The three signed an MoU to build the country’s largest green
hydrogen supply chain by 2030.
•  They’ll explore building an electrolysis facility of over 100 MW capacity at the industrial zone in the
west part of Tomakomai. The final electrolysis capacity will be set after detailed demand studies of
over 300 local manufacturers.
•  A 100 MW electrolyzer produces 10,000 metric tons / year of hydrogen; demand is forecast at

70,000 tons / year if all fossil fuels and other energy supplies are totally replaced by hydrogen.
•  The electrolyzer site has not been decided yet. Possibilities include Idemitsu’s Tomakomai plant
and Hokkaido Electric’s site.
• TAKEAWAY: Offshore wind would be the key power source, but using fossil fuel power and offsetting the
carbon with credits may be a possibility as there are uncertainties over national offshore wind projects, said a
Hokkaido Electric official. Five coastal areas in Hokkaido have “offshore promising zone” status. The projects

need to advance into the final “promotion zone” phase before construction. In addition, the five “promising
zones” are not along the Tomakomai coast but are located several hundred kilometers away.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Construction of Japan’s largest green hydrogen plant begins at Suntory's distillery

(Company statement, Feb 20)
o  A group led by TEPCO and Toray Industries began building a 16 MW P2G system that
uses a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer at Suntory’s Hakushu distillery in
Yamanashi Pref.

Honda targets U.S. data centers as consumers of its fuel cell systems
(Nikkei, Feb 22)
•  In 2025, Honda Motor plans to commercialize fuel cell systems to power data centers in North
America, to expand the use of fuel cell vehicle components and to halve their production cost.
•  Currently, in California the company is testing a 500 kW stationery FC system, comprising eight
FCV power units. The FC systems were developed with GM.
•  CONTEXT: Like Honda using Clarity and CR-V fuel cell units for data center backup power, Toyota

Motor’s FCV model Mirai has been the basis of FC generators developed by its group companies.
• TAKEAWAY: In December, Honda said that together with Tokuyama Corp and Mitsubishi Corp it had launched
a field test of the FC system at a data center in Yamaguchi Pref. If commercialization is realized in 2025,
deployment of the system could spread to other Honda manufacturing sites and to those of its partners.

•  The quake damaged the water pipe that pumps up deep sea water to cultivate the seaweed. The
wind turbines and transmission systems, however, were not damaged.
•  CONTEXT: The 7.5 MW Nyuzen wind power farm came onstream in September. The research was
on seaweed growth on concrete supports of fixed foundation wind turbines. Shimizu plans to
develop a high density seaweed forest around the concrete that could potentially be used as blue

carbon resources.



Taiko Paper to produce SAF from construction waste

(Company statement, Feb 20)
•  Taiko Paper Manufacturing and Biomaterial in Tokyo Co will team up to produce bioethanol from
pulp that’s derived from construction waste and other biomass.
•  By 2027, the companies plan to produce 20,000 metric tons / year of bioethanol, to be converted
into SAF.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese companies and municipalities have explored ways to make use of scrap
paper, construction and other waste as cellulose bioethanol feedstock, since the country does not
grow bioethanol crops extensively. In 2027, Nippon Paper Industries will also bring online a

bioethanol plant using wooden biomass as feed.



Hokkaido Univ startup to raise funds for plastic waste-fueled satellite engines

(Japan NRG, Feb 20)
•  In September, Letara, a startup developing space satellite engines fueled by plastic waste, will
issue new shares, which would be its second round of fundraising since being founded in 2020.
Letara is a spinoff of Hokkaido University.
•  Plastic-derived fuel is a solid, and is easier and safer to handle compared to liquid hydrogen,
oxygen or other fuels. The use of plastic waste as fuel feedstock would cut production costs
significantly. Tokyo Metropolitan University is the first satellite engine user.
•  Last year, the company issued ¥120 million worth of equity warrants to five venture capitalists.

Sakurai Keisuke, the company director, told Japan NRG that there’s interest from about five more
Tokyo-based venture capitalists, but he declined to elaborate.

OCCTO  seeks new mechanism for medium- to long-term balancing on capacity market

(Denki Shimbun, Feb 22)
•  OCCTO will create a new mechanism to ensure medium- to long-term balancing capacity. The
concern is that with a strong expansion of renewables, there might not be enough power capacity
online that’s able to provide the adjustment function.
•  OCCTO will consider ways to utilize the current capacity market framework to address the issue.
The idea will be discussed at a meeting of experts responsible for the institutional design of the
capacity market.
•  Forecasts made by OCCTO assume that by the first half of the 2030s there will be a shortage of

power assets able to play the adjustment role. While the installed power capacity in each area is
expected to be adequate, the continued rollout of renewables and retirement of thermal capacity
will affect the current power adjustment system.
•  At the Committee on Balancing Capacity and Demand-Supply Balance Assessment on Feb 20,
OCCTO considered measures to secure balancing capacity for the next 10 years. Three proposals
were presented to address the issue:
o  (1) Utilization of the capacity market

o  (2) Public offering of balancing capacity sources
o  (3) Bilateral contract for balancing capacity sources.



New power market players gradually warm to electricity futures

(Denki Shimbun, Feb 22)
•  The use of electricity futures trading has begun to spread to new power market players (known in
Japanese as the shin denryoku).
•  Players like erex Co. and Eneres are taking it even further. In addition to the benefits of being able
to hedge the risks associated with electricity procurement, erex has launched a price menu that
lets clients fix their rates to those of electricity futures.

•  Power futures is no longer seen as only a price-risk management strategy, but a tool for sales.
•  CONTEXT: In recent years, some new market players were among the most affected by rising
electricity prices because their business model was effectively based on expectations of a gradual
decrease in power prices. Meanwhile, power futures trading volumes grew steadily as more and
more of the big power utilities joined the market.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Kansai Electric unit asks for closer links between futures market and spot market
(Government statement, various media, Feb 19)
o  METI held a meeting of its study group on electricity futures. Among those in attendance
was a unit of Kansai Electric (Kanden Energy Solution, or Kenes).

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Kenes said they were using TOCOM's electricity futures trading in order to hedge risks
within the scope of actual demand, and requested institutional support for the
application of "hedge accounting" to expand trading.
o  The firm said that trading volumes remain at about 20% of the total generated amount
due to the difficulty procuring large quantities on the market.
o  They stressed the need to strengthen cooperation between TOCOM and JEPX, and

requested that the liquidity of TOCOM's auction trading be improved.



Tohoku Electric delays Onagawa NPP safety work, aims for Sept restart

(Company statement, Feb 19)
•  Tohoku Electric will reassess the completion date for safety work on Unit 2 of Onagawa NPP
(Miyagi Pref).
•  Due to delays in fire protection measure work, the completion date is now aimed for June 2024,
instead of this month. The unit’s restart is now planned for Sept 2024.
•  CONTEXT: Tohoku first applied to the regulator for a restart of the 796 MW reactor (BWR type) in
December 2013.




Spot market sluggish due to increased supply and warm winter
(JEPX data, Feb 19)
•  In January, the daily average of power offered on the JEPX spot market was 1.19 TWh, up 7.9%

over December; the daily average amount of power purchased was 848 GWh.
•  CONTEXT: This weak demand seems to be largely due to a warmer than average winter.
•  Supply in late-January was around 9.3 GW higher than at the month’s start. The average daily
purchase was 26.7% lower YoY.




NYK to invest ¥43 billion to expand crew transfer vessel fleet for offshore wind
(Company statement, Feb 20)
•  NYK ordered its first crew transfer vessel (CTV) from a Japanese shipyard that will be used to
transport workers to build and maintain offshore wind power farms. The vessel is set to be
delivered by 2026.
•  The vessel will be the third NYK-owned CTV and the second used in Japan.
•  CONTEXT: In Japan, the construction of offshore wind farms is expected to begin in 2026, and

likewise, demand for CTVs is expected to grow. NYK announced in March 2023 that the company
plans to invest ¥43 billion in the offshore wind power value chain by FY2026, and the construction
of CTVs is part of the plan.

PV service firm Xsol introduces lightweight panels for rooftop installations
(Company statement, Feb 15)
•  Xsol, a Kyoto-based solar PV producer and service provider, has developed its new light-weight
modules that weigh 26% less than standard panels.
•  The new modules weigh 17.8 kg, around 26% less than the same-sized solar panels, reducing the

load per square meter on rooftops from around 11.2 kg/m2 to 8.2 kg/m2. This allows solar panels
to be placed on buildings originally not intended for such installations, including steel-framed
buildings.
•  The new panel has cuts into the frame corners, allowing dirt on the panel surface to flow away with
rainwater, ensuring stable power generation.
•  CONTEXT: Solar panels on rooftops are installed at an angle that matches the roof, making it

difficult for accumulated dirt to be washed away by rainwater, and which can result in lower power
generation. On top of that, steel-framed buildings, such as warehouses and factories, are usually
not designed to allow the installation of any item on their rooftop.

















Kyocera has new long-duration backup storage battery system for home use

(Company statement, Feb 19)
•  Kyocera will launch its long-duration battery energy storage system that can handle 20,000 charge/
discharge cycles before deteriorating by 60%.
•  Kyocera said that the system, named Enerezza® Plus, is the world's first with built-in, semi-solid-
state clay-type lithium-ion storage batteries. It comes in three storage capacity sizes: 5.5 kWh, 11
kWh and 16.5 kWh.
•  It’s a multi-input hybrid that can be linked to solar PVs and storage batteries, and also external
power from HVs, EVs, generators, portable batteries and other appliances that can be used in a

home during power outages.

Daiichi NPP.
•  METI minister Saito stressed the need for TEPCO to ensure safety and retain public trust

•  A worker's mistake in closing a piping valve caused the leak. The NRA criticized TEPCO for its
management of the NPP’s decommissioning.
•  CONTEXT: The volume of leaked water was originally estimated at 5.5 tons, with radioactive
materials believed to be 22 billion Bq. After further examination, TEPCO revised this to 1.5 tons
and 6.6 billion Bq.
• TAKEAWAY: NRA Chairman Yamanaka told reporters on Feb 21 that he has noted that leakage incidents have

increased in the last few months, and found this unusual. He instructed the NRA on-site inspectors to make
more rigorous checks.

JERA to pay Woodside $1.4 bln to take 15% stake in Scarborough LNG project
(Company statement, Feb 23)
•  Woodside Energy is selling a 15.1% stake in its offshore Scarborough natural gas project to JERA

for about $1.4 billion, marking the Australian energy company’s second stake sale to a Japanese
LNG buyer in six months.
•  The deal is JERA's largest overseas LNG acquisition. When completed in the second half of 2024,
Woodside will end up with a 74.9% stake in the $12 billion Scarborough project, and continue as
its operator. The project plans its first LNG cargo in 2026.
•  Scarborough is located 375 km off the Pilbara coast of Western Australia.
•  Woodside also inked a non-binding agreement with JERA to annually supply six LNG cargoes from

its global portfolio for a decade starting in 2026.
•  CONTEXT: Japan is the world's second-largest LNG importer. Despite cutting imports over the
past decade, thanks to nuclear power restarts and renewable energy development, Japan still
relies on LNG for about a third of its electricity mix. Japanese companies have been diversifying
LNG sources through acquisitions abroad. In August 2023, Woodside sold a 10% stake in
Scarborough to LNG Japan (a venture between trading houses Sumitomo and Sojitz) for $500

million. In December, Tokyo Gas bought natural gas producer Rockcliff Energy in Texas in a $2.7
billion deal.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite making several high-level Japanese govt and company executive complaints against
Australia’s fossil fuel policies last year, JERA has still gone ahead with this very sizable acquisition. One way to
look at it is to say that JERA is simply looking for long-term supply stability. Another is to consider that the
recent move by the U.S. to pause the issuance of new permits for LNG export facilities has affected several
offtake contracts with Japanese buyers.





China helps Russia foil western sanctions on Arctic LNG 2 as shipments soon begin
(Financial Times, Feb 21)
•  Chinese technical and logistical expertise have supplanted western partners in the Arctic LNG 2
project, allowing Russia to export its first cargo despite U.S. sanctions.
•  For example, the Harbin Guanghan Gas Turbine provided the remaining turbines to operate the
first LNG train after a U.S. company terminated a contract to provide 21 turbines for all three LNG

trains.
•  A former Russian petrochemicals executive said “Chinese turbines are inferior to German or French
ones”, but they’re an “acceptable replacement”.
•  CONTEXT: In November, the U.S. placed Arctic LNG 2 under direct sanctions, stopping its allies
from helping to complete the project and buying its gas when production starts. Located above
the Arctic Circle in northern Siberia, Arctic LNG 2 was built to supply the Asian and European
markets. Annual production is planned at 19.8 million metric tons. The project is majority-owned

Kyushu Electric waits for clarity on U.S. LNG exports before investment decision
(Reuters, Feb 20)
•  Kyushu Electric is waiting for clarity on LNG export policies by the Biden administration before
deciding on investing in the Lake Charles gas project in the state of Louisiana.
•  Kyushu Electric is considering various other options to secure LNG supplies. However, the
company's overall annual LNG demand has decreased due to nuclear reactor restarts and

increased renewable energy use.
•  CONTEXT: Lake Charles was affected by President Biden's decision at the end of January to freeze
LNG exports approval. Owned by Energy Transfer, Lake Charles would liquefy natural gas and
export it.




MOL-owned LNG bunkering vessel completes first service
(Company statement, Feb 20)
•  In Singapore on Feb 16, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) LNG bunkering vessel Brassavola completed its

Aomori Moves Forward with Renewables Tax Plan

The development of Japan’s renewable energy sector continues to face some
unexpected challenges, with local governments voting into power a new generation
of leaders who are more willing to challenge the industry on issues that impinge upon
community interests. Gone are the days of unfettered renewable energy
development.

On February 20, the Aomori prefecture government released an overview of its
proposed budget for the next fiscal term that runs from April 2024 to March 2025. It
includes funds for writing new renewable regulations, showing that the plan for a new
renewables tax, which was first announced in last September, is moving forward.

Since Aomori ranks top among Japan’s prefectures in terms of the number of wind
power installations and total capacity, the planned tax and other regulatory measures
will have a broader impact on developers and operators across the entire country.

To date, few details have been released, and so, to find out more about the
prefecture’s plans, Japan NRG spoke with Aomori officials.


Aomori governor wants “Cohabitation”
Aomori governor Miyashita Soichiro, who took office last June, talks fast and makes
speedy decisions. Three months after landing his new job, he announced a plan for a
new regulatory scheme on renewable operators including a local tax, specific zones
where renewable energy facilities would be prohibited, and a new dialogue
framework between an operator and local stakeholders.

Miyashita then attacked the onshore wind operators that many locals see as exploiting
Aomori’s natural bounty, claiming that they profit at the expense of communities. He
said that he’s going to make them pay their fair share through the new local tax, and
that he is marketing his idea under the title of a “Cohabitation Scheme between
Nature and Renewables.” (See also “Local Taxes on Renewables Is Now a Trend –
Aomori Prefecture the Latest to Step Up” in the Analysis section of the Sept 25, 2023
issue).

The Aomori government had also put out a request for formal quotations for
preliminary research around Miyashita’s new cohabitation scheme. The envisioned
research scope includes looking into regulations related to off-limit zones, regulatory
practices around renewables in other municipalities, and identifying candidates for the
“Cohabitation Study Committee” that will advise the Aomori government. The
authorities also want a contractor to create the draft of a new communication process
between each renewables project and community stakeholders, and drafts for relevant
ordinance(s).

Last November, one contractor started on the relevant research and is expected to
complete the work on February 29. The research results are meant for internal use
only and will not be publicly disclosed, an Aomori official told Japan NRG. However,

the official assured that prior to establishing renewables no-go zones, there will be a
public consultation process. Since there are various interests at stake on zone setting,
the prefectural government will try to make the standards and processes as
transparent as possible, the official said.

Information relevant to the scheme will be available after the new fiscal year starts in
April, pending the prefectural assembly’s approval of the FY2024 budget plan. The
proposed budget included ¥14 million to write the new regulation.

During a February 20 news conference on the FY2024 budget, Miyashita spoke with
caution about his planned regulations. In September, he had been clear that all
renewables operators – wind, solar, biomass etc., of all sizes, new and long since
operational – would be targeted by the new tax.

A month after Miyashita revealed his plan, however, Aomori’s environmental policy
director-general told the local assembly that offshore wind won’t be subject to the
planned regulations because such projects are covered by the Act on Promoting the
Utilization of Sea Areas for Renewables.

This response raised speculation that the Miyashita government may be narrowing
down their targets to new operators only – which would be in sync with the approach
of Miyagi prefecture. That region introduced a local renewables tax to take effect in
April, but its application is limited to new solar, onshore wind and biomass operators
tearing down forests.


When asked whether all renewables projects or just new operators would be subject
to Aomori’s proposed rules, Miyashita said that this will depend on future discussions.
He declined further comment.

Miyashita’s basic energy strategy
Miyashita’s predecessor, Mimura Shingo, had pledged that Aomori would be carbon
neutral by 2050. While those carbon neutrality goals remain unchanged, Miyashita is
taking a different tack, with self-sufficiency at the core of his basic energy strategy.
During the September assembly debate on his cohabitation plan, Miyashita promoted
rooftop solar panel installations and the potential for renewables to meet local energy
needs.

“I’m for sustainable development of the local economy, driving local production and
consumption of energy by setting up renewable energy systems,” Miyashita said,
making clear his support for renewable energy but within the context of benefiting the
local community.

His FY2024 budget proposal included ¥80 million to subsidize residential rooftop
solar systems and ¥167 million to businesses for decarbonizing their processes and
introducing energy systems for own-power consumption. To date, only 19.7% of
Aomori-based businesses have been actively reducing their carbon footprint, which is
why the prefectural government is trying to raise climate awareness.

Aomori is also encouraging market entries into hydrogen, ammonia, carbon capture
and 11 other core net zero industries. Carbon capture through blue carbon is one

focus, and an offset credit system using seaweed resources is another direction due to
be explored.

The Mutsu coastal area once boasted Japan’s largest eelgrass sea forest, of about
7,200 hectares. It’s been shrinking due to industrialization. In addition to protecting
the sea forest, the goal is to create new economic value by issuing regional offset
credits, which would follow the example of cities like Yokohama and Fukuoka.

Miyashita’s total budget request for the general account amounted to ¥702 billion,
down 4.9% year-on-year. The governor said he canceled 275 projects to cut spending,
but on the other hand, he hiked by 29% the Nuclear Fuel Tax, a local tax levied on
Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd, which is effective this April. About 18% of the tax proceeds
will be provided to municipalities that host such nuclear facilities. This hike alone
should bring Aomori an additional ¥1.6 billion in tax revenue in FY2024.

The assembly’s budget committee began to review the budget proposal on February
22. The 47 assembly members are expected to vote on it by March 22.

Local assembly time table
The next assembly session after the budget approval is likely to convene in July,
followed by another in September and in November. The draft cohabitation
ordinance(s) for renewables no-go zones, the new local tax and community
engagement rules and procedures will likely be written by mid 2024, to be effective
starting April 2025.

After passing the assembly, new local taxes will require the approval of the Minister of
Internal Affairs and Communications. The Miyagi tax won approval inside four months.

The FY2024 budget proposal seems to show that Miyashita does not yet have a clear
scenario to realize his idea of Aomori as a region with “sustainable” renewables
facilities that power local needs. Likewise, local blue carbon won’t be enough to offset
Aomori’s carbon footprints.


In practical terms, the region needs to start looking for the “small renewable resources” that Miyashita
says he craves, but which are not well defined. This is something the governor and local assembly
members will have to address during debates on the new regulation.

Japan Incentivizes Battery Storage Projects Amid Growing Demand
The ramp up of battery storage projects in Japan continues apace, aided by growing
subsidy avenues and rising volumes on various electricity markets, from spot to
balancing to capacity.


As of May 2023, about 1.1 GW of supply has been contracted for grid-scale storage
batteries nationwide, with contracts for an additional 12 GW under consideration,
according to METI data. Unsurprisingly, the standout areas for projects are Kyushu
and Hokkaido, where a strong growth in solar and wind power projects has led to
challenges with balancing the grid. But other regions are also attracting developer
interest.

This trend is driven by a clear sense of urgency on the part of national and local
authorities. It’s no surprise that as METI launched an entirely new “green” capacity
auction system this year, officials made sure to allocate up to a quarter of its initial 4
GW on offer to battery and other energy storage projects.

The need to incentivize more balancing capacity in Japan is strong. Renewable energy
sources already account for a fifth of domestic electricity volumes, but the sector’s
further expansion is focused on solar and wind power, which are intermittent. By 2030,
official estimates show variable renewable energy reaching 20% of Japan’s power mix.

Noting the demand case and ever-growing renewables curtailment numbers
nationwide, more and more firms are tapping into Japan’s battery storage
opportunities. We take a look at some of the prominent projects on the horizon.

The curtailment challenge
Electricity curtailment, which started as a Kyushu-only issue, has grown nationwide.
The volume of electricity curtailed in FY2023 in Kyushu alone is estimated at 760
GWh, enough to power a mid-size town in the prefecture for a year. Curtailments
were also carried out in the Chubu, Kansai and Hokuriku regions. Kyushu and
Hokkaido have seen the largest number of applications to connect the battery energy
storage system (BESS) technology to local power grids.

To address the issue, last year NTT
Anode Energy, Kyushu Electric (Kyuden),
and Mitsubishi Corporation launched a
1.4 MW / 4.2 MWh grid-scale battery
storage system in Tagawa, Fukuoka
Prefecture (Kyushu). From April to June
of 2023, when the amount of solar
power curtailment increased, the firms
conducted 47 cycles, a total energy
charge and discharge of 260 MWh. The
developers also plan to be active on the
capacity market from FY2025.

A BESS can participate in the balancing market by providing balancing services to the
grid. This includes services such as frequency regulation, which helps to balance the
supply and demand of energy on the grid. In the capacity market, it can offer its
facility as a backup. The grid operator can then call on the BESS to provide energy
during peak periods, for instance, to avoid blackouts.

Depending on the local energy system, a BESS can also participate in the transmission
and distribution markets, by providing voltage regulation and line loss reduction
support.

A battery’s need to charge before being able to offer its electricity naturally lends to
arbitrage and financial optimization models. Through arbitrage, developers boost
revenue by buying energy during off-peak times when prices are cheaper and
releasing it, say, at night when demand and prices are higher.

One of the first firms to embrace a trading-oriented BESS model in Japan is Pacifico
Energy. In June 2023, the company launched two separate 2 MW battery storage
systems, each with 8 MWh of power output, in Sapporo (Hokkaido), and Itoshima
(Fukuoka). Pacifico Energy sourced batteries produced by Chinese firm Zhejiang
Narada Power Source, while engaging South Korea’s LS for engineering, procurement
and construction of the project.

Incentives
Still, an investment in a standalone battery facility is expensive and until recently, the
traded volumes in the electricity balancing, capacity and even futures markets in
Japan were small. This is unsurprising since the capacity market was only born in
2020, the balancing market introduced in April 2021, and cost-based imbalance
settlements started in 2022.


With the development of the battery storage sector in Japan limited at best, the
government started by introducing subsidies.

METI was the first to introduce a system to incentivize projects by allocating grants to
13 battery / BESS projects from its FY2021 supplementary budget, and another 18
projects in the following years 2022 and 2023.

In principle, METI subsidizes a third of the capital investment and half of the
technological development expenses. One of the first to make use of this scheme was
a group comprising Idemitsu, Renova, Nagase Group and SMFL Mirai Partners (a
Sumitomo Mitsui Finance & Leasing group firm). The group is developing a 15 MW
lithium-ion battery storage system in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, which is slated to
begin operation in October 2025.

The Himeji facility is expected to be active with balancing services on the JEPX spot
market, the capacity market and the balancing market. The system has been built
using GS Yuasa batteries, while JGC is in charge of engineering, procurement and
construction.

Further incentives have followed from local authorities. The Tokyo Metropolitan
Government has launched its own program for BESS projects over 1 MW (DC), which
means they can be connected directly to TEPCO’s grid. In August 2023, it released a
list of 26 beneficiaries with projects totaling 50.5 MW and an output of 171.6 MWh.
The subsidy amount totaled ¥9.62 billion.

The largest figure awarded by Tokyo, at ¥620 million, went to NTT Anode Energy for
its project in Tsurugashima City (Saitama Pref). The recipients list also included
Renewable Japan, afterFIT, Looop and JAPEX. Tokyo offers up to ¥2.5 billion per
project, as long as the amount does not exceed 80% of the cost.

Some operators have even tapped other, non-battery specific state funding channels.
Toyota Tsusho-controlled Terras Energy, for example, applied for a METI grant to run
Virtual Power Plant (VPP) projects, and secured funding to introduce a battery system
in Nagasaki City. In October 2023, it started operating Tesla’s lithium-ion batteries in
a 2 MW output system with 5.1 MWh of annual capacity.

The Nagasaki project will provide balancing services to the grid by using IoT to
manage several distributed power sources, energy storage units, EVs, and heat
pumps.

Conclusion
Japan’s commitment to renewables has set the stage for the rapid development of
the BESS market, which has begun attracting many overseas investors. In December
Singapore-based renewables developer Gurīn Energy announced plans to enter the
Japanese market, and build and operate the country’s largest project – a 4-hour BESS
with a 500 MW capacity capable of storing up to 2 GWh of electricity. It will be the
first large-scale project in Japan, helping to avoid some 7 million tons of CO2
emissions.

The market’s growth will not only contribute to Japan’s decarbonization goals, but will
also help create new “green” jobs around engineering, maintenance, and power

sales. It should also stimulate further maturity and liquidity in the country’s electricity
markets, which are already attracting the biggest names in global power trading.

Despite high expectations for growth in the BESS sector, Japan still needs to
overcome technological and economic challenges ranging from deployment and
maintenance to bankability. Overseas players who are experienced with business
models tested elsewhere will likely prove crucial in order for the market to soar.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

Australia / Green hydrogen
EnergyAustralia commissioned the Tallawarra B Power Station, the first dual-fuel
natural gas and green hydrogen plant, and the first gas-fired power station to be built
in New South Wales in over a decade. When launched in 2025, it will operate on a
blend of 5% (by volume) green hydrogen and natural gas.

China / Energy transition
In 2023, clean energy drove China's overall economic growth, accounting for a
staggering 40% of GDP expansion. Without clean energy sectors, China's GDP would
have fallen short of its target of 5%, with growth expected to have been 3% instead of
the achieved 5.2%.

India / Energy storage
In 2024, India will need 12 GW of energy storage capacity, with four hours of storage
per GW, in line with the govt’s policy. Along with the renewable purchase targets, the
govt will support the goal of installing 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030.

India / Rooftop solar
The govt streamlined the rooftop solar approvals process, making it easier for people
to claim subsidies from the $9 billion announced this month to promote the
technology. If 45 govt signatures were previously needed to set up a small rooftop
solar connection, today it’s almost instantaneous.

Papua New Guinea / Fuel crisis
The country faces a fuel crisis after its major supplier, Puma Energy, said there's "no
fuel supply until further notice". For almost a year, Puma has been struggling to meet
the country’s fuel needs, blaming the lack of foreign exchange to pay for oil imports.

Philippines / Renewable energy
Within the next three years, renewable energy company Enercon Asia Pte plans to
invest $40 mln to $100 mln in the Philippines’ clean energy sector. The Singapore-
based company is studying potential solar projects.

Singapore / Renewable energy
Singapore-based Vena Energy secured a $600 million sustainability-linked, five-year
Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) from ten financial institutions, such as DBS Bank, ING
Bank and BNP Paribas. Vena Energy has built solar, wind, and battery projects with a
total capacity of 3 GW.

South Korea / Floating offshore wind
Shell will sell its 80% stake in the MunmuBaram floating offshore wind farm to
Hexicon, a Swedish floating wind developer. Hexicon has support from Glennmont
Partners, one of Europe’s largest clean energy infrastructure funds. Hexicon will take
100% ownership of the $5 billion MunmuBaram project (1.3 GW planned capacity)
that launches in 2027.

Taiwan / Floating solar
Renewable energy platform HEXA Renewables, and Ciel & Terre Taiwan launched an
additional floating solar project with about 192 MW-peak capacity in the Chanbin
industrial zone. The site occupies over 171 hectares of water surface area.

UAE / Solar power
The Dubai Electric and Water Authority, and energy firm Masdar, inked a financial
close for the sixth phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park (1.8
GW planned capacity). This phase of the project costs around $1.5 billion.
