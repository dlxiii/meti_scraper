NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Japan and Saudi Arabia to cooperate on rare-earth development; PM tours the Middle East
(Japan NRG, Government statement, Nikkei, Reuters, July 17)
•  PM Kishida and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman met on Sunday, July 17, and agreed to
expand the energy relationship from one based on fossil fuel sales (mainly, crude oil and natural
gas) to encompass close cooperation also in clean energy. Among areas that Japan and Saudi
Arabia could jointly develop are investments in critical raw materials, such as rare earths mines and

refining facilities, the production of hydrogen and ammonia, e-fuels and solar power generation.
•  Kishida encouraged Saudi investment in Japan’s battery and semiconductor sectors and said he
hoped for concrete talks around this.
•  In terms of rare earths, Japan and Saudi Arabia will explore resource development projects in third
countries for joint investment, hoping to secure rights to these materials, which are used in EVs.
•  Japan’s state-owned resource company, JOGMEC, will contribute technical expertise to assist
Riyadh in conducting geological surveys. Japan will also help accelerate the development of

resources already being mined in Saudi Arabia, such as copper, iron and zinc.
•  PM Kishida is visiting Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar over July 16-18 to discuss Ukraine and other
geopolitical issues and pursue stronger bilateral relations collaborations such as in energy.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese-Saudi business relations are fostered in the framework of the “Saudi-Japan
Vision 2030” that was signed in 2017 and which METI called a "new compass ... to facilitate public
and private sector involvement between Saudi Arabia and Japan." As far as rare-earths, while
Saudi Arabia has long been a hydrocarbon superpower it’s keen to transition to clean energy, and

needs to search for rare-earth deposits close to home. Japan is also a primary market for Saudi
ammonia and hydrogen produced with natural gas.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan and Saudi Arabia seek to diversify supply chains for strategic metals to avoid depending
on any specific supplier. Japan already relies on China for nearly 80% of its lithium hydroxide supply, and over
60% of its cobalt processing. However, Japan was forced to seek other suppliers when China restricted rare-
earth exports in 2010 following tensions over the Senkaku Islands, which are Japanese administered but also

claimed by China.


In major shift, Toyota to focus on China and EU for sales of hydrogen-powered vehicles

(Reuters, July 11)
•  Toyota Motor will focus on selling hydrogen-powered trucks and cars in Europe and China, as part
of a push to sell 200,000 of these vehicles by 2030.
•  Fuel cell vehicles, also known as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, are powered by electric motors that
run on electricity generated from hydrogen fuel. These vehicles are considered clean and
sustainable as they emit zero emissions at the tailpipe.
•  Toyota sold just over 3,900 fuel cell vehicles in 2022, less than half of 1% of its global sales of

around 9.5 million vehicles.

•  Toyota said it expects the global market for fuel cells to grow to around $35 billion by 2030, up
more than 15-fold from 2020.
•  CONTEXT: Toyota is a pioneer in fuel cell vehicle technology with its flagship model, the Toyota
Mirai. The decision to focus on China and the EU marks a shift for the automaker, which believes
hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles should be considered as a realistic alternative to battery electric

vehicles. Until now Toyota's focus has been on passenger cars and the North American market, an
approach that has stalled.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI provides details for hydrogen fuel mobility strategy
(Government statement, July 11)
o  After updating the Basic Hydrogen Strategy last month, METI nailed down plans to

spread hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the mid-term.
o  The ministry’s survey of the private sector showed that the high cost of fuel cell (FC)
vehicles and hydrogen fuel itself, as well as a lack of hydrogen service stations, were
discouraging the spread. It plans to beef up subsidies to develop FC commercial vehicles
and taxis, and build more service stations to meet the 2030 targets.
o  An estimated ¥13.6 billion from the issue of so-called GX bonds and another ¥6.58
billion from a subsidy program will finance the FCV spread.

o  In addition to 70MPa FC service terminals, METI plans to add 35MPa terminals which
may reduce capital expenditure for this infrastructure.
o  METI will also identify areas with high potential for FCV spread, such as ports.

Hydrogen consumption in the Number of FCVs Number of hydrogen

Sumitomo and Rio Tinto collaborate on world's first hydrogen pilot for alumina refining
(Company statement, July 12)
•  Sumitomo and Rio Tinto will build a hydrogen pilot plant in Gladstone, Australia, to trial the use of
hydrogen instead of natural gas in alumina refining.
•  Sumitomo will own and operate a 2.5 MW electrolyser, producing over 250 tons of hydrogen
annually at Rio Tinto's Yarwun alumina refinery. The hydrogen will supply one of Rio Tinto's
calciners.

•  Construction begins in 2024, with the hydrogen plant and calciner to be operational by 2025. This
A$111 million project is supported by a A$32 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy
Agency. Japan’s JGC won the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contract.
• TAKEAWAY: Alumina refining accounts for about one-third of aluminum production costs. Low-carbon alumina
has higher commercial value than regular alumina. Previously, alumina and aluminum prices were closely
linked, but for the past decade many market participants were trading them as separate commodities with

their own pricing mechanism. It will be interesting to see what happens with increases in low-carbon alumina
supplies, and whether the market will return to the old practice of closely linking the two metal prices.

SPARX began a pilot for a renewable hydrogen supply chain in Hokkaido
(Company statement, July 10)
•  SPARX Green Energy & Technology began a pilot to create a hydrogen supply chain from
production through storage and shipping, to utilization in Tomakomai city, Hokkaido. This project

has been selected as the MoE’s “FY2023 model pilot project for lower cost hydrogen supply using
existing infrastructure.”
•  The project plans to produce and supply up to 1 million Nm3 renewable hydrogen annually by
combining electricity generated from waste at Tomakomai’s Numanohata Clean Center with solar
power generation. By supplying the self-generated electricity directly to the water electrolysis
plant, the need for installing a new renewable energy generation facility can be eliminated.
•  The surplus energy will reduce costs, and the hydrogen produced will be used in fuel cell batteries,

boilers, and stoves, which will reduce the local usage of kerosene.


Nippon Steel develops liquid hydrogen resilient steel for fuel cell stations
(Nikkei Shimbun, July 10)
•  Nippon Steel developed a stainless-steel resistant to liquid hydrogen, making it suitable for pipes
that pump from trucks into storage tanks at fuel cell stations.
•  The company found the right mix of chrome and manganese to improve corrosion resistance to

liquid hydrogen pumped at minus 235 C.
•  CONTEXT: The product offering for liquid hydrogen container materials is growing more diverse.
Earlier this year, Nippon Steel started to market HRX-19 stainless steel containing niobium and
vanadium. The new chrome-manganese stainless steel has stronger anti-corrosion features but less
durability than HRX19.
• TAKEAWAY: Every component used in fuel cell station systems, from rubber hoses to storage tanks, must have

strong corrosion resistance and durability. For example, hoses need to be replaced after 100 fills, which
increases costs to operate the service station.



Kyushu Electric to conduct second ammonia-coal co-firing test in fall
(Japan NRG, July 14)
•  Kyushu Electric plans to conduct its second ammonia-coal co-firing test in this coming fall at the
No. 2 Unit of Matsuura thermal power station in Nagasaki, a company spokeswoman told Japan
NRG. Like its first test, a small dose of ammonia gas stored in the denitrification facility inside the
plant premises will be used for co-firing.
•  The company’s first co-firing test took place at the Reihoku coal power station in April this year.

•  The Matsuura plant will be Japan’s fourth coal plant to conduct ammonia co-firing.


ANRE, Ammonia Association begin writing ammonia safety rules
(Japan NRG, July 11)
•  ANRE and the Clean Ammonia Fuel Association launched studies to write safety rules for ammonia
use in power generation.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  ANRE will write rules related to power generation; likely to be METI ordinances that supplement
the Electricity Business Act. ANRE said the usual process of writing safety rules takes two years, but
it outsourced the studies to shorten the process.
•  The Clean Ammonia Fuel Association will write rules related to ammonia storage.
•  The officials didn't clarify when the proposed rules will be open to public consultation.
•  CONTEXT: Ammonia power generation rules are needed as JERA plans to commercialize

ammonia-coal co-firing in 2027. Presently, Japan’s annual ammonia consumption is 1 million tons,
and they are kept in small storage tanks of several thousand tons. JERA alone is expected to
consume 0.5 million tons/ year and demand is expected to rise to 3 million tons/ year by 2030. A
lack of clarity in the safety guidelines for large tanks deters the building of bigger tanks that can
hold tens of thousands of tons of ammonia.
• TAKEAWAY: In theory, Japan has 22 GW of ultra-supercritical (USC) grade coal capacity suited for ammonia

co-firing. However, local power utilities have different approaches to introducing ammonia. Chugoku Electric
conducted the country’s first co-firing test in 2017, but has removed the test equipment and has no immediate
plans for ammonia. J-Power is focused instead on coal gasification technology. Meanwhile, Kansai Electric is
developing hydrogen-fired power generation at its thermal power facilities.

INPEX starts work on pilot blue hydrogen and ammonia plant
(Company statement, July 12)
•  INPEX began construction of the country’s first pilot blue hydrogen and ammonia production plant
in Kashiwazaki City, Niigata Pref.
•  Natural gas from the company’s Minami Nagaoka gas field will be used as feedstock, and the
carbon captured will be injected into a nearby storage facility. Also, INPEX plans to generate

electricity and ammonia using blue hydrogen.
•  The plant starts trial runs in March 2025 and will be completed by autumn that year.
•  Following the pilot, INPEX expects to build a commercial grade facility in Niigata and bring it on-
line before 2030.

IHI awarded pre-FEED contract for ammonia production in New Zealand
(Company statement, July 12)
o  IHI was awarded a pre-FEED (Front-End Engineering Design) contract by Woodside
Energy to assess the manufacturing and export of ammonia in Greenpoint and Tiwai

Point in New Zealand's Southland.
o  The project aims for annual ammonia production of 500,000 tons, using electrolysis powered
by renewables, primarily hydropower. By switching to ammonia produced from renewables,
CO2 emissions in the supply chain can be reduced.
o  IHI and Woodside Energy will explore the potential of establishing an ammonia supply chain

Orix Bank begins financing ¥400 billion for renewable energy and logistics projects

(Nikkei Asia, July 14)
•  Orix Bank, a Japanese lender, will extend ¥400 billion to domestic renewable energy projects in
FY2023, to diversify its portfolio away from real estate. Orix will also target disaster prevention and
recycling projects.
•  Over the past two years, Orix provided ¥240 billion to logistics centers in Japan.
•  Of the ¥400 billion this year about ¥360 billion will be securitized and sold to insurance companies,
regional financial groups, and other investors.

•  Over 80% of Orix’s outstanding loans are in investment properties, and repayment periods last
over 30 years. By shifting away from real estate, the bank aims to reduce its depressed asset
efficiency.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT

METI Minister Nishimura visits Fukushima NPP ahead of water release

(Nikkei, July 10)
•  METI Minister Nishimura inspected the Fukushima Daiichi NPP and confirmed safety measures for
the release of treated water into the sea, scheduled for August.
•  The goal is to start the release during the summer, but no specific date is decided.
•  He urged TEPCO to prioritize safety and to communicate with locals, especially the fishing
industry.
• TAKEAWAY: While the scientific consensus on the safety of the Fukushima water release is nearly unanimous,
concerns are growing about the impact that negative rumors and criticism might have on businesses in the

region. Hong Kong, for example, has already threatened to ban import of all seafood from 10 prefectures of
Japan – but later promised to consider easing the measure if the discharge plan was proved to be safe.
Meanwhile, domestically the head of the junior ruling coalition partner, the Komeito party, suggested that
treated water should be released after the bathing season ends, so as to avoid unwanted controversy. Minister
Nishimura said the govt is ready to compensate businesses affected by negative rumors.

Toshiba and GE plan to form 100-strong company supply chain for offshore wind turbines
(Nikkei, July 15)
•  Toshiba and General Electric (GE) plan to jointly establish a domestic supply chain for key
equipment for offshore wind turbines. Toshiba will recruit about 100 small and medium-sized
companies, mainly in Akita and other areas where offshore wind power is being promoted, and
provide comprehensive support from component development to manufacturing.

•  CONTEXT: Dozens of manufacturers in Japan left the wind equipment sector in the last five years
or so as development of the power source struggled. The govt has pushed for offshore wind in
particular in recent years to be a pillar of Japan’s renewables development.
•  Toshiba aims to establish a supply network for wind power generation drive units called "nacelles,"
with the goal of domestic production by 2026. The nacelle is equivalent in size to a three-story
building, and is equipped with a speed booster, brake, generator, and other components, with the

number of parts required numbering in the thousands.
•  Toshiba will host briefings for local SMEs to recruit them into the supply chain. Procurement may
start in FY2025. This will help Toshiba provide maintenance and repair services for the turbines.
•  Toshiba will assemble nacelles at Keihin Works (Yokohama City), with an annual assembly capacity
of about 80 units.
• TAKEAWAY: The govt has set a target of boosting the share of local offshore wind parts and components to
60% of total on a value basis. This stated goal is to lower the cost of building wind turbines and sighting them

in Japan. However, localization of the supply chain has not helped all countries to optimize costs. For example,
Taiwan’s efforts have made locally built turbines more expensive. Still, from Japan’s point of view, creating a
local supply chain is also an energy security issue. Given the importance of the latter, we expect the govt to
provide ample support for such supply-chain-building initiatives.



METI set to take action against utilities involved in cartel issue
(Denki Shimbun, July 11)
•  METI is expected to take administrative action against the electric utilities involved in the cartel
scandal. The five companies are KEPCO, Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric, Kyushu Electric, and
Kyuden Mirai.
•  The Ministry, along with ANRE, has listened to the utilities' defense and will consult with the

Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC).
•  If a business improvement order is issued, the operator will have to establish an internal evaluation
system led by an external majority and implement rules for interaction with other retail electricity
providers.
•  CONTEXT: If ordered to improve operations, this will be the third such case, following previous
actions against KEPCO for financial misconduct and leaks.

reconfirm TEPCO's eligibility to operate the plant.
•  Until inspection is completed, the plant won’t be allowed to restart Units 6 and 7. The inspection

will focus on whether TEPCO is adhering to security regulations and will also involve reviewing
records and exchanging opinions with management.
•  The Commission's decision in 2017 to grant TEPCO eligibility for Units 6 and 7 won’t be
overturned, so the inspection is primarily a confirmation process.
•  CONTEXT: The plant had previously faced issues related to anti-terrorism, leading to a corrective
action order. Some anti-terrorism issues still need to be addressed, and TEPCO aims to make

improvements by late July.
• TAKEAWAY: Local officials and residents expressed concerns and suggested alternative entities to operate the
plant, citing doubts about TEPCO's safety culture. TEPCO must now face both the NRA inspections and
distrust of its management. Many people seem to be more skeptical of the company than of nuclear power.

• Arguably the most important thing to note, however, is that the three-month NRA inspection means TEPCO’s
hopes for an October 2023 restart are now completely in tatters. Realistically, if the inspection goes well, the
time needed to prepare for a restart means the units would come online mid-winter 2023/24, at the earliest.



Number of power retailers continues to shrink amid subdued demand; Tokyo Gas doing well
(Denki Shimbun, July 10)
•  The number of officially registered power retailers in Japan dropped by 19 to 659 companies in
February 2023 compared with a month earlier; of those, the number of firms that actually engage
in electricity sales and supply declined to 511, a drop of 14.
•  One factor behind the shrinking of the market was a general trend of subdued demand in January

and February compared to an average year. The volume of power sold by new entrants to the
Japanese market since 2016 (shin denryoku) was down 4.9%.
•  The best performer in power retail was Tokyo Gas, which expanded its market share and volumes
to top the supplier rankings for the second month in a row. The gas company’s effective marketing
strategies and customer satisfaction are cited as the reasons.


Heat stroke alert for Tokyo area; Utilities coped with demand surge

(Japan NRG, July 10)
•  On July 10, temperatures reached 38.3°C in Sano City, 36.5°C in central Tokyo. Other areas also
saw temperatures 7 to 8 degrees above normal. The MoE and Japan Meteorological Agency
issued a heat stroke alert, calling to avoid unnecessary trips outside and using air conditioning.
•  Despite the rise in temperatures, power facilities have coped well and not registered a huge spike
in demand. In the most populous Kanto region, the consumption rate over the last week surpassed

the 90% rate during peak demand times for only three days in a row, according to TEPCO data.
•  Most of the other days in July, the demand rate stayed within the 80-89% range. Overall, this data
was similar to the same month in 2022, when the rate surpassed 90% only for the first three days of
July and on other singular days.
•  Tokyo temperatures are forecast to cool by 4-5 degrees Celsius from July 19 onward.

Additional environmental assessments required for offshore wind projects
(New Energy Business News, July 11 & 13)
•  The MoE asked Cosmo Ecopower to conduct additional assessments for its plan of 1 GW Hiyama
Offshore Wind Power Station off the coast of Setana and Kamino-kuni in Hokkaido where the

company plans to install 100 turbines (each 10-20 MW). The goal is to help protect rare bird
species.
•  Similarly, Japan Renewable Energy was asked to review its environmental assessment for the
Kimotsuki (onshore) wind project to protect rare species. Total project capacity is 43 MW.
•  CONTEXT: Japan launched an ambitious campaign to develop wind power towards achieving 140
GW capacity by 2050. However, several of the projects are stalled due to concerns over
environmental issues and/or local opposition. Despite plans to expand wind power capacity, the

govt seems to be more cautious when reviewing environmental assessments in order to avoid
potential conflicts.

Reserve power framework takes shape; Start date and procurement volume to be discussed
(Denki Shimbun, July 14)
•  The overall framework for the "reserve power capacity system" is beginning to take shape,
although the start date and procurement volumes remain under discussion.
•  The concept of reserve power involves having alternatives to ensure a stable and uninterrupted

power supply in case of emergencies or disruptions to primary power sources. The application
period for the backup power system is set at a basic duration of 2 to 3 years.
•  While progress has been made in defining the general structure and requirements, two key points
still require work: 1) start date of the reserve power initiative and 2) the volume of power
procurement.
• TAKEAWAY: As well as deciding the issue of power reserves and energy security, this system will have a

considerable impact on the financial performance of the big power utilities. That’s because generation
companies with designated reserve power sources are eligible for compensation to cover costs required to
maintain the dormant state. Short-term reserve capacity is expected to supply electricity through kilowatt
auctions that seek power supply a few months in advance. Meanwhile, facilities that could serve as reserve
capacity over the long-term will likely participate in additional auctions in the capacity market.

Reformed Round 2 Offshore Wind Power Generation Tender
Atones for the Furor from Round 1

More than 18 months have passed since Japan announced the results of its first
tender for offshore wind farm licenses. That first experience, in December 2021,
ended with an uproar among the many firms that felt the process was less than fair
because Mitsubishi Corp-led consortiums won all three fixed-bottom turbine tenders.

Taking into account that experience, the government instituted a number of reforms
hoping to improve the tender process by making it more transparent and competitive.
Bids for Round 2 closed on June 30, and so far the industry reaction is more upbeat.
Results will be announced before March 2024.

While over 20 companies and consortiums submitted environmental assessment
reports for Round 2, this does not mean they’ll all bid. The government asked bidders
not to disclose any information, including if they went through with an official bid or
not. Still, if the number of consortiums that submitted the reports translates into
bidders, it would mean a two-thirds increase for Round 2 compared with the initial
auction. It would also see at least 15 new faces among the bidders, bolstered by much
stronger interest among domestic players.

Japan’s decarbonization strategy envisages offshore wind becoming a significant
source of energy on a scale that squeezes fossil fuel generation to a minimum and
overtakes domestic nuclear capacity. METI calls for installing as much as 10 GW of
offshore wind capacity by 2030 and up to 45 GW by 2040, with a gradual shift to
turbines that float in deep water, as opposed to those fixed to the ocean floor.

However, the Japan Wind Power Association (JWPA) has even more ambitious plans.
At the end of May, it unveiled its “JWPA Wind Vision” for 2050, calling for 140 GW of
wind power, of which 40 GW would be from onshore wind and the rest from turbines
in the nation’s waters. If these plans are realized then Japan would source one-third of
its total power demand from wind.


Background
Why is offshore preferable for Japan? As one of the world’s most densely populated
countries, land rights and community activism are major hindrances in developing
onshore wind. Also, while the distance from shore and deep waters means the cost of
offshore is higher, one major advantage is the higher capacity of sea-based projects.
Winds are also stronger offshore.

Nevertheless, as of 2022 offshore wind still accounts for less than 1% of total global
power generation, with a capacity of 64 GW. Three countries account for almost 75%
of the total — 26.5 GW in China (49%); 13.6 GW in the UK (22%); and 8 GW in
Germany (13%). The UK’s Hornsea Project is the world's largest offshore wind farm,
with two constituent parts that have a 2.5 GW total capacity.

Japan barely makes the Top 10. But if the country realizes its ambitious plans, then by
2040 it could easily emerge as one of the top three offshore wind power generators in
the world.


Round 1 recap
Mitsubishi swept all three projects by offering the cheapest generation bidding rate.
This was possible because the trading house has corporate PPAs with Amazon, NTT
Anode Energy, and Kirin to sell electricity after the projects’ feed-in-tariff (FIT) period
ends 20 years on from the start of operations. While Mitsubishi faced losses in the
initial phase of the project, the company believes it will profit over the longer run.

Round 2
Mitsubishi is noticeably absent from Round 2 bidding. After it made a clean sweep of
three fixed-bottom tenders in Round 1, the rules were changed, making it less
attractive for the trading house to join Round 2. The company is also said to be keen
to focus on building the projects it has already secured.

Given the furor over Mitsubishi’s success in Round 1, and the many complaints from
both domestic and international players, METI paused further auctions for over a year
in order to discuss how to change the rules going forward.

After substantial debates among industry experts, academia and state officials, the
rules were updated for Round 2. The changes are aimed at attracting a diversity of
winners and making sure there is an incentive for projects to be completed on
schedule.

• Bids were capped at ¥19/ kWh for Akita (both projects) and Niigata; and ¥29/
kWh for Nagasaki, due to the area’s more complex geological structures
• “Zero Premium Standard” was introduced
• As well as the offered prices, officials will focus on project feasibility and ability to
complete on schedule
• 1 GW was the maximum capacity that one company or consortium could bid on

Other facets that judges will look at include the bidder’s proposals regarding a stable
supply of electricity, the various contributions their projects will make to the region
and local governments, the financing, and collaboration with local fishermen and port
authorities, as well as the overall economic impact and O&M planning.

The 1 GW cap means that a single company cannot win a clean sweep of all the
projects. For example, if a company bids for the Niigata Project, it will have to forgo
the other three areas. By the way, since Niigata’s generation capacity is the largest,
the government intends to start its operation before June 2029.


What’s next?
Last time, there was a gap of about seven months between the bid deadlines and
results announcement. For Round 2, there’s a similar number of projects and capacity
on offer, but the number of applications is higher by as much as two-thirds. That could
extend the bid review process compared with Round 1, though the government is
committed to publishing results before April 2024, which is 9 months after the bidding
deadline.

As far as the planned Round 3, METI hasn’t announced any details, but many
interested parties are already expediting plans to join by going ahead with their own
area assessments. If the government can keep up the current schedule, auctions will
become an annual event or even more regular. That would expedite the capacity
made available, helping to satisfy the vast interest from businesses. In return, it should
lead to lower costs as greater experience and volumes lead to optimization.

Whoever wins Round 2, there will clearly be a large number of firms that do not
succeed this time. For the government to keep the momentum going and retain high
international interest in Japan’s offshore wind developments, it will need to tread
carefully to anoint a variety of winners and also make sure new auction rounds come
quickly to offer new opportunities.

Japan’s Climate Tech Scene: Govt Plans Indicate Growth Potential

(This is Part 2 of a two-part series about Japan’s climate-tech/ clean-tech sector. Part 1
appeared in the May 29, 2023 edition of the Weekly)


The primary vectors stipulated in the government’s action plan on economic
revitalization indicate that climate tech is finally going mainstream in Japan. And while
big business will be heavily involved, some of the most vibrant innovations in the
technologies and services aimed at tackling climate change are carried by a wave of
new startups.

In June, Prime Minister Kishida’s Cabinet approved an updated version of the “Grand
Design and Action Plan for a New Form of Capitalism,” which will determine the
country’s economic trajectory. The update includes a reference to climate-tech in a
chapter on the overall promotion of startups, underscoring the potential that this
technology could play in the energy transition.

Climate tech is a rather wide field, and includes innovations in a whole range of
economic sectors: manufacturing, engineering, power generation, transportation, and
the digital services sectors. To help accelerate R&D across the economy, the
government has unveiled a five-year plan to encourage new ventures, supported with
a ¥1 trillion budget and easier visa regimes for entrepreneurs, among other actions.

Though Japan’s climate tech scene is still in its infancy, there are promising startups
across a number of sectors. Companies in nuclear fusion and carbon accounting have
been making headlines with new funding and business deals, but other areas such as
agritech are seeing a number of ventures with much potential. We examine some of
the leading names in the Japanese scene and the investment funds involved.


Popular climate tech sectors
Most of the Japanese startups involved in climate tech can be broadly classified in five
areas. Note that the Clean energy sector includes nuclear fusion and renewable
energy. Carbon tech covers technologies related to CCUS and carbon accounting.

Climate tech sector         Example of startups in this sector

Carbon tech            Asuene, Zero Board, e-dash, booost, Aakel
Foodtech                    Regional Fish, Farmnote

Clean energy      Nuclear fusion: Kyoto Fusioneering, Helical Fusion, Ex-Fusion
Transportation                   Rexev

Water solutions                  Wota

| Climate tech sector | Example of startups in this sector |
| --- | --- |
| Carbon tech | Asuene, Zero Board, e-dash, booost, Aakel |
| Foodtech | Regional Fish, Farmnote |
| Clean energy | Nuclear fusion: Kyoto Fusioneering, Helical Fusion, Ex-Fusion |
| Transportation | Rexev |
| Water solutions | Wota |

Two of the more interesting startups with potential for global reach are Regional Fish
and Kyoto Fusioneering.

Regional Fish, founded by Kyoto University and Kinki University professors, develops
next-generation aqua farming systems that use genome editing technology for the
high-speed breeding of fish. It was the only Japanese company featured in the 2023
APAC Cleantech Company Map that’s published by Cleantech Group.

Kyoto Fusioneering (KF) is a spin-off from Kyoto University and was established to
carry out R&D of solutions needed for the development of nuclear fusion energy,
which promises an endless supply of clean energy if experiments will ever be
successful. In May, KF raised ¥10.5 billion ($79 million) in a series C round from 17
investors, including JIC Venture Growth Investments, INPEX, Mitsubishi and a unit of
Kansai Electric. (For more information about nuclear fusion in Japan, see the Oct 11,
2022 issue of Japan NRG). The company has offices in the UK and the U.S.


Govt grading
Picking out promising startups in any area can be tricky. To make the process easier
and to help startups in climate tech gain more prominence, the government has
created an awards program to highlight some of the innovations taking place.

Since 2021, the MoE has awarded the honor of “Most Promising Environmental
Startups” to companies active in a range of fields, from agritech to water purification
to data visualization to reduce GHGs. While there is no monetary prize for the
winners, the event provides opportunities for them to connect with investors and

Financing
The lifeblood of any startup is its ability to raise funding as it develops its product. In
this regard, Japan has traditionally been slow to the global tech startup boom.
However, the situation is changing as more financing mechanisms and funds have
emerged in the last two-three years.
Across the entire economy, a record ¥877 billion was raised by Japanese startups last
year, according to Bloomberg, citing data from INITIAL, a government-linked platform
that offers information, analysis and support for new ventures.
Specifically in climate tech, one of the standout capital accumulations came earlier this
year when Mitsubishi Corporation, the largest trading house, announced the launch of
the Marunouchi Climate Tech Growth Fund. This was a clear sign that the investment
appetite for new climate technologies among Japan’s most powerful corporations is
on the rise. (For more information about Mitsubishi and its fund, see the May 29, 2023
issue of Japan NRG)

Mitsubishi’s fund isn’t the first major investor in climate tech startups, however. It was
preceded by other funds such as:

1. In 2019, Japan Energy Fund (JEF) was established to invest in European and American climate
tech startups. Today, it counts Enechange, Biprogy, Toshiba and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank as
partners. With total funds of $50 million, JEF has invested in technologies such as battery storage,
smart meter data analysis, and demand response. It aims to bring the tech of its portfolio
companies to Japan to contribute to the nation’s decarbonization efforts.

2. KDDI Green Partners Fund - Telecommunication giant KDDI set up the fund in 2021, along with
SBI Investment, to support startups working on climate change technologies. The plan is to invest
¥5 billion for 12 years to 2033. It has so far invested in six companies including Helical Fusion,
Biome and Lebo Robotics, which develops maintenance robots for wind turbines.

3. ANRI-Green No. 1 Fund - ANRI is an independent venture capital fund, and it launched this green
fund in 2022 to invest in climate tech startups. The plan is to raise a war chest of ¥10 billion.
Japan Investment Corporation (JIC), Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (JAPEX), K4 Ventures are
among the other investors.


Academia and government roles
In addition to the accolades, the MoE supports entrepreneurs and investors by
developing a financial framework to promote investment in climate tech companies. In
March, the ministry hosted the first meeting of experts to discuss how to assess the
environmental impact of any new technology that a climate tech startup might have to
offer.

By autumn, MoE’s panel of experts is expected to develop a framework to help
investors and startups assess the potential for CO2 emissions reductions pre-
investment, and manage reductions post-investment. This came as Kishida’s
government designated 2022 as the kick-off year for startups across various sectors in
order to boost the economy.

According to the action plan revised in June, Japan has an annual 4.4% startup rate –
which is the percentage out of the total for all new businesses in a given year. This is
far lower than the U.S. figure of 9.3%, and 12.4% in the UK. The percentage of
businesses that close down in a given year out of the total in Japan is 3.1%, also lower
than 9.4% in the U.S. and 11.1% in the UK. Countries with higher rates of starting and
exiting a business have a higher economic growth rate per capita.

By 2027, Japan aims to boost investment in startups more than 10 fold, to ¥10 trillion,
up from the current ¥800 billion. Another goal is to increase the number of tech
‘unicorns’, which are privately-held startups valued at more than $1 billion, up to 100
from about a dozen currently. Also, another goal is to boost the total number of
startups to 100,000 and thereby make Japan the largest startup hub in Asia.

As for climate tech, METI will take the lead in finding ways to strengthen support and
help develop the proper ecosystems and infrastructure. The government will look into
easing regulations that have remained unchanged for a long time, such as the security
distance for handling substances like ammonia.

Academics also play a key role in boosting entrepreneurship. Industry officials say a
mechanism is lacking to effectively identify and evaluate promising technologies that
universities and research institutes are developing. The government’s action plan calls
for launching a highly specialized campaign – “one research university, 50 startups
and at least one startup exit” – to foster technology entrepreneurship in universities.

The University of Tokyo is among the most active universities. In late June, it hosted
Climate Tech Day, which brought together startup executives and researchers to
discuss the state of climate tech in Japan. Topics of breakout sessions included
Food/Agriculture, CCS, GHG accounting, Mobility, Buildings and Chemistry.


Looking outside Japan for ideas
Since climate tech in Japan has lagged behind other countries, some major investors
have been more active abroad. Billionaire Masayoshi Son’s Softbank Vision Fund
invests in a variety of companies, in large part overseas. One of SoftBank’s climate
tech successes is Plenty, an American startup for vertical farming. (For more
information, see the July 10, 2023 issue)

Japan Energy Fund also says that its main investment targets are European and
American startups, but that might change in light of the government’s growing
interest in new ventures and the climate tech sector.

Perhaps even more crucial is the burgeoning societal awareness over the need to find
viable solutions to the worsening impacts of climate change. Young people, those
under 30, are more attuned to these issues. And it’s precisely that young generation
which is always at the forefront of technological advances and disruption. Japan can
capitalize on this youthful activism and channel its best and most innovative minds in
that direction.

GLOBAL       VIEW

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Africa/ Nuclear power
At the Russia-Africa Forum on July 27-28 in St. Petersburg, a session "Nuclear
Technologies for Africa's Development" will discuss the continent’s current nuclear
projects and potential. The session is organized by Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear
corporation.
Brazil/ Natural gas
Petrobras is discussing seven new potential natural gas contracts as part of efforts to
increase domestic supply. The state oil and gas giant is under pressure to boost local gas
supply from its offshore oil and gas projects and reduce domestic gas prices.

France/ Nuclear power
Nuclear power generation at EDF's French reactors in June rose 12.4% YoY, to 22.7 TWh.
EDF's total nuclear generation in France since the start of the year was 158 TWh, up 2.6%
YoY. This increase is due to the postponement of unit outages.

Germany/ Solar power
Renewables developer and services company MaxSolar secured €410 million for solar
projects in Germany. The financing is provided by institutional investors Infranity, I Squared
Capital and Rivage Investment (France).
Germany/ Wind power
BP will pay €6.8 billion for two licenses to develop 4 GW of offshore wind at two sites 150
km northwest of the Heligoland islands in the North Sea.This increases BP’s global offshore
wind pipeline from 5.2 GW to 9.2 GW, an increase of more than 70%.

Norway/ Oil and gas
Norway’s oldest oil company, DNO, made its biggest hydrocarbon discovery in a decade.
Located in the Carmen prospect in the North Sea, the site’s expected recoverable reserves
is in the range of 120-230 million barrels of oil equivalent.

Renewable energy
Wind and solar projects are on track to account for more than one-third of the world's total
electricity supply by 2030, indicating that the energy sector can meet global climate goals,
according to a report by the Rocky Mountain Institute.

Russia/ oil
Oil exports from western ports are set to fall by some 100,000-200,000 bpd next month
from July levels, a sign that Moscow is making good on its pledge for fresh supply cuts in
tandem with OPEC leader Saudi Arabia.
UK/ LNG
The UK’s biggest energy supplier signed a contract for 1 million tons of LNG a year with
Houston-based Delfin Midstream. When the U.S. project starts production, the deliveries
will heat 5% of UK homes for 15 years.

acquisition also gives ExxonMobil the largest owned and operated CO2 pipeline network
in the U.S.

U.S./ utilities investment
There'll be a “seismic shift” this year in utilities’ investment, said S&P Global. Those with
the highest expected net plant growth, in terms of power producing capacity, are NextEra
Energy at 98.3%, Eversource Energy at 48.3%, Idacorp at 35.6%, Allete at 32.9%, and PNM
Resources at 28.5%.
