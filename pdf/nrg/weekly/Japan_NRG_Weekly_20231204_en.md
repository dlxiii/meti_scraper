COP28: PM Kishida pledges to terminate new unabated coal-fired power plants

(Government statement, Dec 2)
•  At COP28 in Dubai, Prime Minister Kishida pledged to reduce Japan's reliance on coal-fired power
generation, and to terminate new construction of coal-fired power plants that have no emission-
reducing measures in place. He did not specify the timeline or mention the scrapping of existing
plants.
•  Kishida added that Japan plans to enhance financial support for international lenders to aid

developing nations in securing funds to tackle environmental issues.
•  Also, the PM said Japan will help establish a new fund within the African Development Bank, and is
ready to expand loan capacities for the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank by around
$9 billion.
•  CONTEXT: Japan has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Japan will host the first
summit on reducing carbon emissions with ASEAN states later this month, as part of its "Asia Zero
Emission Community" framework.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

JERA confirms it’s on track for 20% co-firing ammonia at coal plant in March
(Company news, Nov 29)
o  JERA President Okuda said the company is on track to meet its March 2024 goal to be
co-firing 20% of ammonia with coal at its 1 GW Unit 4 in Hekinan thermal power station.
o  CONTEXT: The project began in 2021 with small volumes of ammonia at another

Hekinan unit; the goal is to cut CO2. It’s the world’s first test of 20% co-firing at a
commercial plant.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Centrica, Mitsubishi Power to develop Europe's first ammonia-fired power facility
(Company statement, Nov 30)
o  Centrica and Mitsubishi Power Europe inked an MoU to explore development of
Europe's first-ever ammonia-fired power generation facility at Bord Gáis Energy's

Whitegate Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power station in Cork, Ireland.
• TAKEAWAY: Ammonia has a higher volumetric density than hydrogen, making it easier to transport and store.
Also, as a fuel it has no carbon emissions at point of use. However, its production does release emissions if
made with fossil fuels. When those emissions are captured and stored, the ammonia (or hydrogen) is classified
as blue.

METI to write new regulations for carbon transport and storage
(Government statement, Nov 28)
•  Instead of amending current laws on high-pressure gas and mining, METI plans new regulations on

carbon transport and storage safety.
•  To a certain extent, the new regulatory framework will resemble current mining and gas safety
guidelines and procedures. New requirements, such as setting up a third-party technical panel to
advise on technologies, will be added.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
MoE to propose regulatory framework for offshore carbon storage

(Government statement, Nov 28)
o  An MoE panel will propose a regulatory framework for offshore carbon storage; the
public will be invited to comment. The panel is headed by Prof Otsuka Tadashi of
Waseda University.
o  The proposal will address the structure of state oversight, environmental impact
assessment methodologies, and carbon storage in overseas offshore facilities.
o  CONTEXT: The MoE will oversee offshore CCS, following the guidelines of the London

Convention on Marine Pollution; METI will oversee onshore CCS.



Tokyo governor announces plans to launch hydrogen exchange
(FNN, Dec 1)
•  Tokyo Governor Koike Yuriko said that the city plans to launch the world's first hydrogen
exchange.
•  She was speaking at the Local Climate Action Summit, a program at COP28 in Dubai.
•  The Tokyo govt will liaise with global hydrogen organizations to launch the exchange and promote

hydrogen consumption in the private sector, Koike said.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s present hydrogen demand is roughly 170 million cubic meters (14,000 tons),
according to the sole producer Iwatani Corp. Among liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) for
transporting massive amounts into Japan, ammonia is likely to hold the largest share due to coal
ammonia co-firing planned by JERA, Kobe Steel, Tokuyama and Tosoh.
• TAKEAWAY: Large-scale imports of hydrogen in methylcyclohexane (MCH) compounds are expected to start
in 2025 and liquefied hydrogen in 2030. So, the question is, which suits the Japanese market, an ammonia

exchange or hydrogen exchange.

MCH hydrogen carrier set to achieve METI’s target: Chiyoda official
(Japan NRG, Nov 30)
•  Chiyoda Corp is set to achieve METI’s 2030 hydrogen cost target of ¥30/NM3, said Okada
Yoshimi, a research fellow at the company.
•  Okada has developed the key catalysts for the methylcyclohexane (MCH) carrier. Shipping costs

from overseas to Japan using the MCH technology are ¥30-45/ NM3, provided that the cost of
hydrogen is ¥10/ NM3. The costs would vary on travel distances and the availability of legacy oil
facilities that could be used to convert the hydrogen gas into MCH, and back to hydrogen.
•  Chiyoda plans to commercialize the MCH transport system in 2025.
•  CONTEXT: Ammonia and liquefied hydrogen are other hydrogen carriers. MCH’s key advantage is
it can be stored in room temperatures and pressures, and legacy tankers can be used to transport

it. Liquefied hydrogen requires ships with tanks kept at -253 C, and ammonia also requires to be
kept below zero degrees.
• TAKEAWAY: METI supports all three hydrogen carrier options but is likely to offer stronger backing of the
technology that will have more traction in the global market. Chiyoda is forming alliances with overseas
stakeholders and is in talks with Singapore, the Netherlands and 13 other countries to deploy its technology.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Iwatani to install hydrogen capture system at R&D center
(Company statement, Nov 24)
o  Iwatani Corp seeks to improve energy efficiency of hydrogen power, installing hydrogen
capture systems and fuel cell batteries, and integrating them with solar power systems.

o  Its R&D Center has installed 20 units of Panasonic’s 5kW fuel cell systems. The hydrogen
feed for the cells will come from liquefied hydrogen tanks, as well as from the in-house
gas capture system that recovers gasses from tests and boil off processes, and stores
them in metal hydrides.
• TAKEAWAY: The system could be of interest to end-users. Energy is lost when hydrogen is liquefied for
transport and converted back to gas. If the hydrogen capture and storage system recovers a large amount of

the gas, then overall system costs and efficiency will improve.



Hitachi to switch to “decarbonized aluminum” on rising EV demand
(Nikkei, Nov 28)
•  Hitachi will switch to aluminum smelted by hydropower for all its products using aluminum, in
response to growing EV demand.

•  The company sources 10,000 tons/ year of aluminum. It plans to buy the metal from New Zealand
and Brazil.
• TAKEAWAY: A housing or beverage can manufacturer consumes over 10,000 tons each month, so Hitachi is a
small consumer. Still, this is encouraging for hydropower-based aluminum producers that have been marketing
green aluminum in Japan for over a decade with little success. The question is how will aluminum with low-
carbon footprint be priced against Australian and South African aluminum that use coal power. Also, how will

Hitachi and other consumers take into account emissions for shipping from South America, and the carbon
footprint of other materials in the aluminum supply chain.

Toyota Tsusho supplies biofuel to Toyofuji Shipping’s oceangoing vessel
(Company statement, Nov 29)
•  Toyota Tsusho began supplying biofuel for an oceangoing vessel operated by Toyofuji Shipping at
the Port of Nagoya and for a test voyage to Oceania. Before, Toyota Tsusho had only supplied

biofuel to a domestic vessel.
•  The biofuel is waste cooking oil blended with heavy oil.
•  CONTEXT: This follows the company's full adoption of biofuel for its domestic fleet earlier in April.
The biofuel, constituting 24% of the mix with heavy oil, reportedly cuts CO2 emissions by 20%
relative to the sole use of heavy oil. The combustion of biofuel releases CO2 but the plants that
serve as its source can absorb CO2.

Round 18 solar auctions: lowest bid under ¥8/ kWh for the first time

(Japan NRG, Nov 24)
•  OCCTO held Round 18 of solar auctions. The solicited volume was 105 MW; the auction price cap
was ¥9.35/ kWh. There were a total of 61 bids; successful ones were 33, and the awarded capacity
was 177.8 MW.
•  The lowest bid was ¥7.94/ kWh, under the ¥8 level for the first time. The highest was ¥9.19. The
weighted average bid was ¥8.55. The biggest was 25.87 MW.
•  The next bidding, round 19, will offer 134.10 MW of capacity.
•  CONTEXT: In June, OCCTO held Round 16 of solar auctions, when the auction was a unified

system for the first time. Previously, bids were split between FIT and FIP. Round 17 was held in
Aug, and the lowest bid fell under ¥9/ kWh for the first time.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite materials and panel cost inflation, the auctions continue to push down the price of solar
power. Dropping below ¥8/ kWh is a psychologically important level for the govt and industry. Still, the
capacity that gets distributed via auctions is a fraction of the total rolled out. The number of bidders too has
narrowed.





Rapidus chip plant in Hokkaido to need as much as 600 MW of power capacity
(Hokkaido Shimbun, Nov 24)
•  Rapidus says its semiconductor factory under construction in Chitose, Hokkaido, will require
around 100 MW of power capacity when it starts production in 2027.
•  Demand, however, will jump to 600 MW when all four buildings are working at full capacity, a

Rapidus executive said.
•  CONTEXT: Rapidus is a METI-led project with investments from major companies, including
Toyota Motor and SoftBank. The semiconductor factory will have to use only clean electricity
because potential clients, such as global IT majors, demand it.
• TAKEAWAY: The factory will be one of several semiconductor industry facilities in the Hokkaido area and is
likely to be an anchor client for renewables projects, as well as a factor in the restart of the local Tomari NPP.

Also, Rapidus could become an offtaker for a number of new offshore wind projects in and around Hokkaido.

Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI); Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the
Earth (RITE); and Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting.
•  In addition to basic demand estimates for residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, other

factors to be evaluated include advancing energy conservation, electrification, changes in industrial
structures such as steel and automobiles, etc.
•  New technologies, including hydrogen production and Direct Air Capture (DAC), will also be
considered.
•  CRIEPI forecast a 10.1% increase in electricity demand in 2050 compared to 2021 due to
electrification and additional energy-intensive facilities such as data centers and hydrogen

production.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Panel on power futures market holds inaugural meeting
(Government statement, Nov 28)
o  A new METI panel on power futures trading held its inaugural meeting, aiming to make
power futures trading more liquid. This is in response to growing risk hedging needs and

demand management of power suppliers.
o  Prof Ohashi Hiroshi of Tokyo University heads the 10-member panel of power utilities,
commodity brokers and academics. The panel will assess current market conditions and
explore ways to expand trading.
• TAKEAWAY: Robust trades will result from understanding and addressing what exactly market participants
need from futures contracts. If the panel sets a goal of increasing market liquidity, it might fail as it is likely to
hammer out policies reflecting only the interests of big players. Intensive dialogs with market participants of all

tiers and unbiased analysis will be important to gain market trust.

Baseload market - Third session of FY2023, two-year contracts in Tokyo area
(Denki Shimbun, Dec 1)
•  The third round of baseload market trading took place on the JEPX on Nov 30.
•  CONTEXT: This market represents baseload power generated at large hydro, coal and nuclear

stations. It was established in 2019 to help new market entrants, who claimed that EPCOs have an
unfair advantage because they have access to these cheaper baseload electricity volumes. The
market trades four times a year.
•  Trades were based on one-year and two-year contracts. The former was further split into fixed
price and post-adjustment contracts.
•  The total capacity sold via one-year contracts was 36.2 MW in Tokyo at ¥15.4/ kW; 81.5 MW in
Kansai at ¥12; and 6.5 MW in Kyushu at ¥11.76.

•  The two-year contract, which did not trade in the round two session in October, saw trades only for
the Tokyo area this time; 24 MW of capacity was sold at ¥17.07.
• TAKEAWAY: Price and volume variations make it unclear if this market segment is operating successfully.
There are also large variations in pricing between trading rounds, a factor that has been noted by the
electricity market regulator and which may now get more attention.

Iwatani acquires Cosmo Energy stake from activist to become largest shareholder

(Company statement, Dec 1)
•  Iwatani Corp paid ¥105 billion to acquire a 19.69% stake in Cosmo Energy Holdings from
shareholder activist City Index Eleventh and its affiliates. Previously a minority stakeholder,
Iwatani’s stake in Cosmo rose to 19.76%, now the largest shareholder.
•  Pending approval of the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), Iwatani plans to acquire an
additional 250,000 shares from the activist.
•  Iwatani said it can increase value with synergies in hydrogen projects.
•  CONTEXT: Iwatani is Japan’s sole producer of hydrogen and JFTC concerns would be how this

acquisition will affect competition in the FCV filling station segment.
• TAKEAWAY: As Cosmo has a small share of service stations, Iwatani will not gain a dominant market position
in the retail of hydrogen for FCVs. But, if Iwatani sells hydrogen at cheaper prices than ENEOS and Idemitsu,
that could be a legal violation.

Japan to diversify sources as China tightens exports on rare metals
(Nikkei Asia, Nov 28)
•  China now requires export permits for some shipments of graphite, as well as gallium, germanium

and other rare earths. This might impact Japan, which sources over 80% of its natural graphite
(essential for EVs) from China.
•  Mitsubishi Chemical considers increasing electrode material production in China, and explores
partnerships in Mozambique, Norway, and Australia to diversify its graphite supply. Panasonic
Energy and a Canadian graphite company are working on mass production of electrode material.
•  Nissan seeks to source graphite and other vital EV materials from different regions.

it and is a major exporter of both natural and artificial graphite.
• TAKEAWAY: China's decision seems to be a response to U.S. sales restrictions on certain types of technology.

It is expected that China will further restrict rare earth exports, similar to what happened for a few months in
2010. Just like 13 years ago, Japanese companies (which have already stepped up graphite imports,
anticipating a future decline) are focusing on resource diversification. The price of graphite will most likely rise,
especially considering that Russia was a major supplier before the war in Ukraine.

Japan Targets Rooftop Solar PV to Drive Industry Rebound

After almost a decade of rapid growth, solar power installations in Japan have
stagnated. Now the government is determined to revive the market, as local and
national authorities try to engineer an industry rebound with the help of new rooftop
capacity.

Last year, commercial-scale solar projects delivered their lowest installed capacity
since Japan kicked off a renewables construction boom in the wake of the 2011
Fukushima disaster. At the same time, the number of new residential solar arrays has
jumped to their highest level since 2014. The latest data for panel shipments suggests
that this recovery continues in 2023, partly driven by new municipal regulations and
public projects.

Japan was a global leader in solar installations in the early 2010s, almost matching the
capacity brought online by China in 2014 and 2015. Since then, the U.S., and later
India, have surpassed Japan’s volumes. Germany also overtook Japan in terms of new
solar capacity added to the grid in 2022, according to IEA data.

The downward trend is bad news for Japan’s targets to cut emissions and meet its
Basic Energy Plan, which says that solar power should account for about a sixth of the
FY2030 national energy mix. To do that, METI calculated that the solar market must
expand at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 9.2%.


So, with land-based solar projects facing headwinds, officials are turning to rooftops
to lead the charge. This includes new tariffs for rooftop solar. Municipalities led by
Tokyo are also supporting the sector with new programs.

Background
FY2022 installations of solar capacity under the FIT and FIP programs fell to 3.5 GW,
the lowest to date, according to data submitted at the end of October by the Japan
Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA). While some of the new solar projects are
supported by PPAs and other non-FIT business models, even data covering the entire
sector suggests that there has been a slowdown in new capacity rollout over the past
three to four years.

The Association warned METI that without some steps to stimulate the motivation of
solar developers, the number of new projects will continue to decline.

Government officials have found it difficult to turn the tide of discontent amid local
communities towards a number of solar and wind projects in recent years, driven by a
mixture of real and perceived slights. A recent decision by Miyagi Prefecture to
introduce a first ever renewables tax is another challenge for developers, even if the
prefecture officials argue that the main aim of the levy is to prevent deforestation and
engage with communities.

Still, the government has made progress in stimulating demand, targeting roof-
mounted solar systems to be on 60% of new housing by 2030. In January, METI
announced a new FIT specifically designed for rooftop systems. It will offer ¥12/ kWh
for solar power produced on the roofs of corporate buildings from FY2024, which is
about 40% more than the average weighted price secured by developers in the latest
round of solar capacity auctions.

National regulations have taken time to filter through. However, solar panel shipments
are finally on the rise. More than 400 MW of panels were shipped in November, the
most since March 2023. (March orders tend to reflect a last-minute surge in buying
before the start of the next fiscal year from April.)

Official reports on a rise in business activity will come later, but media reports are
already suggesting that sales are supported by PV installations on office and
commercial buildings, as well as condominiums. There’s also been a new wave of local
government initiatives to switch public buildings to solar power and to compel new
houses to install panels.

Municipalities lead the way
In 2012, Kyoto was the first locality to mandate solar panels on rooftops, making it a
rule for all houses of at least 2,000 square meters. In 2022, the requirement was
expanded to cover smaller buildings. In April 2023, Gunma Prefecture introduced a
similar regulation, and now other municipalities are planning to follow suit.

The most ambitious plans today, however, are with the Tokyo Metropolitan
Government. In December 2022, it began to require businesses to install rooftop solar
panels on all large structures, such as office or apartment buildings. This measure
takes effect in April 2025.

Tokyo now produces 646 MW of solar power annually, and it hopes to increase output
by 6% as part of its strategy to halve its emissions by 2030. The city is intensifying
efforts to promote new PV installations with incentives for home developers and by
outfitting its own offices, such as Tokyo Metropolitan Archives that reopened at a new
location in 2020.

Older buildings that cannot support rooftop systems will be modernized so that they
can be equipped with PVs and other energy-saving facilities. This is part of the city’s
commitment to the “ZEB Ready” (Zero-Emissions Building) program. Tokyo will also
require smaller structures, such as detached houses, to install solar panels from 2025.
Buildings account for 70% of the city’s CO2 emissions.

Tokyo has around 2.67 million buildings and houses. However, only 4%, or around
100,000, are equipped with solar panels. It’s estimated that new regulations will lead
to an additional 40 MW or more per year.

The city of Kawasaki, (Kanagawa Prefecture), plans to install solar systems based on
the total floor area, similar to Tokyo and Kyoto Prefecture. Yokohama, ranked as
leader of Asian cities for decarbonization, now requires homeowners to consider a
solar system or other renewables solution in plans for new buildings with a floor area
of at least 2,000 square meters.


Yokohama is working on other ideas. Last month, the city adopted a self-reliant power
system for public schools and their facilities. It reuses solar power generated on the
rooftops of six designated schools, with the surplus transmitted to the Yokohama City
Central Library, which is expected to receive about 170 MWh/ year.

The number of schools will be gradually added, and eventually 25 are expected to
supply around 452 MWh/ year to affiliated facilities. This is around 23% of the
Yokohama Library's annual electricity consumption.

Challenges
One obvious issue with a focus on rooftops is that Japan’s demographics are not in
favor of a continuously growing market. Japan has also seen an apparent decrease in
the number of new buildings since 2018 and that is likely to continue. Rising costs are
also an issue. Based on a recent survey by JPEA, the cost of new systems with capacity
larger than 250 kW is on a downward trend, but prices for smaller installations are not
expected to drop until 2025.

Installing solar panels could raise the price of a detached house by just over ¥1 million
based on a 4.5 kW system, which generates enough electricity for an average
household of four. A 4 kW system usually requires between 16 and 29 panels, or
about 20 to 36 square meters. And while panel prices are down compared with a
decade ago, upfront costs of solar PV is one of the challenges for new buyers.

The rooftop sector has plenty of runway outside of the residential housing. Japan has
7,600 square kilometers of space available on top of and around factories,
warehouses, industrial parks and commercial facilities where solar panels could be
installed, according to the Center for Low Carbon Society Strategy.

METI’s own estimates suggest that at least 5-7 GW of solar capacity could be installed
on the roofs of public buildings, such as hospitals, schools, and government offices.
There’s also potential for additions at airports and railway stations.

To tap into this potential, the government will need to foster expansion of its special
rooftop tariff and also add further incentives for businesses. The emerging carbon
credits market could be one of them.

JERA Boosts Offshore Wind Credentials with Acquisitions and Floating Tech

Many traditional energy firms waver on whether to shift to renewables, arguing that
their expertise lies elsewhere. Japan’s top LNG buyer and biggest thermal utility,
JERA, has decided to pursue both the fossil and renewables route at full tilt. Toward
that goal, it’s following an aggressive expansion strategy in offshore wind, investing in
the sector both at home and abroad.

For a newbie in offshore wind, JERA performed well in the first round of auctions in
Japan, even if it didn’t win. Together with project partners Equinor of Norway and
domestic utility J-Power, JERA’s bids came second in a crowded field for the two big
areas auctioned in Round 1.

To make sure it fares better in the next rounds, JERA has embarked on a M&A drive
to build a stronger team and asset base, echoing the strategy of Mitsubishi Corp,
which won all three of the major auctions in Round 1. It’s also bolstering renewables
staff in-house.

Further down the road, JERA plans to develop home-grown technology for floating
wind projects and quietly support the buildout of solar generation in Japan, while
making a constant stream of investments in Southeast Asian utilities with strong
renewables potential.

Recently, JERA has become synonymous with Japan’s strategy to replace coal-fired
power with ammonia fuel. But the firm has a number of irons in the fire, renewables
being one of them.


Background
Founded in 2015, JERA is a joint venture between TEPCO and Chubu Electric. The
two utilities carved out their coal, gas and oil power stations into the 50-50 venture,
seeking a new home for their thermal power business that was separate from nuclear
and other assets.

Operating these thermal power plants requires purchases of fossil fuel, so it’s no
wonder that JERA almost immediately became one of the world’s biggest buyers of
LNG, handling about 40 million tons of the fuel annually – more than half the import
volumes of Japan.

Despite its advantages in fossil fuel markets, JERA started looking at opportunities in
renewables even before Japan announced a commitment to net-zero emissions.
Planning for entry into renewable energy markets started not long after the company’s
creation, according to Matsuda Ken, the head of Renewable Energy Planning
Department in JERA’s Global Renewable Energy Division.



23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

“Renewable energy is essential for future growth," he emphasized, sharing a
sentiment that is far from universally accepted among major fossil fuel businesses.

The company agreed to acquire 32.5% of the Formosa 1 offshore wind project in
Taiwan in late 2018, when it was still an 8 MW asset. The project then developed into
the first utility-scale offshore wind farm in Taiwan, ramping up to 128 MW of capacity
by December 2019. But even before it was completed, JERA was already busy with
new investments.

A 49% stake in Formosa 2 (376 MW) was announced in October 2019. This deal would
boost JERA’s renewables capacity through its equity holdings to 1.2 GW, the
company said at the time, acknowledging that it was also at an early stage of talks
about an investment in Formosa 3. The latter investment was finally agreed in March
2020, giving JERA a 43.75% stake in a multi-site, 2 GW offshore development near
Taiwan’s central-western coast.

All this happened before Japan announced its 2050 net-zero commitment in October
2020.

In the last year, however, some of this progress has been scaled back. JERA sold its
interest in Formosa 3, citing rising costs and geopolitical uncertainties around the
Taiwan Strait. But this is not a retreat from the sector, the company insists. JERA’s
Global Renewable Energy Division now has 111 members in Japan.


The company continues to own and operate the first two Formosa projects, both of
which are now in operation. The Taiwan market has helped the company accumulate
industry knowledge in a geography that’s close in climate conditions to Japan, say
JERA officials.

Next stage: Japan
JERA took part in Round 1 of fixed-bottom offshore wind tenders in Japan, the results
of which were announced at the end of 2021. The company used the know-how
gained in Taiwan to submit competitive bids that secured second place behind
eventual winner Mitsubishi Corp.

The positives were that JERA’s consortium also managed to offer below ¥20/ kWh,
but it fared poorly in terms of a realistic assessment of its business plan.

Yuihara Atsushi, the head of JERA's Renewable Energy Division's domestic offshore
wind business, admits a certain lack of preparation. "We didn’t quite read all the rules,
and there were more discrepancies than expected in both positive and negative
aspects.”

For Round 2, JERA expects to do better, based on lessons learned from Round 1 and
a closer review of the new tender criteria. JERA also supports the changes to auction
rules. However, Yuihara worries that if Round 3 opens before Round 2’s results are
announced, it won’t be possible to learn from any mistakes.

The government asked Round 2 participants not to disclose information about their
bid. Still, it’s known that over 20 entities submitted environmental assessment reports
for the auction. If all of these turn into a bid, it means a two-thirds increase in the
number of participants from the previous round. JERA once again is collaborating with
Equinor.

Another change for Round 2 is the introduction of the FIP system (as opposed to the
FIT system previously). This seeks to lower the costs shouldered by the public, but
Yuihara says he was still shocked to see the zero-premium price set at ¥3/ kWh.

M&A drive
JERA announced several acquisitions related to offshore wind, seeking to improve the
competitiveness of its workers, bringing in talent that can handle the entire value
chain from development to construction and operation. In July, JERA completed its
acquisition of Parkwind, a Belgian offshore wind farm operator.

Parkwind operates four offshore wind power projects in Belgium (771 MW) and
completed the 257 MW Arcadis Ost in Germany’s Baltic Sea. Parkwind says it has a
further 4.5 GW of projects under development, mainly in Europe. In August, JERA
completed acquisition of Green Power Investment (GPI), a U.S. renewables developer,
from Pattern Energy.

GPI has a considerable renewables asset base in Japan. It owns and operates six
renewables projects totaling 337 MW, and has two projects under construction (192
MW). In 2020, GPI completed the 122 MW Wind Farm Tsugaru (Aomori Pref), then
Japan’s largest onshore wind power plant. The company is also in charge of the 112
MW Ishikari Bay New Port offshore wind farm in Hokkaido that’s expected to be
completed this month.

Floating wind
JERA, together with Mitsui Ocean Development, Toyo Construction, and Furukawa
Electric, has been working to verify the viability of floating wind turbines using the TLP
(Tension Leg Platform) method as part of a NEDO-funded project. Verification of the
technology could start next fiscal year.

The floating structure is meant for depths of more than 70 meters. In the case of 100
meters, the area under the surface can be reduced to 1/1,000th of that of other
mooring methods, and the impact on fishing and ship operations will be reduced.


JERA is doing research off the coast of Ishikari Bay in preparation for a demonstration
with large wind turbines. JERA aims to commercialize the floating technology in the
early 2030s.

Offshore wind offers the size and scale that some traditional energy companies seek in
the renewables arena. However, JERA’s green investments are more spread out than
many realize.

JERA is also:
•  Involved in the 300 MW El Sauz onshore wind power project in Texas.
•  Invested in ReNew Power, one of India’s top renewables utilities.
•  Acquired 35.1% in Gia Lai Electricity (GEC), a Vietnamese renewables
company.
•  Bought a stake in Japanese solar developer West Holdings to jointly develop
1.1 GW of solar capacity.

While some are betting on particular innovative technologies to win out in the energy
transition, JERA has spread its bets widely in the hopes that some, or perhaps all, will
eventually pay dividends.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This new weekly column will replace Global View and will focus on energy events in Asia and those that
directly impact markets in the region.

Asia / LNG prices
Asian spot LNG prices fell this week to a 7-week low despite cold weather, as demand
remains flat and global supply eases. The average LNG price for January delivery into
northeast Asia fell 6% to $15.7 mmBtu, the lowest since mid-October.

Australia / Renewables
Through its Green Investments team, Macquarie Asset Management, has launched
an onshore renewable energy business called Aula Energy. The portfolio has a
projected capacity of 4 GW, with large onshore wind farms in early stages of
development.

Cambodia / Natural gas
Cambodia abandoned plans to build a $1.5 billion, 700 MW coal-fired power plant
and will build an 800 MW natural-gas fired plant instead. Also, the country is mulling
an LNG terminal to supply the power plant.

China / Renewables
By year’s end, China will reach 230 GW of installed wind and solar projects, according
to Wood Mackenzie. Installation this year is more than double the total deployment in
the U.S. and Europe combined, with total investments reaching $140 billion.

Coal power
With the exception of China, in 2023 new coal power plant construction will hit a nine-
year low, with total capacity of just under 2 GW, which is far below the annual average
of 16 GW from 2015 - 2022. Of the 67 GW under construction outside China, as of
July about 84% was in India (30 GW), Indonesia (15 GW), Bangladesh (6 GW) and
Vietnam (6 GW).

India / Energy transition
India needs additional funding of $100 billion to meet its targets under the IEA’s net-
zero emission roadmap that expects the country to triple its target with 32% of its
power coming from solar and 10% from wind by 2030.

India / Coal power
The govt will add 80 GW of thermal capacity by 2032 due to rising demand. Some 30
GW is already under construction. India currently has 214 GW of required coal and
lignite-based installed capacity.

Nuclear power
According to the IAEA, the global total of nuclear reactors - about 400 units - must
double to achieve the Paris climate goals. Ten countries are in the decision phase; 17
in the evaluation phase. A dozen countries will soon join the nuclear power club.
Three are in Asia – the Philippines, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

South Korea / Nuclear power
Seoul signed nine MoUs with the UK on nuclear energy cooperation. One MoU
focuses on collaboration between Korea Electric Power Corp and the UK Atomic
Energy Authority.

Southeast Asia / Renewables
With only 27 GW of solar power and 6.8 GW of wind currently installed, ASEAN
member states still have over 99% of untapped wind and solar power potential, said
think tank Ember, and that the region has potential capacity of about 30,523 GW of
solar and 1,383 GW wind.
