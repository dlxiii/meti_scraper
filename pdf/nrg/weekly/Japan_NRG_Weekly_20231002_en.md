Tokyo GX Week:
Hydrogen Energy Ministerial Meeting (H2EM2023)
(Japan NRG, Sept 25)
•  METI and NEDO hosted the event.
•  In workshops, speakers from around the world presented and discussed the status of hydrogen

industry development and their thoughts on four themes: global status in 2023; H2 standards &
certifications; safety regulations; and finance.
•  The main idea to arise from the conference was that international collaboration is crucial in order to
accelerate supply, demand, and adoption of clean hydrogen. To lower import/ export barriers,
countries need to speak the same industry language – for example, to precisely define what is
“green hydrogen”, and implement universal rules for standards and safety regulations.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Third Asia CCUS Network Forum in Hiroshima
(Japan NRG, Sept 27)
o  METI Minister Nishimura started the conference. In attendance were ministers from
Australia, Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, the U.S., and Vietnam.
o  There were several sessions on CCS opportunities in Southeast Asia: 1) CCS policies and

roadmap; 2) global CCS trends and the goals of the Southeast Asia CCS Accelerator; and
3) CO2 storage activities in Asia.
o  Recently, many countries have started to focus more on CCS and CCUS. Shipping CO2
from countries where storage space is limited to those countries that are more suitable
for storage is seen as cost efficient.
o  Since CCUS is suitable for industries that are heavily reliant on fossil fuels, such as cement

and steel, countries will have to accelerate global partnerships.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Fifth International Conference on Carbon Recycling
(Japan NRG, Sept 27)
o  The conference was held in Hiroshima. In the first session, panelists discussed the role of
carbon recycled fuel (e-fuel), including e-methane. The advantage of e-fuel is that it can

utilize existing infrastructure. However, the negative aspects of e-fuels are high
production costs and determining exactly how much to blend.
o  Production of e-fuels in locations where the cost is low, and then transporting it to
international markets, is seen as a viable cost-efficient strategy.
o  Collaboration among different industries, especially among non-energy related
companies, can help participants to find new insights.
o  The second panel discussion focused mainly on R&D and the technical aspects of carbon

recycling. Featured were new technologies and products that are near to
commercialization or still under development.

GX Week: IEA sees ammonia as potentially dominant hydrogen carrier
(Japan NRG, Sept 29)
•  Ammonia is expected to account for 80% of hydrogen carriers by 2030, the IEA said at the
International Conference on Fuel Ammonia.
•  By 2030, about 16 million tons of hydrogen will be traded internationally.

•  Non-carbon GHGs emissions from combustion, and a lack of hydrogen/ammonia standards are
challenges to establish ammonia as a major energy source, IEA said.
•  As a first step, the IEA proposes an A-to-E scale to classify hydrogen according to its emissions
during production. It will announce details at a later date.
•  CONTEXT: Executives from shipping, glass manufacturing and other sectors expressed their
forecasts for ammonia to replace fossil fuels, adding that there is no perfect solution yet.

Yokoyama Tsutomu, the executive officer of NYK Line, said ammonia was the best candidate for
marine fuel because the industries have the experience with its handling, but safety issues remain.
“We do not rule out any solutions (such as hydrogen, synthetic methane and methanol),”
Yokoyama said.
• TAKEAWAY: Ammonia’s main advantage is that it can be used as fuel for power generation and fuel cells,
without converting it back to hydrogen gas as required for other hydrogen carriers methylcyclohexane (MCH)

and liquid hydrogen. Meanwhile, ENEOS is developing the direct use of MCH for power generation. The
research is conducted in Australia, which has abundant renewables capacity to produce green hydrogen.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mitsubishi mulls converting oil and gas terminal to handle ammonia imports

(Reuters, Sept 29)
o  Mitsubishi is considering whether to convert the oil and gas Namikata terminal near
Hiroshima into a fuel ammonia import hub, the company said at the GX conference.
o  The plan envisages receiving ammonia from potential production projects in Lake
Charles and Corpus Christi on the Gulf of Mexico coast in Texas.
o  Mitsubishi signed an MoU with Swiss-based Proman to study a potential clean ammonia

production project in Lake Charles.
o  Takao Hariya, head of Mitsubishi's next-gen fuels and petroleum division, told the
conference that if successful, the Lake Charles project could be built by the late 2020s
and potentially supply ammonia to Japan.
o  CONTEXT: Japan views ammonia, which could be also produced as a derivative of
hydrogen, as a key element in its net zero transition, and is pursuing this together with
coal in a test project which it hopes to expand nationwide. The terminal currently handles

approximately 1 million tons of LPG and other petroleum products brought in from Japan
and overseas.
o  The Corpus Christi project, which Mitsubishi earlier agreed to study with its partners,
targets first production by 2030 and would have an annual production capacity of up to
10 million tons of clean ammonia. Mitsubishi said its existing LPG storage capacity at the
Namikata terminal could be converted to ammonia tanks, allowing the facility to handle
around 1 mmt of ammonia annually by 2030.

Japan and Central Asian nations to cooperate on decarbonization
(Government statement, Sept 26)
•  Japan and five Central Asian nations (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and
Uzbekistan) announced cooperation to reduce GHG emissions. They established a cabinet-level

dialogue to initiate specific projects.
•  Their joint efforts will focus on promoting renewable energy adoption and improving the efficiency
of aging gas-fired power plants. They pledged to work together on technological and financial
initiatives to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.
•  Additionally, they plan to support the Joint Crediting Mechanism, which reduces emissions in
developing countries using Japanese decarbonization technologies.
• TAKEAWAY: This initiative is meant to mitigate the influence of Russia and China in the region, while opening

new opportunities for Japanese trading firms. Central Asia holds a pivotal position in China's Belt and Road
project.



Chubu Electric files suit against JFTC, seeks to cancel cartel charges
(Company statement, Sept 25)
•  Chubu Electric and its subsidiary Chubu Electric Power Miraiz appealed to Tokyo District Court to
cancel the Japan Fair Trade Commission’s determination that the companies formed price cartels.
•  Chubu Electric was ordered to pay a penalty of ¥20 billion, while Chubu Electric Power Miraiz
faced a ¥7.37 billion fine.
•  On Sept 28, Chugoku Electric also filed a cancellation lawsuit in Tokyo District Court. Kyushu

Electric said in July that it also plans to appeal the cartel charges but has not yet filed the suit.
•  CONTEXT: On March 30, the JFTC charged Chubu Electric, Chubu Electric Power Miraiz, Chugoku
Electric, and Kyushu Electric with cartel behavior regarding power rates. In total the companies
were hit with just over ¥100 billion in fines.
• TAKEAWAY: In the past, the Court has revoked some JFTC decisions on bid rigging. However, when it comes
to cartel cases, the Court has supported all JFTC decisions. The utilities face an uphill battle to have their

charges overturned.


Osaka Gas upgrades flagship hydrogen manufacturing equipment

(Japan NRG, Sept 27)
•  Osaka Gas released HYSERVE-300X, an upgraded model of HYSERVE-300, which separates
hydrogen from mixed gases including propane and biogas.
•  The equipment generates 99.999%-pure hydrogen at 300 Nm3/ hour, which is a world record. The
hydrogen can be used for just about any applications including fuel cells that require 99.99% pure
hydrogen.
•  HYSERVE-300X is about 40% smaller than its predecessor, occupying a floor space of 8x3 meters.

Its price also dropped, although Osaka Gas did not elaborate. Similar equipment typically costs
over ¥10 million.
• TAKEAWAY: Osaka Gas has addressed rising demand for small and economical hydrogen manufacturing
equipment at research laboratories. However, selling the equipment is not easy since many users would be
installing the hydrogen equipment for the first time, and it requires lengthy processes for them to obtain
building facility approvals.

testing hydrogen-fueled power generation at its Keihin Rinkai refinery. Decommissioning work will
start in Sept.
•  From 2020, the Keihin Rinkai refinery has been a test site for processing and using hydrogen from
Brunei. METI minister Nishimura visited the site 10 months ago.
•  CONTEXT: The refinery was a part of a national project to test an international hydrogen supply
chain that converts hydrogen into methylcyclohexane (MCH) at overseas sites, shipping the MCH

to Japan, then converting the MCH back to hydrogen and using it for power generation.



METI and Malaysia’s Petronas in talks for overseas storage of captured CO2
(Nikkei, Sept 24)
•  METI and JOGMEC are in discussions with Malaysia regarding CCS. The goal is to transport and
store CO2 overseas; target launch is 2028.
•  Japan plans to transport CO2 via ships to gas fields owned by Malaysia's state-owned oil

company, Petronas, off the Malay Peninsula.
•  CONTEXT: The global community is working on rules to classify CO2 captured and stored
underground as a "reduction" in emissions. Japan views CCS as a means to ensure stable power
supply and achieve decarbonization. Major investments are needed for CCS, and collaboration
between Japan and Malaysia is seen as a model for CO2 transport in Asia, with European countries
exploring similar possibilities.

Japan, Indonesian companies to study palm oil waste-derived biomethane
(Japan NRG, Sept 25)
•  Osaka Gas, JGC Holdings, INPEX and Indonesia’s PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) will study

producing biomethane using palm oil mill effluent (POME), a source of methane emissions. PGN is
a subsidiary of the state-run oil company Pertamina.
•  POME, which is liquid, is fermented at 35°C to generate biogas, which consists of methane and
CO2, which are separated. The methane will be supplied to local consumers via PGN pipelines.
•  The companies plan to start biomethane production in South Sumatra in 2025. Osaka Gas has
experience in producing biomethane from household waste.
• TAKEAWAY: POME is an ideal biomethane feed as it’s liquid and can be easily fermented compared to

household waste. Outside power sources may not be required for temperature control of POME fermentation
tanks. Indonesia has abundant POME supplies, a byproduct of palm oil. But disposal of POME residue, after
extracting biogas, is yet to be decided.

Tsushima mayor won’t accept literature survey for nuclear waste site

(Japan NRG, Sept 28)
•  Mayor Hitakatsu Naoki of Tsushima City (Nagasaki Pref) refused to accept a "literature survey" for
the selection of a nuclear waste site.
•  Despite the city council's previous decision in favor of the survey, the mayor cited a lack of public
consensus and concerns about reputational damage.
•  The decision met opposition from local groups, including fisheries operators and tourism-related
businesses.

•  CONTEXT: A “literature survey” is the first step in the selection process for a nuclear waste
disposal site, and involves assessing suitability without actual site research. It’s carried out by the
Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO).
• TAKEAWAY: Kishida’s govt is pushing to expand nuclear power and selecting nuclear waste disposal sites is

Japan Ramps up Large-Scale Storage Battery Projects
to Manage Power Curtailment

Japan has seen a spate of storage battery projects announced in recent months. Many
seek to take advantage of state subsidies as central and local governments push for
more renewables. The goal is to encourage the installation of batteries to help the
grid cope with more weather-reliant generation in the system.

As Japan’s renewables sector expands, and both the Capacity Market and Balancing
Market develop, there’s growing demand for grid-scale batteries and onsite units at
solar and wind farms. Most existing battery capacity in Japan is residential.

Large-scale battery storage is vital for modern energy systems, enhancing energy grid
stability and reliability by storing and releasing excess energy to balance supply and
demand. Batteries also facilitate the integration of intermittent energy sources by
storing surplus energy during high production periods and releasing it during low
production, ensuring a consistent energy supply. All of which can reduce the reliance
on fossil fuels.

Keen to ensure that Japan can secure battery capacity as demand for the technology
increases, Prime Minister Kishida’s government is promising to introduce tax breaks
for battery manufacturers. In the mid-to-long term, this should help to lower the cost
of installing the technology at grid and project level. But even at today’s prices and
amid uncertain supply, the capacity of applications of grid-scale battery projects in
Japan is unprecedented.

Background
Since revisions to the Electricity Business Act in May 2022, large-scale battery systems
installed on the grid side can qualify as a power generation business. Along with those
built onsite at individual renewable power plants, these batteries are increasingly
playing an important role as power curtailment is on the rise.

According to METI, grid-scale storage batteries have been rapidly expanding in Japan
over the last two years. As of May, grid access applications for about 12 GW in
capacity have been submitted to power transmission and distribution companies.
That’s not including the grid access applications for 1.1 GW planned capacity that’s
still waiting to sign a contract. Hokkaido and Kyushu have had more applications than
other areas.

The increase in storage battery deployment follows greater power curtailment
frequency in Japan due to solar’s relatively large share in the national energy mix. All
regions — except the Kanto region that’s home to Tokyo and surrounding prefectures
– are now making forecasts for the rate of power curtailment. Meanwhile, METI says
it’s inevitable that curtailment will also start in the Kanto region.

METI plans to come up with additional measures to reduce curtailment by year-end,
and the ministry says that storage batteries are among short-term solutions to help
resolve the issue, along with electrolyzers used to produce hydrogen and heat pumps

since they create demand for electricity. For mid-to long-term solutions, the grid
needs to be strengthened and power demand and supply need to be adjusted
through a price mechanism.

Business models and main players
So far, many of the recently announced battery projects are supported by state
subsidies. In April, 15 battery projects were chosen as recipients of subsidies –
totaling about ¥17 billion – included in METI’s FY2022 supplementary budget; (See a
full list at the end of the story).

That announcement followed the ¥13 billion allocated in FY2021’s supplementary
budget for new battery installations or electrolyzers to accelerate the deployment of
solar and wind power.

Some recipients announced in April include;
• A project by Idemitsu, Renova and Nagase, a trading company of chemical
products, to set up a 15 MW/ 48 MWh storage battery system at Idemitsu’s
former refinery in Himeji city, Hyogo Prefecture. The project received 1.6 billion
yen from METI and the system will launch in October 2025. This marks the first
grid-scale battery project for both Idemitsu and Renova, a developer of
renewable energy projects.
• A joint project between JFE Engineering and S.D.L., a wholly owned unit of
leasing company Tokyo Century, to build a 2 MW/ 8.4 MWh system. It received
¥188 million in subsidies and will start operations in October 2024. The project
will be set up in Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu where curtailment is occurring
more often, and use an automated energy management system to buy and sell
electricity on the wholesale, balancing and capacity markets. JFE Engineering said
the project marked its entry into the grid-scale battery business.

At the local level, in September 2022 the Tokyo Metropolitan Government launched
its own program to subsidize installations of storage batteries to be connected to the
grid in areas covered by Tokyo Electric. In total, Tokyo had allocated a total ¥9.6
billion with a cap of ¥2.5 billion per project. In August, 26 recipients with a total
capacity of 171.6 MWh/ 50.5 MW were announced. The recipients are required to sell
electricity on the wholesale, balancing and capacity markets, or directly to customers.

Newcomers also include a maker of batteries. NGK Insulator has entered the grid-
scale storage battery business, teaming up with Sustech, a Tokyo-based tech
company. They plan to start operations by March 2025 using NGK’S NAS batteries,
and plan to combine two types of batteries, NAS and lithium-ion, to improve the
profitability of battery projects.

Non-Japanese companies also see opportunity. Aquila Capital, a German investment
management company, is looking into a battery storage business in Japan, Alexander
Lenz, chief executive for Aquila’s Asia Pacific region, told Reuters.

Akaysha Energy of Australia, owned by BlackRock, forged an alliance with Itochu in
September to work in the utility-scale energy storage business. The companies said
they will develop energy storage plants in Japan as well as overseas, including
Australia.

Itochu has other projects in the pipeline. It announced in July a plan to build an
energy storage station (20 MW/ 56 MWh) in Fukuoka Prefecture with Tokyu Land
Corp. and Tokyo Century. This followed an announcement in June that the trading
company will work with Osaka Gas and Tokyo Century for an 11 MW/ 23 MWh battery
project in Osaka Prefecture.

Other solutions
Companies are innovating, seeking creative solutions. For example, used EV batteries
are seen as a solution for the recycling of batteries that are sufficient for power
generation. Itochu said in June that it will partner with Kaneka Solar to set up a 1.9
MW/6 MWh battery project in Hyogo prefecture using old EV batteries.

Another example is Sumitomo’s “EV Battery Station Chitose” that also uses recycled
EV batteries. The 6 MW/23 MWh plant in Hokkaido begins operations this year and
will trade electricity on the balancing market and capacity market beginning next year.
Batteries will be supplied by 4R Energy, Sumitomo’s EV battery recycling venture with
Nissan. This will expand the use of old EV batteries, which contain rare metals.
The company plans to develop a total 100 MW of battery projects by March 2027 in
areas such as Hokkaido and Kyushu.

In the coming years, demand for storage batteries will continue to rise in Japan. They
can provide a quick solution to grid congestion because it’s faster and easier to set up
a battery system than build new transmission lines.

However, persistent inflation amid rising energy prices, as well as the weakening of
the yen, will increase the cost of imported materials and foreign-made batteries. In
this context, Japan will need to take the necessary steps to support and develop its
domestic battery production industry, as well as establishing stable and efficient
supply chains.

ANALYSIS

BY FILIPPO PEDRETTI

Japan Bets Big on Developing Carbon Capture in Asia-Pacific

While the future of the energy transition is inherently uncertain, two things have long
been clear to many energy analysts. First, energy demand in Asia Pacific will continue
to grow in the coming decades; and second, this demand will almost inevitably be
met largely by fossil fuels.

Now, thanks to obligations before the global community we can add a third certainty
– Asia Pacific will have to manage its emitted CO2 emissions, finding solutions to
capture and store it.

According to the IEA, overall energy demand in Asia Pacific will grow about 3%
annually to 2030. Nearly 75% of that increase will be met by fossil fuels because the
region’s relatively modest renewable energy expansion is not on course to
accommodate rising demand. By 2050, however, that figure could even reach 90%,
warns ASEAN’s Center for Energy.

Unless there’s a major course change in renewables, carbon capture is left as the only
feasible solution to help Asia reach its CO2 reduction targets. Sensing a tremendous
opportunity, Japan is determined to lead the carbon capture and storage (CCS) effort
and to foster the creation of an Asia-Pacific CCS market. JOGMEC, which for nearly
two decades was tasked with securing oil, gas and mineral supplies for Japan, is now
the country’s chief coordinator for these CCS efforts.

Still, there are a number of obstacles that must be contended with. These include an
absence of common rules and regulations among interested nations in Asia-Pacific, as
well as a lack of proven business history, and challenges in how to transform CCS into
a real and profitable business.


Japan’s CCS projects in Asia Pacific
In February, ANRE released its CCS sector roadmap that calls for Japan to establish
facilities that can store between 6 to 12 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of CO2
by 2030. ANRE assesses the cost of isolating, recovering, transporting, and storing a
ton of CO2 to be about ¥13,000 to ¥20,000.

One of the industry’s biggest catalysts came in June when state energy company
JOGMEC picked seven sites – five in Japan, two abroad – for development as part of
the first wave of Japanese CCS projects. These sites are projected to store around 13
mtpa of CO2, of which 30% would then be exported overseas. JOGMEC envisages
developing more CCS projects outside Japan to create CO2 storage of 120 to 240
mtpa by 2050. The selection of such advanced CCS projects, which is conducted by a
public offering process, is based on the CCS Long-Term Roadmap compiled by METI,
with JOGMEC to evaluate their feasibility and alignment with the target of starting
CCS operations by 2030.

Founded in 2004, the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC),
previously known as Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, was originally

21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

tasked with ensuring a stable supply of oil, gas, and metals for the country. That
mandate widened in 2020 to include CCS; and in 2022, hydrogen and ammonia were
added to JOGMEC’s purview. Today, one of JOGMEC’s main goals is to provide
technical and financial support in the creation of a CCS market in Asia Pacific.

Those CCS research efforts are led by the JOGMEC Technology & Research Center,
which is building on decades of experience in the oil and gas industry to conduct
geological surveys. First in line are ASEAN countries, where JOGMEC is seeking to
identify suitable CO2 storage locations.

In addition, JOGMEC plans to provide equity capital and loan guarantees for CCS-
related asset acquisitions, mergers, etc. This financial support – involving other actors
such as Japan Bank for International Cooperation – will cover costs for capture or
transportation activities. JOGMEC reports that the budget of the current fiscal year is
around ¥3 billion for both domestic and international CCS projects.

Geological potential of Southeast Asia

Agreements regarding CCS were also stipulated during the Asia Zero Emission
Community’s meeting in March, confirming the importance placed on this technology.
AZEC is a collaborative effort led by Japan and joined by ten other Asia-Pacific
countries to accelerate the energy transition and address the challenges of reducing
carbon emissions in the region. AZEC promotes decarbonization, most notably
hydrogen, ammonia, and CCS projects, while recognizing the unique circumstances
and challenges faced by Asian countries.

At the March meeting, JOGMEC and PetroVietnam agreed to develop CCS/CCUS,
building on surveys and assessments that were launched in November 2022. This
collaboration extends an existing partnership in upstream oil and gas development
and CO2 enhanced oil recovery in Vietnam.


22


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

In Indonesia, JOGMEC, Japan Petroleum Exploration (JAPEX) and PT Pertamina plan
to cooperate on a CO2 injection field test at the Sukowati oil field. The test will
evaluate CO2 injection using the Huff & Puff method for enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
and carbon storage.

Further abroad, one of the overseas Advanced CCS Projects selected by JOGMEC is
in Australia where Mitsubishi Corp, Nippon Steel, and ExxonMobil Asia Pacific are
working on plans to annually sequester 2 million metric tons of CO2. The focus is to
serve the needs of steel plants in the cities of Nagoya and Yokkaichi (Japan).

In Western Australia, Mitsui is involved in a CCS feasibility study, exploring low carbon
ammonia production and CO2 storage in depleted gas fields. Also in Australia,
JOGMEC is contributing to the CarbonNet CCS project, partnering with the State of
Victoria to store 5 million tons of CO2 per year for 25 years.

Location for the CarbonNet project

Malaysia is the site of another overseas Advanced CCS Project. Mitsui is leading the
Offshore Malay CCS project, planning to utilize depleted oil and gas fields and saline
aquifers off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. The goal is to store about 2 million
metric tons of CO2 annually, sourced from various industries in Japan. METI and
JOGMEC were also in talks with Malaysia's Petronas to store CO2 captured from
Japanese factories and power plants underground. An MoU was signed on Sept 27 at
the Asia CCUS conference in Hiroshima, aiming to transport and store CO2 in
Petronas' gas fields off the Malay Peninsula as soon as 2028.

Lastly, also in Malaysia, JOGMEC, Petronas, and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration are
researching the development of high CO2 gas fields, using CCS technology, with a
possible goal of exporting hydrogen to Japan.


Longing for profits and a legal framework
Currently, CCS is not a revenue-generating sector. Since financial institutions prioritize
proven technologies and business models with established cash flows, ensuring the
reliability of these projects is crucial to obtaining financing. Securing multiple revenue

23


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

streams is essential to gain international investments, government subsidies, and
financial instruments such as insurance to mitigate risks.

Promoting the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is seen as a way to generate revenue
for CCS projects. Initially focused on providing decarbonization technologies to
developing nations, expanding the JCM to encompass projects that span multiple
countries, including industrialized economies, are being considered to meet the
demands of CCS projects. JOGMEC advocates for a state-backed carbon credit
system to support CCS.

Effective regulation is key to make these technologies impactful in reducing
emissions. Among the Southeast Asian countries under consideration for potential
CCS sites, only Indonesia and one state in Malaysia have established the necessary
CCS-specific legal and regulatory frameworks.

Governments in the region must also establish regulations for geological surveys,
drilling, injection, and monitoring to ensure CCS’ long-term reliability and positive
environmental and social impact. Japan's joint efforts with Australia and Southeast
Asian nations envision unified CCS technology rules, signaling a collective
determination to expedite facility construction and reduce costs.


Competition from China
Nevertheless, there has been strong criticism from certain quarters, such as from the
influential magazine Sentaku, which said that JOGMEC’s rapid expansion into an
unfamiliar territory like CCS raises concerns about potentially accumulating
problematic assets. The belief that CCS is a silver bullet for decarbonization is also
met with skepticism by many environmental activists, as operational CCS projects
worldwide are few and the technology poses significant risks, such as trouble with
injecting CO2 underground and carbon leakage.

Sentaku believes a significant motivation behind JOGMEC's expansion is to protect
METI’s interests in its main areas, such as oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries.
METI's initiatives primarily focus on the procurement and utilization of CO2, which
keeps fossil fueled energy systems alive. This, of course, causes consternation among
activists.

Meanwhile, there’s a geopolitical aspect to this issue. China has made significant
progress in CCS, demonstrating capabilities in designing and implementing large-
scale projects. So, if Japan doesn’t succeed in bringing CCS to Southeast Asia, then
China could possibly do so, further cementing its influence in the region.

Japan has repeatedly stated, especially at recent G7 and AZEC meetings, that the
path to decarbonization in Asia cannot mirror that of western industrialized countries
because it's not feasible to abruptly eliminate fossil fuels energy systems that are
newly built and prevalent in the region. In other words, the Asian path to CO2
reduction and zero emissions seems likely to differ from the one proposed by the EU
and the U.S.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Italy/ Natural gas
Italy is in talks with Bavaria to supply gas and hydrogen, and it also aims to sell energy
to Austria and Hungary. Italy seeks to be an energy gateway between Africa and
Europe, as EU members seek to reduce dependence on Russian gas.

Germany/ LNG
Utility Uniper negotiated a deal for U.S. LNG supply that goes to “the very late
2030s”. Overall, German and European LNG demand is forecasted to grow over that
period. Uniper also seeks opportunities in regas terminals in Germany.

India/ Clean energy
British International Investment, a state finance institution in the UK, plans to invest
about $1 billion in India’s climate-related projects by 2026. Last year, BII invested over
$300 million in India in climate finance, renewable energy, and electric mobility. Its
current portfolio in India is valued at $2.2 billion with investment in over 290
businesses.

Morocco/ EV batteries
China’s CNGR Advanced Material will invest $2 billion to build a cathode materials
plant in Morocco to supply the U.S. and European battery markets. Morocco is a free
trade partner of the U.S. and it has 70% of the world’s phosphate reserves, a key
ingredient in the cheaper, lower-range batteries in which China dominates.
Nigeria/ Oil
Nigeria has secured a total of $13 billion in investment commitments in its oil and gas
sector from major international energy companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and
TotalEnergies.

Philippines/ Geothermal power
Energy Development Corp (Lopez Group) will invest $1.1 billion in geothermal energy
over the next three years, and will drill 40 new wells, many on the main island of Leyte.
EDC operates more than 60% of the country's geothermal generating capacity,
accounting for about 1.19 GW of the company's total 1.5 GW of renewables capacity.

Poland/ Nuclear power
Westinghouse and Bechtel agreed to build Poland’s first nuclear power plant. It will
consist of up to six reactors across that would generate as much as 9 GW of energy.
Poland needs nuclear power to transition from coal, which accounts for 69% of its
national energy mix.

Russia/ Fuel ban
Russia made some changes to its fuel export ban including lifting restrictions on fuel
used as bunkering and diesel with high sulfur. However, the indefinite Russian ban on
all types of gasoline and high-quality diesel remains in place.

Russia/ Oil sales
Russia is selling oil at about $80 per barrel, about $20 above the G7 price cap, traders
say, as tight global oil markets help Moscow. This situation reflects output cuts in mid-
July by OPEC+ producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Saudi Arabia
The country signed an agreement with Greece to link their power grids, eventually
aiming to supply Europe with clean energy. The new company will be called Saudi
Greek Interconnection.

U.S./ LNG
Sempra won federal approval for LNG export expansion on the Texas Gulf Coast.
Phase 1 of the $13 billion Port Arthur project is already under construction. With
approval for Phase 2 now, the facility can increase output from 13 mmt/ year to 26
million mmt/ year.

UK/ Oil and gas
The govt approved one of its biggest new oil and gas projects in years, saying energy
security is a priority. Equinor's North Sea Rosebank field is due to start output in
2026/27. Recently, PM Rishi Sunak watered down plans for the UK’s 2050 net zero
