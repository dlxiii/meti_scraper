Solar to beat nuclear as cheapest power source in 2030: METI expert group

(Japan NRG, July 12)
•  The METI working group on power generation costs published forecasts for 2030; solar is
expected to be the cheapest of 15 different sources of electricity.
•  The cost assumptions didn’t include potential costs associated with the expansion of the power
grid to accommodate more renewable energy capacity. These costs would include adding power
lines and broadening the capacity of interconnectors between regional grid systems.
•  The higher installed capacity would bring down solar costs, while nuclear costs would rise due to

upgrading facilities to meet new “severe accident” safety measures.
•  For thermal energy cost forecasts, the group used coal, oil and gas price forecasts from the World
Bank and other international organizations. The bank expects coal prices to fall from current levels,
while gas and oil would be higher in 2030.

•  CONTEXT: The numbers for offshore wind contrast quite strongly with the forecast for the sector in
the government’s Green Growth Strategy published in Dec. 2020. The government said it wants to
lower the cost of fixed-bottom offshore wind turbine-generated power to ¥8 to ¥9/ kWh by 2030 –
2035. That target is based on a higher ratio of components manufactured in Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: The numbers above are and will be contested by various industry groups, and you can see some

examples in the Side Developments section below. However, it should be noted that the 11-person group is
led by President / Director-General of RITE (Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth), Yamaji
Kenji, who is one of the most prominent voices in the energy policy sphere of Japan, as noted in previous
editions of Japan NRG. See our “Who’s Who in Decarbonization” of Japan in the Dec. 7 and Dec. 14, 2020
issues.

• The immediate reaction to the numbers has been to focus on how solar has “beaten” nuclear generation.
Opponents of nuclear will use this to argue that nuclear no longer deserves its place in the future energy mix.
After all, one of the original rationales for pursuing nuclear was that it was a cheap source of energy. But,
supporters of nuclear do not concede this point, noting that these forecasts do not factor in the cost of
expanding the grid to accommodate the higher percentage of decentralized power (namely, solar and wind).

Thus, they say, the “real” cost of solar and wind is higher.
• What’s interesting about this report, since it’s published on the eve of the new Basic Energy Plan, is that it
indicates where energy trends should go, not where they will go. It also offers plenty of caveats (including in
the utilization rate assumptions) that each energy lobby can exploit to make their case.

• Overall, we expect this to be an oft-referred document that will carry significant weight in government
discussions going forward.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Environment Minister hails new solar cost estimate as “game-changer”
(FNN Prime Online, July 13)
o  Environment Minister Koizumi has lauded a projection that by 2030 solar panels will be

the cheapest method of generating electricity.
o  “We used to think of nuclear power as being the cheapest option. This assumption is no
longer true, and it’s a game changer.”
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI cost estimates are vague on nuclear, ignore solar’s grid price tag
(NRI, July 14)
o  The article sets out the opinions of Nomura Research Institute’s executive and economist

Kiuchi Takahide.
o  Kiuchi criticizes METI’s presentation of the estimates, noting there’s no maximum figure
put on nuclear power.
o  CONTEXT: The report shows some costs as a range while others are given as an “at
least” number.
o  The cost of decontaminating areas affected by the Fukushima disaster, and the new

safety upgrades of NPPs since, mean that METI can no longer claim that nuclear power is
the cheapest form of electricity.
o  However, extending nuclear reactor lifetimes by 20 years will likely make electricity
generation at existing assets cheaper.

o  Kiuchi also has the impression that the estimate for solar costs is deliberately set low to
reassure consumers worried about the impact of renewables on their power bill.
o  He notes that Bloomberg NEF projects that the cost of solar power will remain higher
than the cost of electricity from coal-fired thermal stations until at least 2045.
o  Notably, METI’s numbers do not build in the cost of “buffering” capacity, which is

necessary to absorb fluctuations in output from wind and solar sources. If the soon-to-be-
released revision to Japan’s official energy mix includes increased solar capacity, it’s likely
that the actual generation cost of solar will increase significantly, Kiuchi concludes.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI’s new Basic Energy Plan may keep nuclear as cheapest source
(Sankei Shimbun, July 15)

o  The new national energy vision, due later this month, may retain the view that nuclear is
the cheapest power source for Japan.
o  The higher costs for nuclear in the latest METI calculations are based on the assumption
that new nuclear power plants will be built. That is highly unlikely in the current climate in
Japan. The cost of running existing nuclear plants, whose lifespan is being expanded, is
therefore cheaper than suggested by the recent METI working group report.
o  For solar, costs are likely to climb as the lack of readily available flat land pushes

developers further into mountainous terrain. That makes local residents nervous and this
ultimately pushes up the cost of development.
o  Solar’s other “weakness” is its weather dependence. Backup power must be available to
cover it, and that should be factored into cost estimates.



Bank of Japan unveils plan to boost funding to counter climate change

(Nikkei Asia, July 11 and July 16)
•  Japan’s central bank is creating a new funding scheme designed to support companies that wish to
go green.
•  The Bank of Japan will offer zero-interest loans to commercial banks for up to one year, with a
possibility of rollover until FY2030. Also, the BoJ will exempt commercial bank reserves held at the
central bank from negative interest rates – equal to twice the amount the banks loan out for

climate friendly projects.
•  The scheme encourages financial institutes to provide low-interest loans for companies to invest in
decarbonization. Banks will need to show the BoJ how they plan to use the borrowed funds.
•  The new scheme will be implemented by the end of this year.
•  Still, some in the private sector are concerned that the rates offered by the BoJ are not attractive
enough to make a difference.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

BoJ to purchase foreign currency-denominated green government bonds
(Nikkei Shimbun, July 16)
o  The Bank of Japan announced its Climate Change Imitative Policy. Among other things,
it plans to assess how climate change impacts the economy and markets, and verify that
financial institutions can cope with these changes.

o  The bank intends to proceed with the purchase of foreign currency-denominated green
government bonds and also to “green” its own assets.
o  The bank will also push for better information disclosure on climate risks in Japan and
support “transition finance” – fund-raising by companies that want to decarbonize and
lower emissions.



Japan mulls dropping 60-year limit for operating nuclear reactors

(Nikkei, July 16)
•  The government is considering dropping the current restrictions on the operating life of nuclear
reactors. Current rules offer initially a 40-year license, which can be extended by 20 years after an
application from the operator to the industry regulator.
•  With the prospect of building new nuclear plants dim in the current climate, this would offer a way
to run the equipment for an unlimited period, providing it meets safety and regulatory criteria.
•  The next Basic Energy Plan is expected to discuss the issue of expanding operating life of reactors.

A ministry working group would then take up the issue for discussion.
•  Changing operating lifespans would require an amendment of current laws. It is expected that if
this does go ahead, additional safety measures will also be part of the amendment.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Share of renewables to be at 36-38% in the new Basic Energy Plan
(Nikkei, July 17)

o  Nuclear’s share will remain at 20-22%, which supposes that all 27 reactors that have
applied for a restart are operating
o  Thermal generation’s share will drop to 41%
o  Ammonia and hydrogen generation will get 1% of the mix
• TAKEAWAY: The percentages have been leaked previously and seem to be the same as reported earlier.



METI group unveils roadmap for developing materials that utilize captured carbon

(Japan NRG, July 15)
•  The Green Innovation Project working group, which operates under the METI umbrella, unveiled a
roadmap for developing materials produced with CO2 that’s collected through carbon capture
technology. This includes concrete, efficient plastic-to-plastic recycling system, and other ideas.
•  The group wants international standards for materials that recycle carbon by 2030.
•  Experts noted that work is under way to study the properties of raw materials used to make
concrete. Meanwhile, the petrochemical sector aims to start test runs of a low-carbon naphtha unit
by around 2030, and also to promote plastic-to-plastic recycling.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Tokyo Gas and Kashima to jointly develop CO2-absorbent concrete
(Gas Energy News, July 12)
o  Tokyo Gas and Kashima will jointly develop manufacturing technology for CO2-
absorbent concrete using CO2 contained in exhaust gas of city gas appliances.
o  This is the world's first attempt to manufacture concrete using exhaust gas from gas

appliances. The companies hope to make the tech commercially viable.

o  CO2 can help to reinforce precast concrete products such as foundation blocks for solar
power generation equipment and pedestrian road boundary blocks.


Panel studies framework for sharing imbalance settlement revenue

(Japan NRG, July 12)
•  Electricity and gas systems panel mulls a framework to share and distribute proceeds from the
power imbalance settlements collected by network system operators.
•  From April 2020 to Jan. 2021, power network operators collected ¥56-¥66 billion.
•  METI proposed a scheme to pass the money back to network users as a whole as a consignment
fee, rather than providing funds to specific companies. The panel will study if current regulations
would allow operators to cover their losses for past years.




METI picks electricity price pilot projects ahead of the aggregation scheme launch in 2022
(Japan NRG, July 14)
•  Dynamic pricing, diversified energy resources, and combining renewable energy sources are the
themes chosen for 2021 pilot projects by METI ahead of next year’s launch of the aggregator
licensing system.

•  Project participants include Idemitsu, Kansai Electric, Waseda University and SB Energy. Idemitsu’s
group will use its pilot project to study if moves in wholesale electricity prices could be used to
even out demand.
•  Kansai Electric and Waseda University will study how diversified energy resources could be
combined and linked to imbalancing and capacity markets.
•  SB Energy will study combinations of various renewable energy sources.
•  The government has said it will finance aggregation scheme studies. This year’s budget allocation

for this is ¥4.52 billion.



Kyocera develops energy harvesting buoy in variant of tidal power
(New Energy Business News, July 16)

(Kankyo Business, July 9)
•  Toyo Engineering will join the second phase of a project by Russia-based Irkutsk Oil Company,
JOGMEC, and Itochu Corporation to establish a “blue ammonia” value chain stretching from
eastern Siberia to Japan.
•  The parties will work together on a concept for producing hydrogen and ammonia from natural gas

sourced from Irkutsk’s East Siberian oil wells, and consider the use of rail and pipelines to transport
ammonia overland.
•  Toyo and Itochu were commissioned by JOGMEC to devise a master plan for a value chain for the
conversion of Siberian natural gas to ammonia and the transportation of this ammonia to Japan.



Tokyo Gas to trial new methanation technology in Yokohama

(New Energy Business News, July 13)
•  Tokyo Gas plans to begin trialing new methanation technology in Yokohama in 2021/2022, and
hopes to gain expertise in producing synthetic methane from renewably-generated electricity.
•  In addition to utilizing the traditional (catalyst-based) Sabatier process, Tokyo Gas will trial the
newer “hybrid Sabatier” and “bioreactor” processes to boost efficiency and reduce expenses.
•  Tokyo Gas will use ITM Power’s polymer electrode membrane electricity process to provide the

hydrogen required for methanation. This will also enable it to produce methane using locally
produced, renewable electricity.

Idemitsu and NYK develop system for optimum biomass cofiring calculations

(Sekiyu Tsushin, July 16)
•  Idemitsu Kosan and Nippon Yusen Group, through their JV, have developed a system that
calculates and automatically controls the optimum co-firing rate of biomass fuel in coal boilers. The
system will go on sale in August.
•  Biomass fuel tends to be inferior in crushability and calorific value to coal, so the amount of
feedstock that gets used in large pulverized coal boilers is high. Idemitsu Kosan has developed a
semi-carbonized wood pellet, (“Black Pellet”), that has good crushability and calorific value, and
can be handled in almost the same way as coal in order to expand biomass co-firing at coal-fired

power plants.



ClassNK and Carbon Trust agree to support Japanese wind power
(New Energy Business News, July 14)
•  In response to the government’s green growth strategy, Maritime accreditation body ClassNK

signed a memorandum of understanding with UK-based climate change consultants, Carbon Trust,
to support the progress of offshore wind power generation in Japan.
•  The two entities hope to collaborate on assisting national initiatives to improve progress in areas
critical to the successful implementation of offshore wind projects, including acceleration of
industrial development and technical innovation, regulatory and policy reform, standardization and
increasing skills in the industry.

Japan’s power consumption to be 10% lower by 2030: METI forecast
(Nikkei, July 12)
•  By 2030, METI plans an approximate 10% reduction in the estimate for total electricity use that
forms the basis of its Basic Energy Plan.
•  The change means that the target for total electricity use in 2030 is now less than 1 Terawatt-hours.

Under the new plan, around one-third of this will be supplied by renewable sources.
•  CONTEXT: Japan currently consumes around 1.065 terawatt-hours of electricity each year.



Shizuoka government says solar farm not responsible for Atami landslide

(New Energy Business News, July 15)
•  The Shizuoka govt. released the results of its urgent investigation into the relationship between
solar farms and a recent landslide.
•  Finding no evidence that the rainwater and earth that triggered the disaster had flowed from the
site of a nearby solar farm, the survey concluded that the farm did not directly contribute to the
disaster.
•  The investigation found that on the section of the hill where the landslide began, drainage and
retention measures were inadequate.

• TAKEAWAY: As detailed in last week’s Japan NRG, the deadly landslide in Atami two weeks ago, fairly or not,
spurred criticism of solar projects from many locals and regional politicians. The govt. of the prefecture where
the landslide took place has now released the results of an initial probe that exonerates a nearby solar farm
from any blame. It will be important to see if the initial wave of criticism against solar dies down, although the
investigation by NHK, see below, indicates that the media will pursue the story for a while yet. As discussed
last week, the criticism was sparked by the land disaster but perhaps owes more to other issues in the industry.
In order to boost public sentiment towards the sector, we expect the MoE to push for more national govt

funding for municipalities that support solar projects.

NHK investigation claims 10% of solar locations carry landslide risk
(NHK, July 18)
o  Japan’s national broadcaster says it has carried out an investigation of land used by solar

facilities around the country and mapped it against areas deemed to be at risk of
landslides or other “sediment-related disaster”.
o  The report says that due to the rapid spread of solar power, there have disasters at
several facilities located on slopes. There were 11 cases recorded in western Japan three
years ago due to heavy rains, NHK says, citing METI data.
o  Analysis of the locations of solar farms of 500 watts of more shows that there are more
than 1,100 facilities nationwide that partially overlap with "earth and sand disaster risk

areas", NHK says. A total of 9,809 solar plant locations were analyzed.
o  NHK says this suggests about 10% of current solar facilities are in areas that carry risk of a
sediment-related disaster that could endanger houses.



Antitrust officials conduct further on-site checks in power cartel probe
(Denki Shimbun, July 13)
•  Japan’s Fair Trade Commission made an on-site inspection of Kansai Electric, Chugoku Electric,

Kyushu Electric, and the latter’s Kyuden Mirai Energy unit, suspecting Antimonopoly Act violations
in electricity sales.
•  The authorities are continuing the probe started in April over suggestions that the companies
engaged in anti-competitive behavior and colluded with other power firms in their catchment areas
around high-voltage electricity sales.
•  The officials suspect that the Chubu, Kansai and Kyushu areas are involved in potential antitrust
behavior.
•  CONTEXT: These are follow-up inspections to the checks conducted by the officials in April.




More than 18 GW of offshore wind projects undergoing environmental assessment in Japan
(Kankyo Business, July 15)
•  The magazine reviewed materials from several ministerial committees, which show that as of March

2021, offshore wind projects totaling a maximum capacity of 18,244 MW are currently undergoing
environmental assessment.
•  This is a strong acceleration in terms of proposed capacity, compared to 3 years ago.
•  Based on these assessments, Japan’s current offshore wind capacity, seen adding just 22 MW this
year, could jump by 299 MW in 2022. After zero additions in 2023, 1,248 MW of projects may
enter service in 2024 and 1,389 MW would come online in 2025.
•  The busiest period for new capacity, provided all the projects pass the assessment and proceed at

maximum scale, would be in 2026: 8,488 MW in new offshore wind farm capacity. That would be
followed by 4,370 MW in 2027 and 1,849 MW in 2028, before dropping to minimal levels through
to 2031.
•  The biggest capacity additions would come in Hokkaido and Kyushu areas, followed by the Aomori
/ Akita northeast areas of the main island.

• TAKEAWAY: These numbers are useful in illustrating the scale of ambition rather than as an accurate picture of
the growth in offshore wind in Japan. Most likely, some of the projects will be scrapped because they fail the
assessment, or due to cost considerations, or a lack of local approval. Note, that the numbers are very different
from the 2030 operating capacity forecasts for offshore wind that METI published earlier this month (1.7 GW to
3.7 GW).

• Putting aside the valid argument that some projects will simply take longer to develop than currently
expected, the discrepancy between industry plans and government expectations suggests that METI is not
actually interested in rushing the rollout of offshore wind. There are three reasons for this stance:

o  The national grid needs substantial upgrades to accommodate a significant new volume of
offshore wind, and most likely an underwater grid system must be created to connect to
the new projects; this takes time to plan and build

o  METI sees more value in floating wind than fixed-bottom turbines, but the former is
expected to take another decade to reach commercial levels; A go-slow approach is a way
to “save space” for floating projects

o  The govt. wants to give big power utilities time to adjust their asset portfolios to incoming
offshore wind capacity, aware that for some utilities (esp. Hokkaido, Kyushu and Tohoku)
this new generation will cause major upheaval

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Lower costs, increased competitiveness key to creating new wind markets
(Kankyo Business, July 15)
o  In just a few years, Japan’s wind generation sector has gone from a predominantly
experimental industry to a rapidly growing one.
o  Of 11 areas designated by the govt. as appropriate for wind farm development, four (two

in Akita and one each in Chiba and Nagasaki) have so far been the subject of public
tender.
o  Once installed, turbines must be maintained during their 25-year service life. This
maintenance industry is expected to revitalize local economies.
o  Port facilities will have to be upgraded to handle turbine blades and towers.
o  At a recent public-private sector conference for discussing competitiveness in the wind

farm industry, attendees advocated the rapid commercialization of floating turbine
technologies, for which there is expected to be demand in other Asian markets in future.
o  Compared to Europe, Japan is more prone to typhoons, earthquakes, and lightning.
Wind speeds also tend to be lower, so making nacelles and blades lighter is one way of
reducing costs.

Panasonic joins U.S. Schlumberger project to extract lithium from salt water
(Asia Nikkei, July 17)
•  Panasonic will take part in a project led by U.S. oil services leader Schlumberger in which lithium is
expected to be extracted from underground salt water. This process is believed to take a fraction

of the time compared with traditional mining.
•  Schlumberger has started a pilot plant to extract lithium from underground salt water in the U.S.
state of Nevada. Panasonic will test samples of the extracted lithium to check if it can be used for
EV batteries.
•  Traditionally, lithium is mined from ore bodies or extracted from brine in evaporation ponds. The
brine itself comes from underground salt lakes.
•  However, evaporating the brine to get lithium typically takes more than a year. It also involves

dealing with large quantities of impurities. Schlumberger's technology directly extracts lithium from
brine, which the company says can shorten the production schedule to just a few weeks.

Sink or Swim: How Japan Is (Re)Turning to Floating Solar
To Alleviate Space Constraints

Japan has no more readily available land for solar – that’s one argument often used by
industry skeptics. Whatever your stance, there’s an alternative space where solar
power can be installed, and in Japan it’s available in abundance.

The nation has tens of thousands of man-made reservoirs, only a fraction of which are
currently utilized. In a country that lacks vast, flat, open space, installing panels on
such bodies of water solves both energy issues and contributes to better water
management.

What’s more, Japan was the pioneer of floating solar technology. Since those initial
strides, the domestic progress for the technology has somewhat stalled. However,
with government officials desperately looking for more spaces to install solar panels to
meet national carbon neutrality pledges, reservoirs and other untapped locations are
starting to gain attention.


The first floating solar project
The world’s first floating solar was built in Japan in 2007, a 20 kW project in Aichi
prefecture, according to a report by the World Bank and the Solar Energy Research
Institute of Singapore (SERIS).

Japan was also home to the first megawatt-scale floating solar project. It was set up in
Saitama prefecture in 2013, a year after Japan introduced a feed-in tariff (FIT) program
for clean energy. The 1.18 MW station, developed by West Holdings, was built on a
reservoir. The company has since added several more floating solar installations
across the country.

Solar panels can be installed in many different places though they are commonly
mounted on the ground. However, putting panels on a floating platform, often made
with high density polyethylene (HDPE) and anchored to the bottom, brings several
advantages.

For one, floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) offers a new space for the energy source
that doesn't compete with other land-use. That’s important for countries with high
population density.

On a global scale, FPV potential runs to more than 400 GW – and that’s based on the
idea that panels are installed on 1% of the total surface area of freshwater man-made
reservoirs, according to World Bank calculations.

Japan could be among the top countries to benefit from FPV due to its existing and
extensive man-made reservoir system. There are 160,000 such bodies of water, which
were created to help manage water levels for farming. Japan remains a major rice
grower with rice paddies spread throughout the nation.

There are other advantages that FPV brings for Japan:

•    Better energy yield: the cooling effects of water beneath solar panels
helps boost energy yields by as much as 6%, according to some studies
•    Proximity to electricity demand: the reservoirs are naturally placed near
settlements
•    Cost: there’s no need for land preparation work
•    Access: land rights in Japan are complicated, while access to water is
more straightforward since it’s under state ownership and oversight

As of 2018, Japan had 145 MW of floating solar capacity installed, mainly on
reservoirs and small lakes, according to a solar industry report by the state-backed
New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

That leaves a lot of room for growth. The nation’s FPV capacity could increase to 2
GW by 2030 and 23.3 GW by 2050, according to the Japan Photovoltaic Energy
Association, a solar industry group that is promoting such development. Japan’s
natural capacity for floating solar could be as high as 38.8 GW, NEDO said in 2013.
Recent advances in PV efficiency suggest the above numbers could even be
conservative.


Faster growth elsewhere in Asia
More recently, however, growth in FPV is proceeding faster in other parts of Asia.
Worldwide, FPV is utilized in more than 35 countries with a combined capacity of
about 2.6 GW as of August 2020. Capacity is projected to grow annually above 20%
on average through 2025, but currently China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand
and Vietnam are driving demand, writes Frank Haugwitz, a senior advisor for clean
energy advisory firm Apricum.

One of the major suppliers for floating platforms in Japan is France’s Ciel & Terre,
which provided equipment for the 13.7 MW station in Chiba, the largest FPV in Japan,
and developed by Kyocera Corp. While Ciel & Terre has supplied combined solar
systems for a total of 157 MW in capacity in Japan, most of its projects range between
1 MW and 3 MW.

Meanwhile, some Asian projects have much bigger capacity, utilizing hydro dams or
even open sea areas:

• South Korea will build a 2.1 GW floating solar, the largest FPV in the world, near
the Saemangeum tidal flats on the coast of the Yellow Sea. This project will combine
0.3 GW in onshore solar with 0.1 GW of wind and 0.1 GW of fuel cell power, adding
up to be Korea’s largest renewable energy generation complex.

• India plans to build a 600 MW floating solar project at the Omkareshwar dam in
Madhya Pradesh. It is slated to start operations as early as next year.

• Hangzhou Fengling Electricity Science Technology completed a 320 MW
floating solar-aquaculture project on reservoirs in China’s Zhejiang province in early
2020.

• A venture between a subsidiary of Indonesia’s state power company PT PLN and
Masdar of United Arab Emirates is developing Indonesia’s first floating solar station
with a capacity of 145 MW in West Java. The Indonesian government may develop
60 more floating solar plants, using its more than 600 lakes and reservoirs.

• Singapore’s Blueleaf Energy is developing a 500 MW floating solar project with a
battery energy storage system of up to 200 MWh capacity in Vietnam’s Dong Nai
province. The Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility (SEACEF), a group of
international foundations including Microsoft, has invested in the project to help
Vietnam address its power shortages. The government of Gia Lai province approved
in June an investment plan for a 500 MW solar project that combines floating and
ground-mounted solar panels.


Resilience solutions
One issue that’s preventing similar large-scale developments of FPV in Japan may be
investor concern about typhoons and other extreme weather conditions. In
September 2019, one of the strongest typhoons to hit Tokyo and its surrounding area
damaged the platforms at the 13.7 MW floating solar project causing dozens of
panels to pile up and burn.

‘’An increase in strong typhoons and torrential rains is causing more wind and water
damage to solar power stations. We will continue to need safety measures,’’ NEDO
said in its solar industry report, adding that it plans to put together safety guidelines
for stations built on water.

Still, weather concern is slowly being overcome. Several wind turbines that can
withstand typhoon conditions have come on the market recently and additional
resilience solutions are being considered for solar too.

For Japan, FPV will be among the six areas expected to increase solar capacity
installations alongside wall mounts, car roofs and on agricultural land. ‘’In order to
allow for massive solar power generation in 2050, it is essential to develop
technologies’’ so that solar power can be generated at locations that to date have not
been fully utilized, NEDO said.

Biogas Emerging as a Popular Energy Source for Rural Japan

And a Niche Rival to LNG

Japan has scant oil and gas resources, but it has plenty of cow dung. And, apparently,
that could emerge as raw material for a niche, clean energy source that could displace
LNG in some rural areas.

A new biogas project in Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, aims to demonstrate
how excrement at a dairy farm could be turned into energy and heat. This process has
the potential to replace as much as half of Hokkaido’s factory LNG consumption, while
also reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by more than 60%.

The project is not an isolated case. Since the introduction of state-supported tariffs for
renewable energy, the role and number of biomass facilities has steadily grown.
Biogas in particular has recently gained government attention because, in addition to
its green credentials, it fits with the state chisan-chisho policy of promoting projects
that directly benefit immediate communities.

Below, we feature standout projects in Japan’s biogas industry, at home and overseas.

Think global, act local
In the light of the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, a major focus of
Japan’s energy policy has been to increase energy self-sufficiency by shifting to more
a decentralized energy system. While there has also been plenty of resistance at
bureaucratic and industry level to such an approach, one of the rationales behind PM
Suga’s support for renewable energy is to be the country’s main source by 2050.

In terms of utility-scale projects, the government expects most GW-sized additions to
come from the offshore wind sector and solar. Still, other renewable sources also play
an important role in future planning, and at a regional level biogas is emerging as a
favorite for its premise of delivering stable, self-sustaining CO2-free energy.

Biogas plays into the broader circular economy and recycling theme by offering an
effective way to utilize waste, thus reducing the need for disposal, and by contributing
to the resilience of local infrastructure resilience as an independent energy source.
These qualities fit well with the chisan-chisho (地産地消) state policy that promotes
locally-produced and locally-consumed products. The policy was initially devised as an
agriculture promotion, but it has been expanded to the energy sector and is being
adapted for local biomass-to-energy projects.

As more biomass projects develop in rural areas, they also help local manufacturers
more easily access the “green” electricity that their global clients demand.

Biogas production process
Biogas is generated from the anaerobic digestion and fermentation of biomass derived
from food waste, animal waste, sewage, and plant matter. In general, biogas contains
about 60% methane and about 40% CO2.

21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Since methane is more potent than CO2, instead of allowing it to be emitted a biogas
plant uses it as fuel to drive a combined heat and power (CHP) turbine and generate
electricity. The captured thermal energy can also be utilized for heating and cooling
systems, and industrial purposes.

Biogas can also be processed (upgraded) into biomethane, also known as Renewable
Natural Gas (RNG). Biomethane has a higher methane concentration of 90%, but it
qualifies as a renewable source because it’s sourced from fresh organic matter.
Biomethane can be moved by pipeline and is fully interchangeable with natural gas,
according to the U.S. Dept. of Energy.

Finally, RNG can also be converted to compressed natural
gas (CNG) or liquified natural gas (LNG) and used as vehicle
fuel. According to the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory, RNG can replace about 5% of the natural gas
used for electricity and 56% used for vehicle fuel.


Scale of biogas industry in Japan
Although the development of biogas technology has a long
history in Japan, full commercialization of biogas as a
renewable energy source is still a work in progress. Back in
2014, there were only 42 methanation fermentation facilities
that actively converted sewage into biogas for energy,
compared to a national total of about 2,150 sewage plants,
MoE data show.

Source: World Biogas Association
In the last five years, however, the industry has expanded at a growing pace. As of
March 2020, there were 228 biogas power generation facilities implemented under
the state-supported feed-in-tariff (FIT) scheme, with a total capacity of 86.1 MW.
That’s almost a quadrupling of the capacity compared with 2012 levels.

Biogas-generated power can claim an FIT of ¥39, which is more than triple that of
solar and several yen higher than offshore wind.

The number of certified biogas facilities is growing at 15 to 30 per year. The average
capacity of a biogas power generator in Japan stands at about 400 kW, with most at 2
MW or under, according to 2020 data from the Japan Organics Recycling Association.


Challenges and future trends
At the moment, the share of biogas in Japan’s energy mix is small. As well as the high
costs, the constraints for the sector includes access to adequate amounts of biomass
resources. These tend to be available mostly in rural areas and are specific to certain
industries, like dairy agriculture or food and beverage manufacturers.

This makes biogas unlikely to displace LNG and other energy sources on a national
level. However, it does offer niche opportunities in certain regions and because of the
chisan-chisho policy, a number of municipalities are pushing for more biogas projects
to be developed, seeing them as a better fit for development of the local economy
instead of other renewable energy sources, such as solar.

The treated biogas collected from the two dairy farms in Taiki Town will be processed as LBM at a factory
in Obihiro City, and used as a fuel for Yotsuba Milk Products’s factory at Otofuke town. This supply chain
model is Japan’s first attempt to produce LBM from biogas. Once realized, it’s expected to help
demonstrate the potential for LBM to replace LNG. If the project’s capacity of 360 tons of biomethane is
consumed instead of LNG, it will result in a CO2 reduction across the entire supply chain of 7,740 tons
annually, equivalent to a 60% or more cut in GHG. According to Air Water, Hokkaido has the potential to
produce 300,000 tons of biomethane annually, which is equivalent to about 50% of the annual LNG
consumption at factories in the Hokkaido prefecture.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Fit for 55; EU “Aims for the Moon” on Carbon Emissions Reductions:
On Wednesday, EU Commissioner Frans Timmerman adopted a package of 13 historic
proposals to make the EU's climate, energy, land use, transport and taxation policies
consistent with reducing net greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030 vs. 1990 levels.
The goal is to make the EU the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
The 13 proposals include:
1). A reduction of the emissions cap in the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the
elimination of free emissions for the aviation industry, and inclusion of emissions for the
shipping industry for the first time.
2). Establishing an overall EU target for carbon removals by natural sinks equivalent to
310 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2030.
3). The EU Renewable Energy Directive will set an increased target to produce 40% of
EU energy from renewable sources by 2030.
4). The public sector will renovate 3% of buildings each year to bring down energy use
and costs to taxpayers.
5). All new cars registered in the EU as of 2035 must be zero-emission.
6). The EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation requires that aircraft and ships
have access to clean electricity supply in major EU ports and airports. The ‘ReFuelEU
Aviation Initiative’ will oblige fuel suppliers to blend increasing levels of sustainable
aviation fuels in jet fuel taken on-board at EU airports, including synthetic low carbon
fuels (E-fuels).
7). A new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will put a carbon price on
imports of a targeted selection of products to avoid ‘carbon leakage'.
8). The establishment of an E72 billion package to alleviate energy poverty across the
EU.
All of the proposals will require approval by the EU Parliament and the EU Council of
27 members states and are expected to meet some resistance from EU industry. EU
aluminum producers have already requested an exclusion from the CBAM. China, Brazil,
India, and South Africa may also object to the CBAM or may apply retaliatory measures.

Nuclear Power:
1). Work has been completed to remove the internal components of reactor unit 6 of
the Bruce Nuclear Power Plant in Ontario, Canada. As part of a 48-month refurbishment
project, replacement parts will be installed in the Candu reactor in order to extend the
life of the unit by 40 years.
Bruce units 3-8 are to be refurbished, including the replacement of key reactor
components such as steam generators, pressure tubes, calandria tubes and feeder
tubes. The refurbishment is part of Bruce Power's Life-Extension Program, which started
in January 2016 and involves the gradual replacement of older systems in the
company's eight reactor units. Units 1 and 2 at the plant have already been refurbished.
Work to refurbish unit 6 began in January 2020 and is expected to be completed in
January 2024. Work is scheduled to begin on unit 3 in 2023 and unit 4 in 2025, with
each refurbishment planned to be shorter in duration, and ultimately more cost-
effective, than the previous one. The refurbishment of the final reactor, unit 8, is
scheduled to be completed in July 2033.

2). South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is still planning for the
construction of a nuclear power plant project in Dukovany, Czech Republic. Local South
Korean companies are vying with more established players from the U.S. and France to
win the contract.

Natural Gas Prices:
Gas prices in the Netherlands hit their highest levels since 2004, $13 mmbtu, as global
demand surges to meet increased need for electricity in markets such as Brazil, Canada,
and China where droughts have reduced hydropower output. The IEA will issue its first
ever Special Markets Report on hydropower tomorrow.

Oil:
OPEC released its monthly oil report. For 2021, OPEC is now predicting that world oil
demand growth is forecast at 6.0 mb/d, unchanged from the June assessment. Total oil
demand is projected to average 96.6 mb/d in 2021. World oil demand is anticipated
to rise by 3.3 mb/d y-o-y in 2022, while total world oil demand is projected to average
99.9 mb/d for 2022, with the 100 mb/d mark exceeded in 2H 2022. WTI prices closed
the week @ $72 with Brent @ $74. OPEC+ is now expected to reach a compromise
agreement with the UAE on production increases that may take effect from September
instead of August.

Aviation:
1). United Airlines (UA) and Mesa Air Group have agreed to purchase 100 small electric-
powered planes from Sweden’s Heart Aerospace and will invest $35 million in the
company. The acquisition of the aircraft is subject to successful development of the
planes. UA has also agreed to a conditional purchase of Archer Aviation’s four-seat
electric air taxi that has vertical takeoff capability.
2). Boeing will scale up production of biofuels through a partnership with SkyNRG.

Shipping:
Rosatom is building four new nuclear-powered icebreakers at St. Petersburg's Baltic
Shipyard that will be used year-round on the Northern Sea Route to Asia that will cut
15 days from the traditional Suez Canal route. The vessels will cost $400 million each,
and require a construction period of five to seven years. The ice breakers are expected
to be game changers for Russia’s oil and gas industry.

Global Electricity Demand:
A new IEA report on global electricity released last Thursday anticipates a 5% rise in
global electricity demand in 2021 vs. 2020, and another 4% in 2022, with 50% of the
increase met by fossil fuels, mainly coal, threatening to push CO2 emissions from the
power sector to record levels in 2022. China and India are driving most of the increase
in global electricity demand. Globally, coal-fired electricity generation is set to increase
by almost 5% in 2021, and by a further 3% in 2022, possibly reaching an all-time high
in 2022.

GHG Emissions:
GHG emissions by over 9,000 of the largest globally listed companies will exceed limits
set in the Paris Agreement in less than six years despite numerous net zero pledges
according to MSCI. The limits established in the Paris Agreement were established to
limit global temperature increases to 1.5 C. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore also
warned this week that green-washing could risk a successful transition away from fossil
fuels.

EVs:
1). Volkswagen now estimates that internal combustion engine (ICEs) cars manufactured
in the EU will be less profitable than EVs by 2025 when new Euro 7 engine standards
requiring expensive emissions reduction equipment for ICE vehicles become
applicable.
2). The market capitalization of CATL, China’s largest battery company, exceeded $200
billion for the first time as the stock price soared more than 60% YTD. CATL is a major
battery supplier to Tesla.

Tesla:
Elon Musk was in court last week defending Tesla’s $2.1 billion acquisition of SolarCity
in 2016. Tesla shareholders are seeking compensation for the acquisition which they
claim was a bail-out benefiting the Musk family.

Crypto Mining/Power Consumption:
China’s share of electricity usage for crypto currency mining dropped below 50% for
the first time in April, according to a recent survey. The U.S. came in second and
Kazakhstan jumped to third place for the first time, increasing its share by a factor of
six, as miners were forced to exit China. Mining of the Bitcoin currency is now thought
to generate 64 million tons of CO2 per annum, around twice what it takes to operate
the global ATM system.

China:
On Friday, China's national carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS) made its global
debut on the Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange. The ETS is part of China's
plans to reduce carbon emissions - now the world's highest - to a peak before 2030 and
to net zero by 2060. The ETS system is expected to be the largest carbon trading market
in the world; it will initially cover 2,225 power plants, responsible for over four billion
tons of CO2 emissions per annum, which is 40% of China’s total emissions, or a seventh
of total global carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion.

South Korea:
LG Chem, one of South Korea’s largest petrochemicals and battery manufacturers, will
invest $9 billion through 2025 to build sustainable production capabilities. This follows
similar commitments by SK Innovation to invest $30 billion in its green business
portfolio, and Lotte Chemical Corp. which will invest $4 billion to increase hydrogen
output.
LG also plans to invest $5.2 billion in building battery materials production including
mining, smelting, and refining investments.

Russia:
Russia agreed to forge close cooperation with the U.S. on climate change following a
visit by John Kerry to Moscow last week when he met with Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov. Russia is the fourth largest emitter of GHGs and is a signatory to the Paris
Agreement.

Ukraine:
Ukrainian authorities continue to argue that the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline
linking Russia with Germany threatens Ukrainian security. President Zelensky took up
the matter with Chancellor Merkel last week and President Biden also discussed the
issue with the German chancellor during meetings in Washington on Friday.

Saudi Arabia:
Saudi Aramco chose two U.S. investment banks to advise on a planned sale of a stake
in its domestic natural gas pipeline network worth several billion dollars. Aramco’s gas
pipeline network connects its production with processing sites throughout the country
and has a capacity of 9.6 billion cf/day.

UAE:
The emirate opened an embassy in Israel for the first time.

Spain:
Siemens Gamesa, the wind turbine maker, warned of sharply increasing raw materials
prices as metals prices continue to soar. The stock price dropped by 10% on
Wednesday.

UK:
1). Last week the government launched a groundbreaking transport decarbonization
plan to create cleaner, quieter cities and communities for better quality of life and to
improve the way people and goods move around. The plan includes ending the sale of
all new, polluting road vehicles by 2040 and net zero aviation emissions by 2050. It also
includes smart electric vehicle charging that could reduce energy bills, and a
commitment to electrify the entire fleet of government cars and vans by 2027.
2). Good Energy, an RE energy provider, rejected a takeover bid by Ecotricity, a wind
energy company.

United States:
1). Altus Power, a builder and operator of solar-power projects on roofs and parking
lots, will list through a CBRE-sponsored SPAC that will value the company at $1.6 billion.
2). The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urged owners of GM’s
Chevrolet Bolt vehicles to park vehicles away from homes due to the risk of fire in the
vehicles’ cell packs.
3). U.S. federal prosecutors at the SEC are investigating Lordstown Motors, the EV
company, in connection with falsification of data prior to its SPAC listing with
DiamondPeak Holdings in 2020. The stock price has collapsed by almost 70% over the
last six months.
4). Aurora, the self-driving technology company focused on passenger and trucking, is
planning to list via a SPAC that will give it an initial valuation of close to $11 billion.

Colombia:
Canadian Solar won a utility-scale battery storage project awarded by the Colombian
government. The 45MWh lithium-ion energy system is expected to operate
commercially by mid-2023.

Brazil:
Raizen, a Brazilian JV between Shell and Cosan that produces biofuels and ethanol, is
expected to list on Sao Paulo’s B3 bourse and raise $1.3 billion, making it one of the 10
largest IPOs on record in Brazil. Proceeds will be used to expand renewable biofuels
projects.
