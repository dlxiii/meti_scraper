NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







GX Promotion Bill passed, state bonds will amount to ¥20 trillion over 10 years
(Nikkei, March 30)
•  The GX Promotion bill was passed by the House of Representatives. The govt aims to issue new
state bonds that will amount to ¥20 trillion over 10 years, and to invest over ¥150 trillion in the
public and private sectors.
•  Another aspect is the full-scale introduction of carbon pricing, which requires companies to pay a

levy on CO2 emissions.
•  From FY2028, there’ll be a carbon levy on fossil fuel importers. From FY2033, power generation
firms will have to pay such a surcharge. The funds will be used for amortization of transition bonds.


Chief Cabinet Sec: “great interest” in EU’s decision on e-fuel cars

(Government statement, March 27)
•  Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno said the government has much interest in the recent EU decision
to allow e-fuel cars in addition to EVs after 2035; the region accounts for 10% of the Japanese
automakers market.
•  EV, FCV and e-fuel vehicles comprise the carmakers’ portfolios and the govt will continue to
engage in technology developments toward their commercialization, he said.
•  CONTEXT: In February, IHI and Minami Soma City began test runs of bus services fueled by e-
methane. E-fuel production cost is ¥300-¥700/ liter; ENEOS expects commercialization in the

2040’s. Bioethanol is seen as a transition fuel until costs fall. The bioethanol blending ratio in
gasoline is up to 85-100% in France and Brazil; but Japan lags behind at 3%.
• TAKEAWAY: Matsuno’s remarks are encouraging for lobby groups pushing to increase bioethanol and e-fuel
consumption. There will be various pressures to overturn ANRE’s February decision to limit the annual country-
wide bioethanol import at 0.5 million crude equivalent kiloliters (3.1 million barrels) until 2027, to spur local
fuel production. The U.S. govt has also been seeking to export more bioethanol to Japan.

• (For more details, check our Archive for the “Green mobility: Is EV the only way?” webinar from Jan 18; and
the Analysis piece “Toyota Has Not Given Up on Gasoline: Automaker Plans to Develop “Green Gasoline” in
the Sept 5, 2022 NRG Weekly issue.)



JCM: Govt publishes guidance for private sector to expand investments
(Japan NRG, March 28)
•  Japan published guidance for Joint Crediting Mechanism projects to be implemented by private
companies without state financing; the goal is to expand project scope to private investments.

•  The guidance will be effective possibly in 2024, after reaching agreements with 25 countries
participating in JCM.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Two procedures were added: 1) submission of Project Idea Note to both the Japanese govt and
the govt of the country where a project takes place, and 2) confirmation that there is no objection
to the project.
•  CONTEXT: JCM projects using governmental aid are subject to spending, scheduling and other
rules, while private sector financing will enjoy more flexibility. Further JCM expansion will include

projects involving more than two countries and application of new technologies such as CCS and
carbon recycling.
• TAKEAWAY: This JCM expansion is driven by demand from businesses in Asia looking for Japanese partners,
as well as Japan’s need to meet its goal for 100 million ton CO2 of JCM credits by 2030. (For more
information, see “MOE’s Point Man for the JCM Program Outlines Expansion Plans” in the Jan 10, 2023 issue.)




JERA eyes commercializing perovskite solar power supply after 2025
(Company statement, March 27)
•  JERA eyes commercialization of solar power supplies generated from perovskite solar cells (PSC)
possibly after 2025, following pilot projects with Sekisui Chemical.

•  It plans to supply PSC-generated power at the Yokosuka coal power station.
•  CONTEXT: PSC is a new technology using perovskite crystal structure to absorb a broader
spectrum of light compared to silicon solar cells. PSC modules are lighter and thinner.
• TAKEAWAY: JERA would be the first power utility in Japan to commercialize PSC-based services, and possibly
the world’s first. If successful, it will have a major impact in the photovoltaic industry as PSC’s applications are
generally seen as limited to building-integrated systems, farms and EVs due to PSC’s low power efficiency

below 20%.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JERA starts PSC cells demo, partners with Sekisui Chemical

(Denki Shimbun, March 28)
o  In a first, JERA began a demo experiment to deploy film-type perovskite solar cells (PSC)
at thermal power stations.
o  One-meter square of PSCs will be installed on the wall surface or rooftop of Yokosuka
Power Station (Kanagawa Pref) and Kashima Power Station (Ibaraki Pref), which will be
stationed at four angles: flat, 30-degree, 60-degree and 90-degree.
o  JERA chose Sekisui Chemical because its PSC power generation efficiency is 15%, the

highest among all companies.



METI to expand scope of resource reduction, reuse and recycling act
(Japan NRG, March 27)
•  METI plans to expand the scope of the Resource Reduction, Reuse and Recycling Act, also known
as the “3-R Act”, and will be rewriting product guidelines to make material re-use more systematic
in industries.

•  The ministry plans to clarify liability on the recycled materials that may affect the quality and safety
of final products; the goal is to encourage labeling recycled material use, etc.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Separately, METI plans to subsidize development of solid waste processing technologies to collect
CO2 and produce synthetic methane.
•  CONTEXT: Industries covered by the 3-R Act are steel, non-ferrous metals, automotive, chemicals
and paper, and products including cars, home appliances, PCs and digital gadgets, metal furniture,
batteries, paper, and glass containers.

• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s recycle rates of car components are almost 100% and over 80% for most metals, but are
at about 10% for plastic containers and trays. Sorting plastic wastes ranging from biodegradable plastics made
from plants to oil-derived containers is labor intensive.



Japan, U.S. sign bilateral EV minerals pact
(Government statement, March 29)
•  Japan and the U.S. signed a EV minerals pact covering lithium, manganese, nickel, cobalt and
graphite to strengthen supply chains and promote EV battery technologies.
•  The govts will not impose bilateral trade restrictions on these minerals, and maintain current
practice of not imposing export duties while promoting market competition.

•  They’ll share reviews of investments in mineral supply chains in their jurisdictions.
•  The pact will be reviewed every two years.
• TAKEAWAY: The pact specifically states EV minerals rather than broader “transition minerals” that would cover
rare earths. The impact on the Japanese supply chain is marginal as the country hardly buys those five EV
minerals from the U.S. Technically, a possibility of the U.S. imposing trade restrictions on rare earths remains.
Meanwhile, the pact could be a basis for the multilateral critical mineral security framework discussed among

G7 nations.


Maldives to run world’s first zero-emission NAS battery storage system

(Japan NRG, March 30)
•  A 1.45 MWh sodium sulfide (NAS) storage battery system to be installed in the Gulhifalhu
desalination plant in Maldives in 2024 will possibly be the world’s first NAS system that runs
entirely on renewable power, system suppliers told Japan NRG.
•  Storage batteries, including lithium-ion batteries, often require separate power sources to maintain
proper temperatures when in standby mode.
•  Hitachi Zosen will design the power systems; NGK Insulators will supply the batteries.




Cosmo Oil questions current Japan capability for direct biomass imports
(Japan NRG, March 30)
•  Cosmo Oil told Japan NRG that direct biomass imports from Thailand’s Bangchak and others
might be necessary because Japan Biofuel Supply (JBSL) might not be able to meet increases in
demand.
•  JBSL is a JV of Cosmo, ENEOS, Idemitsu, Taiyo Oil and Fuji Oil to import biomass, particularly

bioethanol and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) for gasoline blending. JBSL will import bioethanol for
SAF feedstock, but no final decision has been made on importing from Bangchak. Cosmo and
Bangchak are discussing options.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Some market participants have raised concerns that if JBSL holds very large market shares, then it
may be seen as restraining competition. ENEOS confirmed to Japan NRG that it imports ETBE
solely from JBSL. Cosmo and ENEOS maintained that JBSL is fully complying with the Anti-
Monopoly Act.
• TAKEAWAY: Former Japan Fair Trade Commission officials told Japan NRG that since gasoline blending

material has a marginal impact on gasoline prices, and since there’s a lack of verifiable bioethanol market data,
any possible anti-monopoly violation is difficult to establish. However, JBSL’s actions will be of interest for
businesses planning entry into the biomass import market.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Cosmo Oil, Thailand’s Bangchak to explore biomass, CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen
(Company statement, March 24)
o  Cosmo Oil and Thailand’s Bangchak Corp will explore projects in SAF, bioethanol and
bionaphtha, CCUS, low-carbon hydrogen transport and application, and lubricants.
o  Bangchak plans to commercialize SAF production in late 2024.




ENEOS and Australia’s Ampol to explore biofuels production
(Company statement, March 23)
•  ENEOS signed an MoU with Australia’s Ampol to explore biofuel production at Lytton refinery in
Brisbane, Queensland. The companies will study production of up to 500 million liters per year of
renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
•  The project will utilize waste derived from local flora and fauna, and will utilize the region’s

refineries and sales networks.
•  The companies plan to supply biofuels to Japan, Australia and the rest of Asia and Pacific.
Queensland might support the project.



Tokyo Gas and Mitsubishi HC Capital to use a transition loan, Japan’s first

(Company statement, March 24)
•  Tokyo Gas agreed with Mitsubishi HC Capital to use transition loan financing.
•  Tokyo Gas will sell a gas engine power generation facility (90 MW) at its Shiinomori Power Station
(Sodegaura City, Chiba Pref) to Mitsubishi HC Capital on a ‘lease-back’ basis. The funds will be
invested in solar power generation.
•  Mitsubishi HC Capital will raise funds from Mitsubishi UFJ Bank via a transition loan.
•  CONTEXT: The funding is from "Transition financing by Enabler" (an institution that funds the
transitions of others). This plan debuted with METI's "FY2022 global warming countermeasures

promotion project cost subsidy". This agreement is the first of its kind in Japan.

Nagoya academic sees way to cut DAC costs by 30%
(Nikkei, March 28)
•  Nagoya University’s Professor Norinaga Koyo is researching a unique Direct Air Capture (DAC)
method that uses cold heat to capture CO2 when LNG vaporizes. The new method is expected to

be up to 30% cheaper than conventional methods.
•  Norinaga cooperates with Toho Gas and JGC, and aims to start testing the approach by FY2024 to
capture one ton of CO2.
•  Norinaga believes that up to 60 million tons of CO2 can be recovered annually from Japanese
LNG imports. He also believes that cold heat from liquified hydrogen could be used in a similar
way.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Kyushu Electric and Sojitz partner to develop commercial DAC system
(Company statement, March 22)
o  Kyushu Electric, Sojitz, and Kyushu University will develop a direct air capture and
utilization (DAC-U) system; it will also use a separation membrane-based direct air
capture (m-DAC) unit developed by Kyushu Univ that extracts CO2 directly from the
atmosphere, with another device that converts the CO2 into fuel.

o  Since February 2022, Kyushu University and Sojitz have tried to commercialize m-DAC.
Kyushu Electric does verification and development of technical applications.
o  The m-DAC research is part of the Moonshot Research and Development Program.



Chubu consortium sets long-term hydrogen and ammonia market goals

(Company statement, March 27)
•  Aichi Pref, JERA, Toyota Motor and 18 other companies in the Chubu region plan to collectively
generate demand for 0.23 million tons of hydrogen and 1.5 million tons of ammonia by 2030,
increasing that to 2 million and 6 million tons, respectively, by 2050.
•  The group will explore applications in mobility, manufacturing, and promote the building of
hydrogen service stations and other infrastructure; as well as establish a plan to verify the
molecule’s low-carbon footprint.




NYK Line to supply power from tidal energy to an off-grid island in Singapore
(Company statement, March 29)
•  NYK began supplying electricity generated from tidal energy to Raffles Lighthouse on Satumu
Island near Singapore with a demo project by Bluenergy Solutions.
•  The project aims to commercialize the generation and supply of electricity from tidal energy, which
uses tidal currents.
•  The turbines are provided by Bluenergy Solutions in Singapore. Having “bi-directional

configuration,” the turbines can effectively generate energy in both high and low tides. The
turbine is small in size and generates a max of 1 GWh of electricity per year.

Mitsui OSK Lines joins ocean energy conversion project in Okinawa
(Company statement, March 24)
•  Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL), Xenesys, and Saga University joined an ocean thermal energy conversion
(OTEC) demo project using deep-ocean water on Kume Island, Okinawa, as a part of the MoE’s

“Technology Development and Demonstration Project for Regional Symbiosis and Cross-Sectoral
Carbon Neutrality”.
•  The demo facility is owned by Okinawa Pref, and maintained and managed by Xenesys to gain
OTEC operation know-how. The project aims to achieve the world’s first OTEC on a 1 MW scale by
2026.
•  The project includes manufacturing large, parallel-type titanium heat exchangers equivalent to 200

kW of power generation, aiming to establish large-scale heat recovery technology from seawater
by 2024.
•  CONTEXT: Research has been conducted in Japan, Hawaii, South Korea, and the Republic of
Nauru; but commercialization of OTEC still hasn’t been achieved. With this project, MOL aims to
commercialize OTEC power generation in Japan and overseas, utilizing the company’s know-how
and supply-chain networks. Adapting OTEC to the marine industry is called the Kumejima Model
and it has been experimented on for over 10 years.




J-POWER uses wind-powered kite propulsion for a coal carrier
(Company statement, March 23)
•  On the coal carrier Corona Citrus, J-Power and “K” LINE will install an automated kite system,
Seawing. The wind power will reduce fuel oil use, and CO2 emissions by 20% compared with
conventional propulsion. The vessel is the first coal carrier to use this system for a Japanese

thermal power station.
•  The vessel also uses a Sox scrubber to remove sulfur oxides from exhaust gas.













Shizuoka Pref plans a carbon neutral port with 16,000 ton of H2 demand

(New Energy Business News, March 24)
•  The Shimizu carbon neutral port (CNP) project aims to affordably produce, procure, and store
hydrogen and fuel ammonia. Production of hydrogen and fuel ammonia is estimated to be 16,000
tons in 2030 and 41,000 tons in 2050.
•  All vessels and vehicles going to and from the port of Shimizu are also included in the project
when calculating decarbonization.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Shizuoka aims to reduce CO2 by 114,000 tons in 2030, which is 44% less than in 2021. By 2050,
Shimizu port will be decarbonized 100%.


Japanese banks to provide $300 million for renewable power in Vietnam

(Nikkei Asia, March 28)
•  JBIC, Mizuho, Joyo, and Shiga Bank will offer $300 million in credit to power producers using
renewable energy in Vietnam. The funds will be provided via Vietcombank.
•  The bank will provide subleasing loans to local businesses. By utilizing Vietcombank’s credit
information, Japanese banks expect the high-risk loans can be provided swiftly.
•  Vietnam has a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The country seeks to replace coal-fired
power generation, which currently accounts for 50% of total power generation, with alternative

power sources; as well as to cope with growing electricity demand.


Saudi Aramco to work with Japanese startup to develop all-polymer battery tech
(Denki Shimbun, March 28)
•  APB Corp, a lithium-ion battery startup in Fukui Pref will collaborate with Saudi Aramco to develop
All-Polymer Battery materials.
•  APB was founded in 2018 by a former Nissan battery system engineer; it uses technology to

replace metals with much safer polymers. Large scale production begins in 2026.
•  Saudi Aramco seeks to transform its oil business to low-carbon technologies.



Itochu and Resonac to study recycling of plastic with an eye on ammonia production

(Company statement, March 29)
•  Itochu and Resonac signed an MoU to study recycling plastics and fibers.
•  Itochu will supply Resonac with RPAF, a recycled solid raw material mixed with used plastics and
fibers, which will be transformed into low-carbon ammonia and other chemical products as part of
a recycling project by the two companies.
•  CONTEXT: In 2003, Resonac began to gasify used plastics and recycle them into hydrogen. Low-
carbon ammonia, which is produced using hydrogen extracted as a raw material, is made from

used plastics and does not use fossil fuel-derived energy in the manufacturing process.



TEPCO: damage at Fukushima NPP Unit 1 containment structure
(Kyodo, March 30)
•  During inspection using an underwater robot, TEPCO said extensive damage was found at the
base of the nuclear reactor containment structure for Fukushima NPP Unit 1.
•  The concrete had eroded; only an iron frame remains.

•  The containment structure weighs 440 tons; possibility of a collapse is real. TEPCO claims that the
structure won’t collapse because it’s also supported from the sides. TEPCO will also report on
earthquake safety measures.

JFTC slaps ¥101 billion penalties on EPCOs; Chugoku Electric execs resign
(Government and company statements, March 30)
•  The Japan Fair Trade Commission issued a cease and desist order, and levied penalties totaling
¥101 billion against three EPCOs and their two subsidiaries, on cartel charges.
•  Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric, Kyushu Electric, Chubu Electric Power Miraiz, and Kyuden Mirai

Energy agreed in 2018 to restrain competition in business users markets, i.e., the high-voltage
market.
•  The parties must pay the penalties by Oct 31, and call a board meeting and confirm that illicit
agreements have ceased.
•  Chugoku Electric president Takimoto Natsuhiko and chairman Shimizu Mareshige resigned
following their board meeting.
•  Chubu Electric and Chubu Electric Miraiz will challenge the JFTC decision.
•  Chugoku Electric finds some JFTC decisions to be unacceptable and might appeal.

•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) has asked companies for follow-up
reports.
•  CONTEXT: The cartel was exposed during discussions on revising power market competition rules
amid transition to non-fossil power. One idea was to put the former regional monopolies, or
EPCOs, and the new market entrants in separate markets, but that was shelved. Due to the recent
incident of EPCOs illicitly accessing customer data of other power companies, the idea to fully

separate the power generation, transmission and retail units of EPCOs – in order to guarantee a
level playing field for non-EPCOs – is gaining momentum. Ironically, it was the JFTC that first
proposed the full separation of EPCOs business units in 2012.
• TAKEAWAY: The JFTC hearing for the power companies, a procedure before regulatory decisions, took four
months, which is unusually long. One former JFTC official said this was due to the EPCOs filing massive
amounts of evidence to dispute the allegations.

• Eyes are on the power market regulator, the EGC, whether it will take a hard line to restore confidence, and
how the EGC will align with the JFTC. For example, to ensure nondiscriminatory offering of wholesale power,
the EPCOs file “commitment pledges” to the EGC. Some observers doubt this guarantees a level playing
field. (See also “Japan’s Electricity Watchdog Gets Expanded Remit, Still Lacks Real Clout to Maintain Market

Competition” in the Dec 21, 2020 issue.)
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE mulls amendments to prevent EPCOs’ unauthorized data access

(Japan NRG, March 29)
o  ANRE told the basic power and gas policy panel that it’s studying law and ordinance
amendments, new sector-wide rules, and stronger compliance guidelines to prevent
major power utilities (EPCOs) from illicitly accessing the customer data of other
operators.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Another ANRE panel on renewables and next-gen networks is also reviewing the case, as
well as the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGS). ANRE stressed the
need for speedy and strong actions following these reviews.
o  On March 31, the EGS submitted its findings and proposed action to the METI minister,
who makes the final decision. By 2026, EGS said the companies will separate customer

data systems shared by the EPCOs and their power transmission arms, as well as conduct
compliance staff training and disclose progress of corrective actions.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JFTC asks power utilities body to strengthen antitrust compliance
(Government and FEPC statements, March 30)
o  The JFTC asked the Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPC) for stricter

compliance, not just among EPCO members, but also among the secretariat.
o  The FEPC will investigate the EPCOs facing cartel charges, their affiliates and the FEPC
secretariat on information sharing and other issues relevant to antitrust compliance.
o  The FEPC is also required to set measures for fair and transparent competition.
• TAKEAWAY: This is an unusual move by the JFTC, suggesting that the regulator is looking beyond antitrust
compliance and into improving the market competition mechanism. JFTC also has oversight on mergers and
acquisitions, and will continue to have a role in the power sector. This also means the JFTC’s capacity to

design future rules, in addition to enforcing existing regulations, is being tested.


Petrofac, Hitachi Energy in $14 billion deal with TenneT

(Reuters, March 30)
●  Petrofac and Hitachi won a $14 billion deal from Dutch-German electricity grid operator TenneT
to supply offshore platforms and onshore converter stations.
●  The deal is part of TenneT’s 2 GW high-voltage direct current offshore wind program in the North
Sea, and it includes six projects equally split between Petrofac and Hitachi.
●  Petrofac will do engineering, procurement, construction and installation of offshore platforms and
parts of the onshore converter stations, to be supplied by Hitachi.




Summer power reserve rates seen to hold above critical 3%, except Tokyo
(Japan NRG, March 29)
•  ANRE forecasts power reserve rates to hold above the critical 3% threshold this summer, except
for Tokyo. Rates above 4.6% are forecasted for winter.
•  There is a 40% chance of summer temperatures rising above averages. While June is not a high

demand month, ANRE requests to closely track demand and supply trends.
•  Supplies have increased with new thermal capacities and higher run rates of nuclear plants. JERA
will launch commercial operation of the 647 MW New Anegasaki Unit 3 (LNG) in August and the
650 MW Yokosuka Unit 2 (coal) in Feb 2024.
•  CONTEXT: Reserve rates are the forecast of demand over supply in a worst-case scenario. 3% is

Japan Atomic’s future hangs in balance after regulator threatens to end Tsuruga NPP review

(Government statement, Denki Shimbun, March 30)
•  NRA Chairman Yamanaka said there’s a possibility of ending the restart review of Japan Atomic
Power Company (JAPC)’s Tsuruga NPP Unit 2. The regulator will make a final decision in April on
how to proceed after accusing the utility of complying far less than required with its review
process.
•  CONTEXT: In 2020, JAPC was accused of revising geological data for Tsuruga, which stopped the
review until late 2022. The process restarted, but last month JAPC reported that there were seven

more data errors in its submissions.
• TAKEAWAY: This matter has grave implications for JAPC that extend far beyond one reactor at its Tsuruga
NPP. It could undermine the entire company, which is the only power utility in Japan to focus almost
exclusively on nuclear energy.

• The regulator is accusing the company of manipulating or interfering with data, which is a safety and
compliance issue. While the NRA makes the final technical decision on the restart of reactors in Japan, the
facilities cannot operate without local consent that comes through a green light from the local authorities. In
2018, the NRA gave its approval for the restart of JAPC’s Tokai NPP Unit 2. The reactor, however, has not
come back online due to a lack of local support. That support is now even less likely given the nature of the
current accusations. What’s more, J-Atomic also planned to build two more units at the Tsuruga NPP. Those

plans too will be in jeopardy if the company is seen as unfit to handle nuclear operations. In this sense, the
Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 decision affects the future of four reactors and possibly the fate of the company as a
whole.

ANRE: 28% of "inefficient" coal capacity to shift to biomass co-firing

(Japan NRG, March 29)
•  ANRE says that 28% of coal power stations utilizing older technologies will upgrade to biomass co-
firing by 2030. Total inefficient coal capacity stood at 1.68 GW in 2021.
•  46% of capacity face replacement or scrappage plans; 19% have already implemented co-firing
and other GHG reduction measures.
•  According to Nippon Environmental Energy Development (NEED), costs to upgrade a 95 MW
plant are estimated to be ¥44 billion and ¥4.3 billion/ year additional running costs.




METI considers moving oil-fired power plants into the reserve system
(Denki Shimbun, March 30)
•  As the cost of oil is now lower than natural gas and coal, METI is discussing whether to grant
preferential treatment to oil-fired power plants as a reserve source.
•  At the meeting of the Power and Gas Strategic Policy Committee, METI said it will share the cost
of oil-fired power plants under a standby system.

• TAKEAWAY: This will mean these facilities can start up in times of urgent need, such as a major disaster, and
do not have to trade on the capacity market.




TEPCO will lower price hike in compliance with government’s request
(Denki Shimbun, March 31)
•  TEPCO HD and TEPCO Energy Partner, the electricity retailer company operating under TEPCO,
pledged to lower the price hike that they requested on Jan 23.
•  The period used to calculate the cost of crude oil, LNG and coal was changed to a more recent
period (from Nov 2022 to Jan 2023); so, the price hike requested was cut from ¥9.16/ kWh to

¥5.51/ kWh. Thus, the average price hike was cut from 29.3% to 17.6%.

INPEX says Australia could undermine global security if it quits LNG
(ABC, Bloomberg, March 30)
•  INPEX CEO Ueda Takayuki expressed concern about Australia’s decision to quit the international
gas trade, as it could have a negative impact on global security.
•  Ueda said such policies could lead Japan to rely more on coal instead of LNG for energy. He also
said Russia, Iran and China would inevitably replace Australia.

•  Ambassador Yamagami Shingo stressed the importance of cooperation with Australia, as Japan
heavily depends on its resources.
•  CONTEXT: Late last year, the Australian govt capped coal and gas prices for 12 months, and asked
producers to abide by "reasonable pricing". This followed last year’s record coal and gas prices
and increased household electric bills. The govt’s decision heavily affected several local LNG
projects, including INPEX’s Ichthys.
•  Last week, the Australian Energy Market Operator said that Australia may need to curb contracted

LNG exports from 2026 unless it raises domestic gas output. Current consumption trends and the
potential for natural gas to be used in the manufacture of hydrogen mean that local supply is very
tight.



METI forecasts gasoline demand to slump 11% in 2027 from 2022

(Government statement, March 31)
•  Gasoline demand is set to decrease by 10.8% in 2027 compared to the 2022 level of 44.7 million
kiloliters (281 million barrels), METI said in its long-term demand forecast.
•  Kerosene is set to fall 12.8% from 12.8 million kl; and A fuel oil, also known as marine fuel oil, to
fall by 16.9% from 10.4 million kl.

JFE Engineering to build ¥30 billion LNG terminal in Taiwan
(Company statement, March 28)
•  JFE Engineering secured a contract from Taiwan’s major oil and gas company, CPC, for the
construction of a new LNG terminal in Taiwan. Contract is about ¥30 billion.

•  The facility will include LNG recovering equipment from transport vessels, pipelines, and
equipment for transporting seawater to heat LNG and return it to gas. Construction will start by
May 2025.
•  JFE Engineering will build pipe platforms at a port near the construction site in order to avoid
problems related to strong winds. This will be the method’s first application in Taiwan for LNG
terminal construction.
•  CONTEXT JFE Engineering has been building LNG terminals in Japan for 50 years. As Taiwan

expands its power plants, JFE Engineering expects more orders in the future.



Idemitsu raises stake in Australian vanadium miner Vecco to 14.7%
(Company statement, March 24)
•  Idemitsu increased its stake in Australian vanadium miner Vecco Group to 14.7%, investing an
additional A$8.26 million.

•  Vecco plans to produce vanadium pentoxide and electrolyte for redox-flow batteries using metal
feedstock from its own mine.
•  CONTEXT: Redox-flow batteries are one of the alternatives to lithium-ion storage batteries.
• TAKEAWAY: A key vanadium trader told Japan NRG that Idemitsu’s decisions to invest in several Australian
vanadium mining companies last year surprised the metal trading community, because the company has
almost no track record in the redox-flow battery nor vanadium businesses. Redox-flow batteries face slow

growth, even in China, which had plans to scale up production, the trader added.


JX Nippon Mining & Metals sells interests in copper mine in ¥120 billion deal

(Company statement, March 28)
•  JX Nippon Mining & Metals will sell to Toronto-based Lundin Mining Corp 51% of its shares in
wholly-owned subsidiary, SCM Minera Lumina Copper Chile that operates the Caserones Copper
Mine. The deal is worth ¥120 billion. JX Nippon Mining faces a loss of ¥70 billion for FY2023.
•  There are plans to sell an additional 19% stake to Lundin or a third party, which would bring the
final stake down to 30%.
•  CONTEXT: In 2006, when JX Nippon Mining acquired the middle-sized mine with ¥5.4 billion in

funds from JOGMEC, it was publicized as the “hinomaru mine”, the first mine with a national flag.
Previously, Japanese companies held minority stakes in international mines but did not have whole
ownership. The mine is unique as it produces copper cathode on-site, along with copper and
molybdenum ore concentrate. Total investment will be more than ¥600 billion. Caserones was also
a high cost mine due to its ore quality, volume and location.
• TAKEAWAY: It took a long time for the Caserones sale to materialize. Alongside energy self-sufficiency, the
govt was pushing to raise self-sufficiency of copper concentrate, making it difficult for any company to justify a

copper mine stake sale.

ANALYSIS

ED O’TOOLE

Japan to Create Energy Security Through New Strategic LNG Reserve
Japan has announced plans to create a strategic LNG reserve to ensure the world’s
largest importer has enough natural gas to meet domestic demand in an increasingly
competitive market. The reserve could account for about 1% of Japan’s total LNG
imports. However, it also suggests a growing conflict between Japanese energy security
and climate policies.

Traditionally, Japan has purchased the vast bulk of its LNG via long-term contracts, lasting
several decades in some cases. Uncertainty about future domestic demand, partly driven
by the national goal to shift the power mix away from fossil fuels, has created a strong
reaction from Japanese LNG buyers. The volume that Japan has contracted under long-
term deals is forecast to decline by over a third during this decade alone.
The shrinking of Japan’s long-term LNG portfolio comes at a time when other major
markets are signing up to a host of such lengthy deals. China, which is set to displace its
neighbor as the world’s top buyer, is projected to see its contracted volumes jump
significantly over the next few years.

Should Japan’s proposed shift to a greater reliance on renewable energy proceed as
planned, thus also meeting national emission reduction targets, the scale back on longer-
term LNG deals will be justified. But a disruption to those plans, or to the LNG supply
from existing contracts, could push Japan into the unfamiliar territory of depending on
the more capricious spot market to balance the scales. The new strategic reserve
attempts to straddle the divide. How much impact will it have?

Background
METI has announced its intention to create a strategic LNG reserve in Japan to expand
the nation’s options for coping with acute LNG shortage situations.

The ministry proposes that Japanese LNG importers continue to secure supply via longer
term contracts. If the contracted volumes are not required domestically, the buyers would
be free to sell their "buffer" cargoes into the international market. However, in times of a
fuel shortage, the government would ask the importers to redirect their LNG to the
utilities and other consumers most in need. Any losses incurred by the LNG sellers would
be reimbursed through a fund within state-owned JOGMEC Corp., which is now also
known as the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security.
The reserve’s mechanism is still being worked through, but the initial proposal states that
Japan buy one cargo per month, between December and February. At an average LNG
cargo of 70,000 to 80,000 tons, that could net the reserve close to 1 million tons per
annum (mtpa). In 2022, Japan imported 72 million tons.

If METI’s plan moves forward and companies are selected, the system could begin in
December 2023. Supporting a strategic LNG reserve could become more important for
the country as up to 19.2 million tons of Japan's contracts expire between 2021 to 2026,
according to the latest release by the G2M2 database.
In the short term, this strategic buffer is expected to provide additional security of LNG
supply for the peak demand in winter. Natural gas makes up about a third of the nation’s
power mix.

Looking further out, however, the 2030 energy strategy calls for fossil fuels to lose half of
their share of the electricity mix. As a result, METI estimates that the nation’s demand for
natural gas will decline by a third at the end of the decade compared to 2021 levels.
Recent contract activity suggests that Japan's LNG buyers expect METI policies to have
an immediate and steady impact on demand, as they allow for a commensurate decrease
in their contracted LNG supply.

Carbon neutrality impact
Japan has enshrined its net-zero 2050 pledge into law. Although the country’s emissions
have declined for a seventh consecutive year in 2020, Japan still ranks as the world’s No.5
emitter. Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for most of its greenhouse gas emissions, which
stood at 1.15 billion tons, according to government data.

Natural gas is predominantly used for power generation and heat, as city gas. It is also a
key part of many industrial processes. Together with oil and coal, fossil fuels account for
well over 80% of Japan’s primary energy.
According to the International Energy Agency, that high dependence will ease before
2030. The IEA’s World Energy Outlook (2022) paints several scenarios, all of which see
significant declines in Japan’s use of petroleum and coal, which will be replaced by
nuclear and renewables. The IEA forecasts natural gas demand to drop by as much as
45% by 2030. METI’s estimate is more cautious at 34%, but still a notable decline.

It should be added, however, that gas is also used in many cogeneration systems in
Japan, which simultaneously produce electricity and heat in the industrial, commercial,
and residential sectors. This boosts efficiency and cuts emissions, and shows the strong
role natural gas plays in energy security. In the past decade, sudden shortages of gas
have led to spikes in electricity prices since Japan has a low self-sufficiency rate for
primary energy.
As an island nation, Japan has no power grid connections to other countries and no
international gas pipeline links.


Is Japan shedding long-term deals too quickly?
While the analyses indicate that Japan’s gas demand will decline, the behavior of the
country’s buyers demonstrates that they agree.

The current portfolio of LNG contracts for all of Japan's LNG importers (“buyers” in
Figure 5 below) is declining at a more aggressive rate than METI’s goal for a 34%
reduction in gas demand by 2030.

The decline in contracted LNG going to Japan comes as Europe’s long-term contracts
have jumped from nothing in 2021 to over 25 mtpa in 2022. China’s contracted
liquefaction capacity grew from 3.4 mtpa to 20.5 mtpa in 2021 and remained steady
at 19.8 mpta in 2022.
















Figure 5: Contract signing by year and destination. Source: RBAC G2M2®, GIIGNL

While European buyers are signing new contracts seemingly to offset declines from
contracts in force that are expiring through 2030, China's buyers are much more
bullish. There has been a 60.4% increase in recently signed contracted capacity
between 2021 and 2028, which reflects the Chinese government’s greater emphasis
on natural gas in its current five-year plan.


















Figure 6: Contracted LNG capacity by year, destination and signing date. Source: RBAC G2M2®, GIIGNL
Japan’s reluctance to renew or sign new long-term deals in recent years comes just as
the global LNG market enters a very tight supply-demand phase. Almost all new
capacity available in 2023 is taken. After that, the majority of production capacity
that’s available for contracting will come from proposed or under-construction export
facilities. As shown in Figure 7: Global LNG liquefaction capacity and contracted capacity.
Source: , current levels of contracted capacity remain relatively steady through 2027.

Conclusion
For Japan's LNG buyers, the confluence of the trends above could pose a problem if
demand reduction goals set by METI are not met and new LNG export facilities do not
come online as planned. And yet, the mere creation of the LNG reserve plan shows how
important the fuel is to the power and heating sector.
Managing a decline in demand over the mid to long-term is tricky. It seems that METI is
acting to create a buffer to counter the pace of withdrawal of Japanese buyers from the
LNG term market. Ironically, the withdrawal is guided by METI’s and the broader
government’s own indications of shrinking gas demand by 2030, especially in the power
mix.

Should the demand response not be strong enough, or other unforeseen events create an
additional need for LNG supply, Japan may find itself suddently overexposed to the spot
market at a time when contracted capacity may be limited. That’ll translate directly into
energy security risks and high power prices in a nation that doesn’t like sudden surprises.

ENERGY       JOBS   IN  JAPAN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Japan Is Open for Tourists, But How About Overseas Talent?

At the start of 2020, just as Japan was getting a new wave of overseas investment into
the energy sector via the upcoming auctions for offshore wind, Covid-19 hit the world
and locked down borders for over two years. Dozens of companies that planned to
expatriate experienced talent were not able to do so, whereas Japanese firms were
able to bring their own people back from where they had been gaining experience in
overseas markets.

This led to a high demand and low supply of experienced talent in key technical skill
sets during the pandemic. Not limited to offshore wind, other solutions such as VPP
technologies, battery storage and energy trading experts also confronted significant
demand but were limited by lockdowns.

Now that the world is open again, can Japan leverage global talent pools? Should
they do so? What limitations can companies and overseas experts expect in Japan?


Language barrier
Let’s start with the easy one. Japan is an island, and many aspects of business
operate in highly domestic ecosystems. Subcontractors, utilities, and many
engineering and survey firms will not have sufficient English-language capabilities to
be well engaged by non-Japanese speakers. As far as local stakeholder management
or negotiations, technical documentation and applications for permits? All in
Japanese.

Does this close the door to non-Japanese speaking talent? Not 100%. In areas where
the Japanese talent pool is in short supply, foreign expertise can be highly
valued. Companies must however, consider hiring and developing local resources to
complement overseas talent.


Expat / local balance
Can you have a team of all expats? In the early to mid 2010s we did see a number of
PV solar firms with very little Japanese talent. Developers, in large part from Europe,
came in with expertise that included EPC firms, as well as producers of modules, racks
and power conditioners (inverters).

For a brief moment in time, knowledge of Japanese was only needed for a few key
elements such as forestry permits, grid connections etc. The ‘Spanish Solar Mafia’
came and experienced success - however, this could not last forever. It was only a
matter of time for the Japanese to learn the solar business, build local expertise,
leverage bigger partnerships, lower cost of capital, and ultimately drive out much of
the early foreign solar players. Those who stayed have two things in common: Firstly,
they learned to speak Japanese, and secondly, they diversified their teams to have a
healthier expat / local balance.

If we look now at the offshore wind market, there are a number of foreign players who
have teams comprised primarily of expats and are relying on their Japanese
consortium partners for the local content, but this is the minority.

Most global players have a 10~20% contingent of expats and are building up the bulk
of the team with local talent. Expats bring real experience in various engineering
disciplines, project management, or in leading competitive tender bids.

Companies with longer term vision and plans for Japan are leveraging this expat
knowledge to hire, train and build out strong local capability for two reasons: Firstly,
they recognize the need for Japanese technical expertise and understanding of local
regulations, as well as language abilities to effectively work within this
ecosystem. Secondly, the market is growing at such a rapid rate globally that many
firms do not have enough talent to send to Japan; distributing skills among all key
markets is a topic to be tackled strategically and with care.


Are firms hiring overseas talent?
There are cases of energy companies hiring overseas talent with in-demand technical
skill sets from overseas. A number of these firms have invested in translation/
interpretation resources in-house to leverage this talent. Typically, the profile of these
companies have been Japanese firms playing in new markets (offshore wind, trading,
energy storage) that don’t have an expat pool to pull from and therefore have turned
to headhunting talent from global markets.

Another case where this is evident is the battery technology manufacturers. Japan
used to be the center of the world for battery technology, however there has been a
heavy talent leak to China and the U.S., with the impact compounded by Japan’s
aging population. This has led to opportunities for global talent in the research,
development and production areas as can be seen in firms such as Murata and AESC.


Technical limitations
Japan has various specific regulations and technical challenges, which are very
difficult, if not impossible to circumvent without knowledge of Japanese. Ask any
wind turbine manufacturer, ship operator or developer about Nippon Kaiji Kyokai
(ClassNK) and hear their challenges. Foreign electrical engineers can transfer a lot of
skills to Japan, until faced with the challenges of different technical requirements and
regulations for grid connection depending on the local utility and region.


Long-term expats
As we discussed above, there is real value for global firms to expatriate experts in
talent-starved areas. For the expat however, these assignments have an end date,
and some people wish to remain in Japan beyond that expiration date.

This is possible, as demonstrated by the hundreds of global citizens in the solar
community here, and a growing number in wind. To do so successfully, in almost all
cases you should learn Japanese to the business level!
In addition, understand your value. As an expat, your value is to bring expertise to
develop local capability, and to act as a communication bridge back to HQ. Once
you step out of that organization, you must add the same value. This means your next

26


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

employer should be a global firm that has struggled to understand the intricacies of
the Japan market, which you are quite knowledgeable of. You can act as a bridge and
help that new employer to build out or improve local capabilities.

Especially if we look at the executive and functional leadership level we can see many
examples of long-term, non-Japanese success cases.


Glass ceilings
Due to the technical and language limitations listed above, there are some glass
ceilings that can be hard (but not impossible) to break through. A frequent example
that best illustrates this is Site Engineers desiring to take on HQ Engineering
roles. Often, managing the construction site for a plant is a role well done by non-
Japanese, especially when leveraging major or global EPCs, contractors, vendors
etc. Though many of these professionals have strong engineering skills, they struggle
to make the move to Tokyo HQ and work on plant design, grid connections etc., as
the technical and language barriers are high.


Summary
There is certainly a place for global talent in the Japan market. The key is in the
supply and demand of the particular skill set and market niche that we are
considering. Secondarily, the Japanese are masters in mastering skills; just look at
their whiskey! This means that the window of opportunity in a particular niche is
always temporary. Once enough local capability is established, the need, and
therefore the value of the foreign talent will diminish, with the exception foreign talent
who invest in themselves to integrate better into Japanese society.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Canada/ Clean energy tech
PM Trudeau announced C$80 billion in tax credits for clean technology over the next
decade, including C$25 billion to develop clean electricity. Canada needs about
C$100 billion a year in clean tech investment to meet its net-zero emissions goal by
2050.

Czechia/ Nuclear power
Starting in 2024, Westinghouse will supply nuclear fuel to the Dukovany NPP of power
utility CEZ 2024, replacing Russia's TVEL, which had been the only source of fuel for
Dukovany's VVER reactors.

Indonesia/ Battery metals
Ford Motor Co plans to invest in a $4.5 billion battery materials plant together with
China’s Huayou Cobalt and Brazilian miner Vale. The plant will be located in Southeast
Sulawesi, where Vale operates a nickel mine. Indonesia has the world's biggest nickel
reserves.

Iraq/ Oil
Producers shut or reduced output at several oilfields. This impacts 450,000 bpd
through a pipeline that runs to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. Turkey stopped pumping
Iraqi crude after Baghdad won an arbitration case in which it said Ankara violated an
agreement by allowing the Kurdistan government to export oil without Baghdad's
consent.

EU/ Hydrogen power
Tense talks continue over how to classify hydrogen produced using nuclear power. It’s
part of a wider dispute over whether EU hydrogen policies should encourage nuclear
energy with subsidies and incentives, or give primacy to renewables technologies like
wind and solar.

Norway/ Offshore wind power
Tenders opened for two areas in the North Sea to build wind parks with 3 GW
capacity; this is a first step towards a goal of producing 30 GW by 2040. Soerlige
Nordsjoe II is suitable for bottom-fixed wind turbines. It will be developed in two
phases.

Philippines/ Biofuels
The Bases Conversion and Development Authority supports plans for a $250 million
waste-to-energy project in New Clark City in Tarlac. The project is jointly with
Plambeck Emirates, a JV between Plambeck Holdings (Germany) and the Royal Family
of Abu Dhabi.

UK/ SAF
The government recommended subsidies for production of low-carbon jet fuel made
from household waste. Producing SAF is about three times the price of normal jet fuel.
The UK announced £165 million in grants and will require at least 10% of jet fuel in
the UK — an estimated 1.5 billion liters — to be made from “sustainable sources” by
2030.

U.S./ Blue ammonia
Norway's fertiliser maker Yara and Canada’s pipeline company Enbridge will invest
$2.9 billion to build a blue ammonia production plant in Texas. It will be built at an
Enbridge oil storage and export facility near Corpus Christi; production starts in 2027.

Zimbabwe/ Floating solar power
China Energy Engineering Corp proposed a 1 GW floating solar plant on Kariba dam.
The country generates less than half of its 1.7 GW power demand; this is due to the
poor performance of its ageing coal-fired plants and low water levels that impact its 1
GW hydropower plant at Kariba.
