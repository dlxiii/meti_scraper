METI panel proposes carbon credit categories and disclosure format
(Japan NRG, March 24)
•  A METI panel for the carbon credit utilization framework proposes credit categories and attributes
that must be disclosed to verify the accountability of the credits. In its Carbon Credit Report, the
panel proposed to set four credit categories, as well as a disclosure framework of credits and how
they’re offset. METI will present the report for public consultation in April-May, which will be open

to international stakeholders. METI will accept comments in English.
•  The report did not elaborate on what the new national carbon exchange will trade. It said, "Both
players in the government and private sectors should pursue discussions toward creating a widely
open carbon credit market, including the trades of internationally recognized voluntary credits."
Since it has put voluntary credits with corresponding adjustments in the same category as
compliance credits, there’s a strong likelihood that voluntary credits clearing this requirement will
trade on the exchange.
• TAKEAWAY: See the Analysis section for the full story in context.

•  METI began accepting applications for corporate PPA subsidies to be implemented through a
supplementary budget for fiscal 2021. A total of ¥13.5 billion has been set aside for the subsidies,
which apply to solar projects that are outside of the feed-in tariff or feed-in premium schemes.
•  Applications will be accepted for four weeks, from March 28 to April 22.
•  The subsidies will cover up to one-half of the installation costs for new PV power generation

facilities with an output of 2 MW or more. The facilities can be distributed across multiple sites.
•  CONTEXT: Last year, MoE gave subsidies to 11 offsite solar corporate PPAs.


Offshore wind working group reaffirms Mitsubishi auction sweep after review

(Japan NRG, March 22)
•  After a review of the tender process, the METI and MLIT offshore wind working group said the
decision to award three offshore wind projects to the Mitsubishi-Chubu Electric consortium is
justifiable. The group rejected the notion that the low bids of the Mitsubishi-Chubu consortium
will discourage participation in future auctions.
•  There were, however, some selection criteria that didn’t reflect the capacities of auction
participants accurately, such as !the capacity to realize the project” and !the capacity to generate
new supply chains in the domestic market.”
•  To improve the process, all future auction participants will be required to show how their
approach impacts local businesses and how the supply chain will be built.


Antitrust lawyers, energy experts will study green competition law

(Japan NRG, March 25)
•  METI launched a new panel comprised of antitrust lawyers and energy economists to study
possible amendments to the Anti-Monopoly Act to speed up decarbonization. The regulations
should support business efforts to drive energy transition. The panel will discuss potential
competition issues and organize processes to achieve a green society.
•  The competition framework should continue to foster innovation. Large deals for the building
production facilities and the decarbonization of supply chains should be encouraged, because such

initiatives will contribute to net zero.
•  The panel held its first meeting on March 25. Attorney Manabu Noda, a panelist and a former
Japan Fair Trade Commission official, outlined practices that may conflict with Japanese
competition regulations.

•  The panelists will interview overseas experts in the second and third meetings in the next three
months.
•  Ohashi Hiroshi, a Tokyo University professor who serves the government power and gas sub-
committees and working groups, was named the panel chairman.
• TAKEAWAY: According to JERA, the costs of ammonia co-firing will be higher than renewables and won’t be

able to compete. JERA claimed the costs of building ammonia production facilities and ammonia raw material
procurement will comprise over half of total power generation costs. METI is pushing for the early roll-out of
ammonia and hydrogen co-firing at thermal power plants to resolve power supply shortages, notably in Tokyo
and Chubu areas while reducing their carbon footprint.

• Most competition issues are about large companies abusing their bargaining power to win concessions from
smaller businesses. Numerous complaints were filed to the Japan Fair Trade Competition by renewables,
alleging the regional power grids of abusing their positions. There could be a number of cases with large
manufacturers terminating contracts with small suppliers because their carbon footprints are high or because
they don’t use renewable power, which may be more controversial than allowing joint initiatives among big
manufacturers.



METI proposes carbon footprint data sharing for storage batteries

(Japan NRG, March 25)
•  METI proposed two approaches to measure the carbon footprint of storage batteries that cover
the entire supply chain, thus clearing competition regulations.
•  The emission data from cathode, anode and other parts makers that’s passed to downstream
manufacturers of batteries to automakers and other consumers could contain sensitive information.
•  METI proposes a system in the government or third-party organization to collect emission and

other relevant data, or to collect only the final emission figures from multi-layered suppliers.
•  METI plans to set up a system equivalent to “the battery passport” in the EU, where companies in
the supply chain share emission data.



Methanation Council releases interim report on recycled carbon counts
(Japan NRG, March 22)
•  The Methanation Council stated in a report the approaches to avoid double counting of carbon
cuts that could occur when recycling carbon to generate synthetic methane and when consuming
the said methane.
•  Japan, together with Australia, Norway, and the EU, are considering a new carbon count

framework to apply to International Maritime Organization (IMO) members. This is in addition to
the framework that aligns with the IPCC inventory methodology.
•  According to the IPCC guidelines, synthetic methane carbon inventory will be counted at the site
of consumption. Meanwhile, a separate standard is needed for counting carbon consumed on
ocean-going vessels.
•  Japan Iron and Steel Federation proposed “incentives” to both the producers and users of
synthetic methane. To avoid “double counting”, the national carbon inventory and carbon release

reports should be treated as separate systems, the federation proposed.

Chubu team develops technology for generating electricity from nuclear waste
(TV Tokyo, March 23)
•  A team from Chubu University developed technology that uses gamma radiation to reduce
magnetite particles suspended in water.
•  In the presence of a magnetic field, the effect can be used to generate electricity.

•  The process could harness radiation emitted by nuclear waste to generate electricity.
•  As the process is only around 0.1% efficient, the team hopes to boost its efficiency.



Synthetic methane to account for 1% of city gas by 2030, say utilities
(Denki Shimbun, March 23)
•  Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas, two of Japan’s biggest utilities, said that synthetic methane will account
for 1% of their city gas sales by 2030.
•  Japan’s government aims for the cleaner gas to make up 90% of national consumption by 2050.
Methanation is seen as the way to make the gas industry carbon neutral as it involves clean

hydrogen.
•  METI and ANRE issued a report on calculating CO2 emissions when synthetic methane is used. It
confirmed that methanation can help decarbonize the gas industry, but more incentives are
needed for a wider interest in the technology.



Idemitsu to test new ammonia manufacture process that halves cost
(Nikkei, March 24)
•  Idemitsu plans to test a new method of making ammonia that promises to halve costs. The oil
refining major is working with Toshiba, Nissan Chemical, and others to develop a large-scale
production method for synthesizing ammonia directly from water and air by the end of 2024.
•  The new approach relies on molybdenum as a catalyst and enables production at 20ºC and 1 atm

(room temperature and pressure), much less than the current heat-intensive manufacturing
process.


Osaka Gas to issue its first transition bonds

(Gas Energy News, March 21)
•  Osaka Gas will issue its first transition bond, to the tune of ¥10 billion and for a 10-years term. After
selecting a lead managing underwriter, the company plans to issue the bonds in May or later.
•  The proceeds will be used for wind power projects in Wakayama Prefecture, Aomori Prefecture
and Aomori Prefecture, and a natural gas supply project in Shikokuchuo City, Ehime Prefecture.
•  Tokyo Gas was due to issue ¥20 billion in transition bonds this month.
•  CONTEXT: Idemitsu also recently said it will issue transition bonds, potentially a first for the oil

industry in Japan.

Japan’s top life insurer to invest ¥500 billion in renewables, green bonds
(Kankyo Business, March 22)
•  Nippon Life Insurance Company, also known as Nissay, will establish an investment and loan facility
to encourage corporate efforts to decarbonize. The company will invest ¥500 billion in renewable

energy, green bonds, development of new technologies, and transition finance.
•  Of the total, approximately ¥20 billion will go to a "decarbonization fund of funds," ¥10 billion to a
"decarbonization venture investment fund," and ¥30 billion to a "renewable energy fund of
funds”.
•  Nissay has also set targets to reduce GHG from its asset portfolio by 2030.



Mihama nuclear reactor peripheral dismantling plan passes NRA review
(Japan NRG, March 23)
•  The Nuclear Regulatory Authority approved Kansai Electric’s plan to dismantle the peripheral of its
Mihama No. 1 and No. 2 nuclear reactors as the company refiled a more detailed plan. Kansai

Electric plans to decommission the two reactors.
•  The dismantling of the reactor peripherals will start in 2022, the reactor in 2036 and the plant
building in 2042. NRA said the company’s first filing stated plans to dismantle the peripherals, but
no further details were given. The revised filing elaborated on the deconstruction method and the
estimated amount of metal and concrete scrap generated.



IAEA conducts second analysis of Fukushima waste water
(Japan NRG, March 24)
•  On March 24, the IAEA visited TEPCO's nuclear plant in Fukushima to take water samples from the
Advanced Liquid Processing System for treating the contaminated water. They’ll be analyzed in the
IAEA laboratory to verify TEPCO's analysis. This is the second sampling since February. IAEA made

a website dedicated to water review.


METI to reform national R&D systems

(Japan NRG, March 22)
•  Starting in 2023, METI plans to reform the national R&D systems, changing the planning, financing,
management, and evaluation of applications. The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science
and Technology (AIST) will set up a unit to attract private sector funds. Currently, the private sector
contributes to 10% of AIST projects, which often involve large businesses. The new unit will seek
partners from small and medium sized enterprises and startups, and will also manage intellectual
property rights. METI will also change management and evaluation of R&D projects, introducing
competition and incentive payments based on results, rather than processes. The Green Innovation

Fund for decarbonization technology development functions on a competitive basis, and grants
will be cut off if progress is slower than the agreed targets. This approach will be applied to other
METI R&D projects in 2023.
•  CONTEXT: Quantum computing and AI are the focus technologies, and their applications in
energy include power distribution systems.

Tokyo Gas to boost investments 30% next year on renewables rollout
(Denki Shimbun, March 24)
•  Tokyo Gas will boost spending 30% to ¥367.8 billion next fiscal year. Investment will go to
renewables and overseas businesses.
•  The gas utility expects electricity sales to grow 24.9% to 34.8 billion kWh next year as some smaller

power retail firms leave the market or fold due to the volatility. Tokyo Gas expects to do more
business in extra-high and high-voltage power, said Managing Executive Officer Sato Hirofumi.



Osaka Gas to study potential for methanation project in Singapore
(Denki Shimbun, March 22)
•  Osaka Gas will begin a feasibility study for a methanation project in Singapore. The project will
generate synthetic methane from hydrogen procured from inside and outside Singapore as well as
CO2 collected internally. The gas would supply the local community through existing pipelines.
•  The firm will study the economics of the project over the next six months.
•  Local gas supplier, City Energy, will work with Osaka Gas on the study.



Idemitsu tests new asphalt using recycled CO2

(Sekiyu Tsushin, March 22)
•  Idemitsu Kosan held a test paving of asphalt using synthetic calcium carbonate. The material was
made using carbon recycling technology that synthesizes CO2 from boiler exhaust gas and calcium
contained in concrete waste.
•  By using synthetic calcium carbonate instead of crushed limestone, which is used as an asphalt mix
material, the company said it can reduce CO2 on roads.

Cold snap strains Tokyo grid and leads to first-ever call to conserve power
(Japan NRG, March 22)
•  Tokyo’s grid operator, TEPCO, asked users to save power first on March 18 and again on March
22, when a cold snap caused a rare case of snow in Tokyo.
•  As cold weather and snow hit Tokyo and the northern Tohoku region, TEPCO reported demand at
107% of supply at 2pm on March 22.
•  The company received surplus electricity from four regions (Hokkaido, Chubu, Kansai and Tohoku),

but still told users to save power and to expect blackouts. This was the first time such a message
was broadcast for the Tokyo area.
•  METI and TEPCO asked homes and workplaces to keep thermostats at 20ºC and turn off
unnecessary lighting. Some companies sent workers home early. A steel mill halted work.
•  Electricity prices more than doubled to ¥80/ kWh on March 22.
•  The emergency power savings measure was relaxed the next day as temperatures went up.

Support from grids outside of Tokyo resumed March 23.

Power crisis is a sign of overly-optimistic modeling
(Tokyo Shimbun, March 23)
o  CONTEXT; This is an opinion by the Tokyo Shimbun editorial committee.
o  On March 21, in response to forecasts for unseasonably cold weather, Japan’s

government issued its first-ever power shortage warning to electricity consumers
supplied by TEPCO and Tohoku Electric.
o  Power supplies have been tight ever since a March 16 earthquake knocked several of
Tohoku Electric’s power plants off-line.
o  Cold snaps this time of year aren’t new. A harsh winter was forecasted; energy
companies should be able to more accurately predict electricity shortages.
o  If the warning had been issued half a day earlier, it would have been possible to conserve

power by reducing train frequencies, shutting down production lines, and encouraging
large employers to allow staff to work from home.
o  Instead, the warning came hours before pumped hydro reserves were due to run out.
o  METI and the Meteorological Agency must work more closely with power companies and
private sector consumers to better manage power shortages.
o  Smarter pooling of Japan’s energy resources, combined with cooperation between the

public and private sectors on energy conservation, will ensure ample electricity.
o  We also need to end once and for all any knee-jerk calls for more nuclear plants
whenever there is a power shortage.



Half of big power utilities to raise electricity rates in May
(Asia Nikkei, March 22)
•  TEPCO and four other Japanese power companies plan to raise electricity rates this May in a ninth
straight month of hikes.
•  The rising cost of LNG used as fuel for power plants is the main cause.



Mayor of town Shimane reactor gives tentative approval for restart
(Asahi Shimbun, March 25)
•  The city of Unnan, Shimane Prefecture, has announced its intention to agree to the restart of

Chugoku Electric’s Shimane Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2, stating at a city council meeting that "the
current situation is unavoidable.
•  The city presented its thoughts on the restart at the all-council meeting, stating that "until a stable
supply of renewable energy is available, we have no choice but to rely on it on the basic premise
of ensuring safety," and that "the government and Chugoku Electric's idea of reducing
dependence on thermal power generation is reasonable.”
•  The committee also called on the national government to quickly shift away from its dependence

on nuclear power plants.
• TAKEAWAY: Two of the three cities close to the NPP have now given their consent for a restart. The
prefectural governor will make the final decision after all municipalities give their approval. The NPP has been
offline for more than 10 years now with its restart delayed partly due to a reportedly strong distrust among the
local population towards plant operator, Chugoku Electric.

• If successful, the restart would see the first for a BWR type reactor since the Fukushima disaster. All the plants
online today are PWR type units.

• PM Kishida said last week that his government will back restarts as long as they are approved by the nuclear
watchdog, whose standards he stressed are the highest in the world, and after local authorities give their
consent.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Keidanren calls for urgent restart of nuclear plants
(Asahi Shimbun, March 22)
o  Referring to the government’s warning about power shortages, Keidanren chair Tokura
Masakazu said that if Japan’s idle nuclear power plants were not promptly restarted, the
outcome would be disastrous.
o  Tokura said all idle plants that did not face safety issues or opposition from local

residents must be restarted immediately to ensure sufficient supply.
o  Tokura explained that the warning was triggered due to forecasts for surplus capacity
falling below 3%, and said both private sector and individual consumers had to
cooperate to conserve electricity.



Happou-Noshiro wind farm auction dates to change
(Japan NRG, March 18)
•  In a bid to increase post-Ukraine conflict energy security, METI plans to change the deadline and
criteria of the Happou-Noshiro wind farm auction to speed up renewable project launches. The

auction opened on Dec. 10 and will close on June 10 this year.
•  The offshore wind working group, a joint panel of METI’s power and gas committee and the
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s port committee, began discussing the new
deadline, reviewing standards and other details on March 22.
•  There is no date when the decisions will be announced. METI will also advance selection of sites
for additional offshore wind farms.

(New Energy Business News, March 25)
•  Marubeni Corporation has signed a partnership agreement with the renewable energy subsidiary
of British energy major BP for the joint development of offshore wind power in Japan and projects

aimed at decarbonization, including hydrogen.
•  As a first step, the two companies agreed that BP will take a 49% stake in a special purpose
company wholly owned by Marubeni for the joint development of one offshore wind power
project.
•  The partnership was formed with BP Alternative Energy Investments Limited. In connection with
this partnership, BP will establish a new offshore wind development team in Japan.
•  CONTEXT: Marubeni is conducting environmental impact assessment procedures for projects off

the coast of Ishikari City, Hokkaido, and off the coast of Yusa Town, Yamagata Prefecture (jointly
with Kansai Electric).



Itochu plans 494 MW offshore wind plan in Yamagata

(New Energy Business News, March 24)
•  MOE released its opinion on the environmental assessment report for the "Landing-type offshore
wind power generation project off the coast of Yusa-machi, Akumi-gun, Yamagata Prefecture"
planned by Itochu Corp. The report calls for avoiding or minimizing the impact on birds due to
collisions with wind power generation facilities and obstructions to their migration.
•  Itochu plans an offshore wind power project at maximum capacity of 494 MW, consisting of 52

turbines, each with an output of between 9,500 kW and 15,000 kW, to be installed in an area of
approximately 3,420 ha. That area is categorized as a "promising area" under the Renewable
Energy Sea Area Utilization Law.

WAR IN UKRAINE:
Japan and France to freeze investments in Russia’s Arctic LNG projects
(Nikkei, March 25)

o  Japan and France froze new investment in Arctic LNG 2 in Russia.
o  Financial institutions can’t remit money to the project due to sanctions against Russia.
Thus, the start of operations scheduled for 2023 may be delayed.
o  This is the first freeze of new investments in Russian resources by Japan, which is
reviewing its LNG procurement strategy.
o  CONTEXT: Japan's Mitsui & Co. and Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation
(JOGMEC) have a combined stake of 10% in the $20 billion Arctic LNG 2 project led by

Novatek and includes France’s TotalEnergies.
o  Total said it won’t fund Arctic LNG 2 but will retain its concession. Even if it wanted to
give up its stake, it would struggle to find a buyer outside of Russia.

CFO Sato said.
o  The gas company is proceeding with trial calculations for alternative procurement.
o  Tokyo Gas is in contact with the government and if Japan makes the decision to stop
buying Russian LNG then the company will comply. However, the company is concerned
about security of supply and needs to have volumes to provide its customers, the CFO

said.
o  CONTEXT: ~10% of Tokyo Gas supplies come from the Russian Sakhalin II LNG project.

o  The CEO of a major Japanese gas company urges against going along with anti-Russian
sanctions, saying that any interruption to the LNG supply from Sakhalin would drive some
Japanese gas companies to insolvency.
o  With President Putin threatening to nationalize the assets of businesses that pull out of
Russia, this is a difficult call to make.
Russia invaded Ukraine months after the EU declared natural gas a “clean” form of

Japan’s March 20 LNG stocks slip to 1.68m tons
(Japan NRG, March 23)
•  Japan's LNG stocks stood at 1.68 million tons on March 20, down from 1.72 million tons a week
ago. Stocks at the end of March last year were 2.41 million tons and the four-year average of end-

March stocks were 2.19 million tons.


Japan pays highest price for LNG after quake pushes utilities to restock

(Bloomberg, March 25)
•  Tohoku Electric purchased an LNG cargo for late April to early May delivery to Japan at about $39/
mmbtu, among the most expensive ever purchased by a Japanese LNG importer.
•  The tender held by the utility for LNG specified that the cargo can’t come from Russia, the first
time the country has been specifically banned in an LNG tender.
•  The utility seeks additional gas supplies after several large coal-fired power plants were taken
offline by the strong earthquake earlier this month.
•  JERA, Japan’s top power producer, was another of the nation’s utilities to jump into the spot LNG

market in March to secure extra cargos. Kansai Electric and Kyushu Electric may also seek to buy in
the spot market.
• TAKEAWAY: Dipping into the spot market to add extra LNG supplies isn’t a big deal for Japanese utilities,
were it not for the situation in Europe. Depleted European reserves and fears that Russia will stop supplying
the region with gas has pushed the EU and UK to rely heavily on spot LNG purchases. With global supply
extremely tight, this means Japan and Europe are bidding against each other for the same fuel, promoting

higher prices that cause economic troubles for both. One potential solution is for Europe to secure new long-
term supply contracts, which would make it less reliant on the spot market. That is already starting to happen
with the U.S. committing millions of tons of LNG to Europe. But unless or until other big suppliers such as
Qatar sign deals with Europe, the spot market will remain very elevated and, as a result, Japan’s power prices
will likely continue to trade at prices 3-5 times above the 5-year average.

Shhh… Don’t Tell Anyone, but Japan’s About to Launch
Its First-Ever National Carbon Exchange

Japan will soon unveil its first-ever national carbon pricing exchange, starting with a
soft launch to ease the mechanism into business life. The exchange is expected to run
a hybrid model, combining a voluntary cap-and-trade scheme with a platform for
trading carbon credits.

Although lagging carbon trading developments in Europe by two decades, Japan’s
government aims to create an international hub open to overseas players and credits.
It will also allow for trade in both compliance and voluntary credits.

The move could become one of the most important developments in Japan’s power
industry since market liberalization, assigning a value to emissions that should
encourage businesses to lower their CO2 footprint and improve the economics for
clean energy projects. And yet, the fanfare around the launch has been toned down.

With the war in Ukraine sending already high energy prices to record levels, the
government has focused on near-term ways to rein in electricity and fuel costs,
including via oil subsidies. It is wary of companies that perceive the new market as an
additional burden.


In a league of its own
In February, METI opened applications to businesses interested in joining Japan’s first
carbon credits exchange. With opinions on how this market should operate and what
it should include very much divided among businesses and academia, the ministry
decided on a soft launch from April 2022 and an easing-in period.

First, the initial wave of participants will focus on debating the practical rules and
standards for the new institution. Trial run of credit trading would start this fall with a
limited number of participants.

With the first part of launch crucial before full operations commence in April 2023,
METI is banking on the first wave of exchange applicants to be companies that are
especially strongly committed to climate action, and which are prepared to put in the
effort to make the new market work. The first wave of companies will even have their
own moniker: they will be known as members of the “Green Transformation (GX)
League.”

These GX pioneers are expected to motivate peers and supply chain partners,
spreading word about the initiative into the broader business sphere. Once the
exchange opens fully in 2023, it will be open to all companies, not only the GX
evangelists.

Few details about the exchange are known, other than that it’ll incorporate a variation
of a cap-and-trade scheme and allow for trading credits forged not only in Japan but
also abroad. This will help Japanese businesses with overseas assets to claim credits in
cleaning up global operations.

A METI panel, formed in December to design carbon credit framework, did not
provide further clarity. But in a March 24 report it said: “Both players in the
government and private sectors should pursue discussions toward creating a widely
open carbon credit market that will include trade in internationally recognized
voluntary credits."


The cream of the climate crop
The GX League is open to any business of any size in any industry. This includes
overseas companies with activities in Japan. To join, companies need to disclose:
●  Annual and 2030 reduction goals (a self-imposed “cap”), actual annual
emissions; and if credits were used to achieve the goal, then the details
●  Initiatives to create carbon-neutral supply chains, including support offered to
upstream and downstream partners
●  How their products and services contribute to carbon neutrality
●  Engagement with civil society around carbon neutrality

At a recent briefing, a METI official behind the GX League stressed its open nature.
He added that while the government won’t conduct checks to review how companies
have met the above criteria, METI hopes other pressure mechanisms related to
climate disclosure will lead companies to set ambitious “voluntary caps”.

Applications to the GX League close on March 31. In a bid to attract companies from
every sector, METI sent invitations and information to all Japanese industry
associations.

As of March 23, some 24 companies said they would join. These range from regional
power grids and multinational financial groups to private consultancies. They are
predominantly existing buyers and brokers of J-Credits, the Japanese state-
administered carbon crediting system that has existed for over a decade but seen
relatively little uptake.

Mitsuwa Holdings and Tokyo-based booost technologies told Japan NRG they plan
to engage in the new market as J-Credit suppliers by starting forest conservation
projects. Apart from Mizuho Financial Group, which has partnered with the
International Finance Corporation, GX League companies have almost no exposure to
voluntary credits.

In comparison, 320 companies have signed up for METI’s Zero Emission program,
another carbon neutrality initiative that encourages companies to disclose their
technologies used to reduce their CO2 footprint.

The muted response so far is due to the extensive engagement that METI requires of
GX evangelists. They’re expected to get involved in “carbon rule-making in general,”
which includes setting standards for “carbon offset” labels on consumer products,
outlining an approach to blue carbon, and keeping current with new carbon capture
technologies, and etc.

Companies are given the chance to become climate change ambassadors,
communicating best practices to their customers and the wider world. In return, GX
evangelists have the privilege to transform emission cuts into credits that they can

monetize on the exchange. METI also promises to promote these companies to boost
their profile in financial and labor markets.

Among potential perks, METI is considering giving GX firms preferential treatment in
public tenders, grant applications and other government-run projects.


Unresolved issues
The vision for Japan’s carbon exchange is clear. METI hopes it will attract global green
capital and high-quality voluntary credits from overseas; and that its published prices
will have an impact beyond Japanese borders. To this end, the exchange will align
closely with the decisions of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets
(TSVCM).

Mixing voluntary and compliance credits will see both Japan’s own J-Credits and Joint
Crediting Mechanism (JCM) credits mingle with overseas contracts. METI, however,
wants to see the evolution of a baseline-and-credit system, in which polluters can earn
credits for cutting their CO2 emissions, even for those whose “baseline” emissions are
not fixed.

Bringing this vision to reality is more complicated. Debates over what constitutes
“high quality” voluntary credits continue, and not just in Japan. There’s also
inadequate infrastructure to verify the quality of credits. How that will be resolved and
who is responsible is also not clear.

Furthermore, Japan has yet to clarify the tax and accounting position of a carbon
credit. Also, the METI panel has proposed to create four credit categories (see News
section) and urged relevant parties to pursue further discussions.

Continued war in Ukraine, which has put into question the security of key
commodities, means that many Japanese energy-intensive companies, notably the
heavy emitters outside the power sector, may be wary of joining a new scheme in the
near-term unless there are immediate benefits. Yet, the government knows that it
can’t offer GX pioneers carte-blanche in rule-making and the power to create tradable
credits without strong underlying evidence. Doing so would undermine trust in the
new market.

Striking a balance will be tough. Yet pushing back decision-making is also not an
option. The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will become effective
from 2023. That will expand the carbon pricing structures of the EU beyond its
borders. If Japan fails to create its own platform, it will have to follow rules set
elsewhere.

See next page for a table of the firms that have already signed up for the GX League.

As a Leader in Solar, Japan Seeks Solutions To Recycle
And to Prolong PV Panel Lifespan


From strawberry farms to rooftops of convenience stores and factories, Japan is
looking for novel ways and new technologies to put aging solar panels to good use.
This is a daunting task since the amount of equipment nearing the end of its life cycle
will soar in coming years.

With installed solar capacity of 67 GW, Japan ranks third in the world after China and
the U.S., according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. In 2020 alone,
Japan added 8.67 GW of solar power that covered residential, commercial, industrial
and floating PV systems.

Japan was a pioneer in the development of solar panels, and manufacturers such as
Sharp and Kyocera led global production before Chinese competitors muscled their
way into the market. Earlier installations in Japan were mostly residential, thanks to a
government program started in 2009 to buy excess power from rooftop solar panels.

Then, the industry’s focus shifted to large-scale solar power plants after the feed-in
tariff program began to boost the share of renewables amid growing calls for
diversifying energy sources after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.

Solar recycling, however, still needs to be developed in terms of technology and
policy. In 2016, the MoE released a guideline for panel recycling, reuse and disposal.
The ministry followed up in May 2021 with a guideline that specifically promoted the
reuse of solar panels.


The early 2030s will be critical
The lifespan of a solar panel is typically 20 to 30 years. However, an inverter, which
converts the sun’s direct current power to alternating current so the solar electricity
can be used in homes, might only last about 10 to 15 years.

Currently, most spent panels are sent to landfills. The New Energy and Industrial
Technology Development Organization (NEDO) included the development of
recycling technologies among the five key challenges to further expand solar power in
its “NEDO PV Challenges 2020,” a solar development strategy. Panels with less
degradation should be reused, while developing recycling technology is essential for
end-of-life panels in order to recover valuable materials.

These days, since most panels in Japan still have many years before the end of their
lifecycle, those panels that are dismantled have been damaged in disasters such as
landslides and typhoons.

Still, in the early 2030s, Japan will start to see an increase in the number of PV panels
at the end of their lifespan. According to a NEDO estimate, the total volume of spent
panels will reach about 22,000 tons in 2030, peaking at about 170,000 to 280,000
tons in 2036, representing about 1.7% to 2.7% of the nation’s total industrial waste.

That industrial waste figure is no paltry amount, and it hammers home the fact that
green energy also has its waste issues and potential negative environmental impact
that must be confronted sooner rather than later.


Opportunity in old panels
A solar panel is made of cells sandwiched between layers
of glass and encapsulation film. Since the layers are tightly
sealed to endure long-term outdoor use, it’s difficult to
tear them apart. A typical module is 60% glass and 15%
aluminum frame in weight, so the key to recycling is how to
recover glass from other materials at low cost.

NEDO realizes there’s a need for a PV panel recovery plan
to guide waste disposal companies. However, not all the
recovered glass can be recycled, because some glass
contains antimony and arsenic, which are used to improve

For some companies, the coming surge in old panels means opportunity. The Japan
Photovoltaic Energy Association has a list of companies that recycle solar panels.
Currently, they total 32 in number, including Toshiba Environmental Solutions and
ORIX Eco Service.

Solar panels can be dismantled to recover useful materials, or can enjoy a second life
if deemed still safe to use. Here are some examples of what Japanese companies are
doing to give old panels a second life or efficiently recover materials rather than send
them to landfills:

REUSE
• ITES specializes in analysis and reliability evaluation. It’s developed a device to
quickly evaluate if a panel is still good for power generation. This is important
because the lack of effective and inexpensive ways to evaluate old panels has
hindered reuse.


RECOVERY OF MATERIALS
• Shinryo, a unit of Mitsubishi Chemical, is building a panel recycling factory slated
to start operations in April. From 1 MW worth of solar panels, the factory can
recover 10 tons of aluminum from frames; 38 tons of glass wool from glass; 1 ton
of silver and copper from cells and copper wiring.
• Marubeni began a pilot project in June 2021 to recycle and reuse panels, and it’s
also studying the use of glass recovered from used panels to grow strawberries.
The recovered material is burned at high temperature to turn it into porous glass,
which, when mixed with regular soil, improves water retention and ventilation.
• Niimi Solar Company obtained a patent for a machine that recovers materials
from solar panels at a high recycling ratio using high temperature vapor (at 600 C
or higher). It is the first machine to use vapor to dismantle panels.
• Solar Frontier said in 2021 that it was halting solar panel production, has been
working to develop recycling technology with NEDO. The company aims to
reduce the recycling cost to ¥3/ watt, regardless of the types of solar panels, and
recycle more than 90% of materials in a panel. The company plans to start its
recycling business as early as 2024 and initially to process about 30,000 panels a
year.

INSURANCE
• Sompo Japan, an insurance company, began offering solar panel insurance that
promotes reuse and recycling of PV panels. Under the provision, a solar power
generator is matched with companies that check and determine the quality of
panels damaged by natural disasters. If panels are found still usable, the cost of
disposal is reduced.


State participation
In anticipation of the approaching peak years, some local governments are studying
how to efficiently collect and recycle panels. Here’s a sample of measures taken by
local and central governments:

•  Saitama Prefecture, with Japan’s second largest residential solar capacity, did
a pilot project in late 2021 to collect 400 panels free of charge. The goal is to
determine the quality of a panel and study efficient ways of panel collection.
•  In July, Fukuoka Prefecture began the nation’s first panel collection system.
Companies that discard, transport and recycle solar panels share information
on a cloud network regarding quantity, locations and types of panels for
efficient recycling.

•  The Tokyo Metropolitan Government set up a study group on panel recycling
and it’ll soon release a report.
•  In September, METI established guidelines for a reserve fund for solar panel
disposal amid concerns about illegal dumping of panels at the end of their
lifecycle. In response to the low rate of solar power generators that set aside
money for disposal, the government revised the law to require them to pay
into the program.

While there’s still a decade before Japan reaches a critical moment in solar panel
recycling — due to the lifespan finale of a critical mass of PV panels in the early 2030s
— the groundwork for tackling that problem needs to be established now. One
solution, obviously, is to find ways to extend panels’ lifespan as much as possible.

In addition to that, Japan will have to further develop and hone plans and guidelines
for recycling PV panels that have exhausted all possible usage. At the very least, such
recycling efforts present an excellent business opportunity for both solar power
companies and companies that focus on industrial waste.

Aside from the above financial considerations, however, the most important
underlying issue at stake is that in order to be a truly green energy source, the solar
power industry must confront its own waste issues and find sustainable solutions. If it
doesn’t, then detractors will always ask — just how ‘green’ is solar energy?

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Battery storage
AGL Energy received state approval for its 500 MW grid-scale battery, which will have
up to four hours of storage, or a total of 2 GWh. The $763 million battery complex will
be built in three stages running until 2024.

Australia/ Green hydrogen
Iron mining billionaire Andrew Forrest claims his newly-formed Fortescue Future
Industries will produce 15 million tons of green hydrogen a year by 2030. Currently,
only around 1 million tons of green hydrogen is produced in the world. Fortescue’s
target requires about 200 GW of new wind and solar power capacity.

Brazil/ Wind power
Oil major Shell applied for environmental investigation licenses to build 6 offshore
wind projects with total installed capacity of 17 GW. Brazil currently has about 21 GW
of wind power capacity, ranking 7th in the world.

China/ Energy policy
As part of efforts to balance energy security with climate change goals, the 14th Five-
Year Plan (2021-25) announced last week calls for increasing renewable energy
sources and nuclear power production, but also promotes the exploration and
development of shale oil and shale gas.
Germany/ Energy relief
A relief package worth about €16 billion was approved to ease the impact of rising
energy costs on consumers. Measures include a three-month fuel price cut, as well as
a temporary increase in the use of coal to generate energy.

Norway/ Renewable energy
Majority state-owned Equinor says renewables will power 10% of its energy output in
2030; oil and gas will make up the remaining 90%. The company plans as much as 16
GW of renewables capacity by 2030, up from 0.5 GW in 2020, and mainly due to new
offshore wind capacity.

Saudi Arabia/ Fossil fuels
Aramco will allocate up to $50 billion in capital expenditure, primarily for the
upstream sector for oil and gas. The company’s 2021 income more than doubled to
$110 billion. Capital expenditure in 2021 was $31.9 billion.

Solar power
Rystad Energy expects global rooftop solar PV capacity to double by 2025, reaching
95 GW. Annual rooftop installations increased from 36 GW in 2017 to 59 GW by early
2022. China drove this growth - its rooftop installations rose from 19.4 GW in 2017, to
27.3 GW in 2021.

Vietnam/ LNG
South Korea’s Samsung C&T made a JV with Lilama to build one of Vietnam’s first
LNG-powered energy stations. The $940 million deal calls for building two 750 MW
plants — Nhon Trach 3 and 4 — in the province of Dong Nai. They will be operational
by 2025.

U.S./ Renewable energy
The State of Virginia approved new solar and energy storage projects for Dominion
Energy totaling almost 1 GW in capacity. In Oklahoma, the 356-turbine, 998 MW
Traverse wind farm began operations. Meanwhile, California approved a 10-year plan
to improve grid resiliency and meet clean energy targets, which will cost $2.9 billion.
The plan calls for 2.7 GW of renewable energy capacity to be built each year.

U.S./ Natural gas
Plans for a 1.6 GW natural gas-fueled power plant in the State of Virginia were
scrapped after six years of trying to bring the project to fruition. The developer,
Chickahominy Power, blamed lobbyists from the renewable energy industry, and said
it might relocate the project to Ohio.

Wind power
The ZEBRA (Zero wastE Blade ReseArch) consortium has produced the first prototype
of its 100% recyclable wind turbine blade. The 62-meter blade is made with
Elium® resin, which is known for recyclable properties and which is made by French
chemical company, Arkema.
