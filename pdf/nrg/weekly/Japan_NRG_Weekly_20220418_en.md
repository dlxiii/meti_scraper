Kishida enthusiastic on pan-Asian green initiative
(Nikkei, April 14)
•  CONTEXT: This opinion piece is by Shimizu Masato, a member of the editorial committee.
•  Japan must balance energy security with the need to reduce carbon emissions.
•  PM Kishida advocates creating an “Asia Zero Emissions Community”, in which Japan will share
expertise in hydrogen, ammonia, and other green technologies with other Asian nations to help

build green infrastructure and reduce carbon emissions.
•  When asked if he saw China as a member, Kishida said he didn’t, and rather envisaged an ASEAN-
centered community.
•  Southeast Asia’s climate makes the region less suited to solar or wind generation. Meanwhile,
exporting nuclear power plants would breach nuclear non-proliferation obligations. This is why PM
Kishida is enthusiastic about ammonia and hydrogen.
•  But ammonia and hydrogen supply chains have yet to be built, and controversy marks the carbon

reduction levels required for a technology to be branded “green”.



TotalEnergies and ENEOS to explore Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in Japan
(New Energy Business News, April 15)
•  ENEOS and France’s TotalEnergies will conduct a feasibility study for production of Sustainable

Aviation Fuel (SAF) at ENEOS’ Negishi Refinery in Yokohama.
•  The study will focus on commercialization of SAF production by utilizing idle production facilities
and raw materials at the Negishi site, which include biomass, waste cooking oil and tallow.
•  The two companies are considering a JV that might launch by 2025.
•  The Negishi Refinery is close to major sites of aviation fuel demand, including the Narita and
Haneda airports.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Climate business lobby meets with PM to promote renewables, carbon pricing

(Kankyo Business, April 8)
•  The Japan Climate Leaders Partnership (JCLP), which represents 206 companies, met with PM
Kishida and gave him a "Position Paper on Overcoming the Climate Crisis through New
Capitalism.”
•  CONTEXT: Kishida came into power on a platform called “New Capitalism”, which promises more
focus on income equality.
•  The group said that for Japan to meet climate targets, action is needed that complies with the
1.5°C climate warming roadmap. Specifically, the country should (1) adjust its systems to give

priority to renewable energy, and (2) introduce carbon pricing, to recognize the social costs of
climate impact.
•  The PM accepted the proposal and wants the JCLP to continue playing an important role in
communicating its ideas to society.


Japan to create bio jet fuel supply chain in clean energy push

(Nikkei Asia, April 14)
•  Japan will develop a supply network for bio jet fuel, to make the fuel available across the country
next year. The government will take the lead in importing the eco-friendly fuel and building
storage facilities.
•  Infrastructure for handling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will first be built at Chubu Centrair
International Airport in Aichi Prefecture. The hub will be used for a two-month trial of bio jet fuel.
Later, SAF will spread to other airports.

•  CONTEXT: Japanese airlines are under pressure to use SAF since it’s mandatory in other regions,
but costs are several times higher than for conventional jet fuel.
•  Itochu will import the fuel for the trials from Finland's Neste.


KDDI, mobile and data conglomerate, brings forward net-zero pledge by 20 years

(Kankyo Business, April 8)
•  KDDI aims for net-zero CO2 emissions by FY2030, which is 20 years ahead of its previous
declaration. In addition, KDDI seeks to achieve zero CO2 emissions at its data centers globally by
FY2026.

Can carbon storage overcome cost hurdles?

(Nikkei, April 13)
•  The International Energy Agency says that in addition to the 27 carbon capture, use, and storage
projects in operation globally, an unprecedented 163 are in the pipeline.
•  The growth of the CCUS market is a boon for heavy industry, which is well-placed to provide the
necessary separation, recovery, transport and pressurization services.
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Toshiba are pursuing initiatives to

recover CO2 produced by power stations and factories.
•  JGC, INPEX, JAPEX, and Idemitsu are involved in initiatives to store CO2 underground or under
the seafloor. Mitsui OSK Lines and Mitsubishi Shipbuilding are developing CO2 transport vessels.
•  While enhanced oil recovery, which involves the injection of pressurized CO2 into depleted oil
wells, is not new, the technique requires drilling injection borewells, and high costs meant few
operators seriously pursued the technique until recently.

•  While the technology remains expensive, competition in the global CCUS market is such that
Japanese industry can’t afford to take a “wait-and-see” approach.
•  A recent METI trial in Hokkaido reported costs of over ¥11,000 per metric ton of CO2 sequestered,
half of which went to dig the bore well and inject the CO2.
•  The IEA projects 6.9 billion tons of CO2 needs to be sequestered by 2070 to achieve carbon

neutrality by 2050; the world will face astronomical CCUS bills unless ways are found to make the
technology cheaper.

OCCTO  warns Tokyo’s power shortage will be more critical next winter
(Japan NRG, April 12)
•  The Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO), which is
METI’s agency for power transmission, warned that Tokyo’s power shortage will be more critical
next winter as demand exceeds supply by 2.5 GW in a worst weather scenario.
•  Supply will be limited as Shinchi No. 1 (1 GW) and No. 2 (1 GW) coal power stations, which

suffered damages from the March earthquake, will remain closed. The closure, until next January-
February, of Genkai No. 3 (1.18 GW) and No.4 (1.18 W) nuclear plants in Kyushu will also tighten
national power supply.
•  Tokyo’s power reserve rate would be -1.7% in January and -1.5% in February, way below the
minimum requirement of 3%.
•  Newly constructed thermal power plants in soft runs, and IGCC coal plants under care and
maintenance could be brought on-stream. But it is risky to count them as reliable power sources,

OCCTO said, adding that demand-side efforts to cut power consumption are required.

First ever solar curtailment orders from Shikoku Electric and Tohoku Electric

(Japan NRG, April 11)
•  For the first time ever, Shikoku Electric and Tohoku Electric utilities limited the amount of wind and
solar energy that can be fed into their network, citing risks of widespread power cuts if supply
outstrips demand.
•  Shikoku put 150 MW of power capacity on output control during peak supply period from 12:30-
13:00. That’s how much supply outstripped demand. Of the 4.65 GW of capacity online at the
time, 2.45 GW was from renewable energy.
•  Tohoku Electric put 110 MW of capacity from 21 power generators on output control for 11:30-

12:00, less than curtailment plans reported a day earlier due to lower than forecast output from
solar and wind generators.
•  CONTEXT: Curtailment of renewables operators in Kyushu has occurred for the last five years, but
this is a first in other regions. Grid operators say they need to ask renewables operators to cut back
during peak supply times to balance the system.




Hokuriku Electric forecasts wind capacity to surpass solar in 2030
(Japan NRG, April 12)
•  Hokuriku Electric will have more wind capacity than solar by 2030, as more onshore wind power
stations are built in north Ishikawa Prefecture. By 2030, wind power capacity will reach 1.61 GW;
solar capacity will reach 1.5 GW. By end of 2031, wind will grow to 1.75 GW; solar will reach 1.52
GW. Currently, solar is the region’s main renewable power source, with 1.16 GW capacity, while
wind has 170 MW.

Nuclear regulator pushes Hokkaido Electric to step up safety measures

(Japan NRG, April 13)
•  The Nuclear Regulation Authority chief told Hokkaido Electric that the Kashiwa nuclear power plant
inspection needs to improve communications. “There are issues that need a lot of focus and we
want them to let us know if they’ve caught the ball that we threw… it will be a waste of time if they
come to us after completing a procedure and we tell them, ‘this is not what we meant’,” NRA chief
Fuketa told reporters.
•  He added that the grid needs to increase the number of safety staff. “Nuclear safety is not a

process that gets done when they clear regulatory requirements, but it’s a continual process to
brace for potential earthquakes,” he added.

Japan to push more upstream LNG investment: METI minister

(Japan NRG, April 15)
•  METI minister Hagiuda said Japan will push for more upstream gas investment including capacity
expansion of gas fields currently in production. JOGMEC will provide financing.
•  Separately, METI told the Green Transformation Panel that it will strictly monitor coal imports to
phase out Russian coal, which accounts for 11% of Japan’s supply. It will urge Australia and
Indonesian coal suppliers to guarantee supply to Japan.
•  Separately, METI told the Green Transformation Panel on April 14 that it will closely monitor coal
imports and speed up efforts to find substitutes to Russian coal, and will modify the power

generation framework to allow quick restarts of idled thermal power plants. A severe power
shortage is forecast for next winter, so some businesses are constructing their own solar and
battery-based generation plants, the minister said, adding that it will be regrettable if regional

Japan can’t afford to be outbid on LNG: Kikkawa
(Nikkei Business, April 14)
•  This is an interview with Kikkawa Takeo, Vice Chancellor of the International University of Japan
and a commentator on energy issues.
•  Kikkawa says Japan has traditionally been favored by LNG suppliers, since it pays a premium on
LNG spot contracts.
•  However, LNG producers are well aware that Japan’s latest basic energy plan didn’t mention LNG,

and are less inclined to guarantee contracts to Japanese buyers.
•  While the government did not explicitly mention the importance of LNG in its latest energy plan,
LNG has absorbed the disparity between reality and the government’s targets for renewable- and
nuclear-generated electricity.
•  Japan must remain invested in the Sakhalin 1 project to ensure it doesn’t run out of gas. While
Exxon said it will pull out of Sakhalin 1, this has yet to happen.
•  The situation around Sakhalin 2 most affects Hiroshima Gas, which will be exposed to the volatile

spot market if forced to pull out of its long-term purchase agreements.
•  Regarding nuclear energy, Kikkawa notes that units six and seven of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
nuclear power station are both advanced boiling water reactors, and hold the potential to greatly
relieve Japan’s energy crisis.
•  But the community won’t support the restarts as long as TEPCO is in charge.
•  If Kashiwazaki-Kariwa restarts, then it needs to be taken over by Tohoku Electric or the Japan

Friend or Foe?
How Competition Authorities in Japan View the Energy Transition

One difficulty of an energy transition is that incumbent market players enjoy outsized
influence thanks to decades of growth and consolidation. The move to a low-carbon
economy promises profound structural changes in the industrial, social and financial
sectors. But, how to make sure this process does not unduly favor the existing players,
thus replicating their domination in the clean energy sector?

This is the question Japanese antitrust authorities are starting to grapple with as the
energy transition accelerates. Supporting any and all innovation that will help Japan
reach carbon neutrality is seen as imperative. Yet allowing today’s top players to
benefit the most simply due to their extensive resources would put into question the
oft-stated goal of making the energy transition inclusive and fair.

The issue is especially pertinent in Japan, where energy corporations look to
repurpose legacy fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil terminals and thermal power
plants, for hydrogen, ammonia and other constituents of a low-carbon economy. If
Japan follows its gradual trajectory towards green energy, will it also mean that new
players will be largely shut out from the transition? Or, will owners of existing fossil
fuel infrastructure be made to compete on a level playing field?

Japan NRG Weekly sat down with former Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC)
officials to discuss the developments in the oil and gas, hydrogen, and power sectors.


More consolidation in the oil sector?
In 1980, Japan had 17 oil refineries, but eventually they were consolidated inside
three groups: ENEOS, Idemitsu and Cosmo Energy. The era of M&A within the sector
looked over until this month. Earlier in April, an activist investment fund led by former
state bureaucrat Murakami Yoshiaki acquired an 8.28% stake in Cosmo Energy,
spurring talks of further industry consolidation.

METI’s most recent long-term oil demand forecast shows that industry is moving away
from fossil fuels at a faster rate than expected, creating redundant refining capacity.
The national fuel oil demand forecast is for a decrease of 7.1% by 2026 over 2021
levels, dropping to 142 million kiloliters. The previous five-year forecast was for a 5.7%
demand decline by 2025 versus 2021.

The new forecast equals 2.4 million barrels/ day; yet, Japan’s refining capacity is 3.5
million barrels/ day. This means, within five years 1/3 of the nation’s refining capacity
will be redundant; and by 2030, unused capacity will increase to more than half.

The 3.5 million barrels/ day breaks down as follows: 50% for ENEOS; 27% for
Idemitsu; and 11% for Cosmo Energy. The remaining 12% is claimed by small local
refineries – Fuji Oil, Taiyo Oil, and Seibu Oil.

The possibility of small independent refineries joining one of the bigger three would
have negligible competition impact. Meanwhile, thoughts of a merger among any of

18


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

the top three or even all three joining to form a single oil company, simply won’t be
possible, experts say.

The JFTC, upon reviewing the merger plans of JX with Tonen General (to form today’s
ENEOS) and Idemitsu with Showa Shell in 2016, warned that a decrease in the
number of players will restrain oil market competition and harm consumers. The
refineries are already in a commoditized market where differentiation is not easy.

In the end, the JFTC cleared the mergers mentioned above, but not unconditionally.
The refineries had to commit to programs that foster competition. For example, in a
bid to create alternative supply flows, they have to support outside traders and
distributors when it comes to importing and stockpiling oil products.


Antitrust views on the hydrogen supply chain
Antitrust authority decisions are deeply impacted by how markets, potential
substitutes and competition pressures are defined.

Five years from now, the emergence of renewable alternatives to gasoline and other
oil products will likely revamp the market structures. Among the changes will be
multiple hydrogen and ammonia co-firing pilot projects. Also, the first offshore wind
projects are expected to begin operations in 2028.

This increase in the availability of substitutes to fossil fuels will impact JFTC decisions.

As co-firing generation takes off, import of hydrogen and ammonia is expected to
pick up from 2028. Hydrogen from Australia and the Middle East will provide
competition for locally sourced supply, and also to fossil fuel energy. Players like
Iwatani Corp, the largest Japanese hydrogen producer, will do both – manufacture
domestically and import from Australia, bolstering the number of supply options on
the market.

ENEOS, Idemitsu and Cosmo plan to convert their oil desulfurization and processing
units, tanks and terminals into hydrogen/ammonia supply bases, and their oil and
chemical tankers into carriers of liquefied hydrogen. A dehydrogenation unit and an
oil desulfurization unit could run side-by-side in a single refinery.

The refineries, however, aren’t evenly spread across the country. Rather, they’re
concentrated in industrial zones such as the Tokyo, Sakai and the Yokkaichi bay areas.
The islands of Kyushu and Hokkaido each have one refinery, run by ENEOS and
Idemitsu, respectively.

So, this raises the question: If ENEOS, which doesn’t have a refinery in Hokkaido,
reaches out to Idemitsu to use its facility to supply green hydrogen from Australia, will
this cause competition issues? And will the move restrain other players from supplying
hydrogen/ammonia to Hokkaido? How about Cosmo, which partners with the biggest
Japanese hydrogen producer Iwatani – will it be able to join such initiatives?

A former JFTC official says it’s possible that refineries could be allowed to share
facilities. The main concern, however, is that the alliance must be rigidly defined.
Outside those alliances, the refineries and traders must continue to compete.

Antitrust authorities will need to see how the market develops before they can define
what may constitute anti-competitive behavior. After all, being an oil refinery does not
mean it will automatically take a major position in the hydrogen supply market, notes
attorney Matsuda Serina.

Based on company disclosures, for example, it appears Iwatani is taking the lead in
terms of hydrogen volumes, while ENEOS has the most diversified project pipeline.
Meanwhile, the technologies to produce, store and transport hydrogen are still in
development and the molecule supply chain structure will likely fluctuate for a while.

In an immature market, industry players hedge strategies. ENEOS is developing a
proprietary Direct Methylcyclohexane (MCH) hydrogen transport process, but it’s also
collaborating with Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Iwatani on supply chains based on
transporting liquid hydrogen.

Antitrust view of the co-firing sector
JERA is now a key player in ammonia-coal co-firing after last year embarking on 20%
ammonia co-firing trials and eyeing a commercial launch in 2024 in Aichi Prefecture. In
February, JERA opened an international tender for up to 500,000 tons/ year of
ammonia to be supplied from 2027 through the 2040s, thereby making the company
Japan’s largest ammonia importer and supplier. JERA also has 30% of Japan’s coal-
fired power capacity.

Rival J-Power, with a 20% coal-fired capacity share, plans to commercialize coal-
biomass-ammonia co-firing by 2026, at its Matsushima power station. It’s also
partnering with Chugairo, an ammonia burner maker, Osaka University, the Central
Research Institute of Electric Power Industry and government research institutes.

With co-firing processes at a very early stage, the industry approach in Japan is
generally based on collaboration. Over time, this may need to change.

Japanese Antimonopoly Act guidelines generally ban joint research and development
by two potential competitors as this could restrict future competition. Still, even a very
concentrated field could be expanded through the entry of startups that offer new
ammonia and related co-firing technologies. The startups themselves may become
natural targets for the utilities, but such acquisitions have a chance of going through,
provided the antitrust authorities see evidence that there are multiple entities with
breakthrough technologies, said one lawyer.

Attorney Matsuda says there are several approaches the antitrust authorities could
take to frame the market. One would be to see this as a technology development
market. Or, officials could treat the operators of power services that employ ammonia-
thermal co-firing as a separate market.

“The power generation market may not necessarily be defined as a single nationwide
market,” she said.

In March, METI launched an energy and competition expert group to identify
regulations that block the growth of a climate-resilient economy. This was a response
to calls for more flexible competition rules to help companies to work together on
carbon neutrality projects, specifically in building supply chain infrastructure for the
manufacture, transport and storage of hydrogen and ammonia.

The group will first study regulatory trends overseas in order to better align Japanese
policies with the global community, and may discuss specific issues at a later stage.


How lenient will the officials be?
In the past, a number of industries have asked authorities to be more lenient on
competition rules in the face of structural challenges.

In November 2020, the regional bus transport and bank sectors were exempted from
the Antimonopoly Act strictures, allowing flexible mergers and joint operations for a
period of 10 years. Those sectors are essential for regional economies, many of which
are facing a declining population.

So far, this is the only standout, despite regular lobbying for relaxed antimonopoly
rules from several other industries. What would make a more lenient approach for the
energy transition even more unusual is the fact that clean energy is a growing industry
with bright prospects.

The questions that Japan’s antitrust authorities now face include: How will industrial
growth policy and market competition policy interplay? And, if greater leniency is
provided to players involved in decarbonization, how long should this last and what is
the basis to end this approach?

The debates in government and business circles are just beginning, but they are
certain to last months and years, and are sure to be closely followed – especially by
new entrants in the power and energy markets. Renewable operators claim the
unbundling of regional power monopolies was superficial, leaving legacy players with
undue advantages in the liberalized electricity market. Will the same be true in the
age of hydrogen and gigawatt-scale renewables?

Ocean Energy Shows Progress
As Projects Start to Move to the `Megawatt’ Stage


Japan could generate nearly 170 TWh of electricity, or 20% of its annual needs, in the
open seas through energy sources other than offshore wind power generation,
according to government-backed research suggesting the nation can do more to
harness marine energy.

After decades of theoretical analysis, close monitoring of water systems, R&D projects
at home and abroad, Japanese marine energy tech is now maturing into sizable
demonstration facilities, with a few aiming to reach commercial scale in the next two-
three years.

National strategy sees the application of generation systems that rely on ocean
currents, tides and sea waves as naturally suited for smaller, remote parts of the Japan
archipelago, which boasts over 6,000 islands.

The strong push to develop offshore wind in Japan, however, could also bring ocean
energy into the mainstream as developers look at ways to maximize the effectiveness
of their sea areas through hybrid, multi-technology arrays.


Background
Ocean energy is a renewable power source that’s seen little development despite
decades of research. There’s only 517 MW of installed capacity globally among the 22
countries that form the International Energy Agency’s Ocean Energy Systems program
(IEA-OES). Most of that capacity is from two tidal range dams: one in France and the
other in South Korea.

Japan was one of the earliest members of IEA-OES, joining in 2002, but it doesn’t
even provide regular updates for the group’s annual report, unlike other members
that include the U.S., China, India, Denmark, the UK, and Singapore.

In part, this may be because after an initial wave of enthusiasm in marine energy
following the 2011 Fukushima accident, progress stalled as more mature technologies
such as solar and wind power caught the popular imagination. When Japan’s first
Green Growth Strategy was announced in late 2020, ocean energy wasn’t even
mentioned.

Since then, technical progress and innovation has revived business attention. In
FY2018, state-backed research hub NEDO launched a three-year, grant funding
program to accelerate R&D and set ocean energy on course to roll out commercially
viable technologies by 2030. The program was succeeded by targeted funding for
both startups and large companies.

A similar approach was taken by the Ministry of Environment (MoE), which secured
funding for a 500-kW tidal current power generation project off the Goto Islands,
Nagasaki Prefecture. The one-year project, started in 2021 and led by a unit of Kyushu

Electric, involved installing, operating and decommissioning a tidal turbine shipped
from the U.K.

Incidentally, the Goto area is also the site of Japan’s first commercial-scale floating
offshore wind turbines tender awarded to a group of eight domestic companies. The
group aims to deliver 16.8 MW of capacity, more than the size of current ocean
energy projects, but considerably less than the established fixed-bottom offshore
wind turbine technology.

As ocean energy projects gain in size and deliver positive results over long-term
demonstrations in open seas, the sector could be in line to switch from the current
grant-based model to tariff-based revenue support, much like the way solar, wind and
biomass energy developed with the introduction of the Feed-In Tariff (FIT).


Main types of ocean energy pursued in Japan
Japan has spent decades surveying its waters. Data on wave, tide and seawater
temperature patterns span at least two or three decades, and much of it can be
accessed on government websites. Japan’s Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, last updated
in 2018, focuses on ocean energy for remote islands, where electricity costs are high
and supply options limited.

Annual Electricity
Marine Power Type           How It Works
Potential in Japan
Ocean Current    Strong ocean current in the open sea rotates turbine 10 - 37 TWh



Tidal flow in a strait, or similar water channel, turns
Tidal Current                                         6 TWh
turbine rotors
Wave             Vertical motion of the wave pushes the rotor 19 - 87 TWh



Harness the difference in temperatures at the sea
surface and in deep water, for example, by employing
Ocean Thermal    a device with liquid ammonia: the boiling point of the
(Temperature Difference) gas is raised by adjusting pressure; warm seawater is 15 - 47 TWh
Energy           used to cause evaporation of the ammonia that turns
the turbine; the steam is then cooled using cold
seawater

|  | demonstrations in open seas, the sector could be in line to switch from the current |  |  |
|  | grant-based model to tariff-based revenue support, much like the way solar, wind and |  |  |
|  | biomass energy developed with the introduction of the Feed-In Tariff (FIT). |  |  |

|  | Main types of ocean energy pursued in Japan |  |  |
|  | Japan has spent decades surveying its waters. Data on wave, tide and seawater |  |  |
|  | temperature patterns span at least two or three decades, and much of it can be |  |  |
|  | accessed on government websites. Japan’s Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, last updated |  |  |
|  | in 2018, focuses on ocean energy for remote islands, where electricity costs are high |  |  |
|  | and supply options limited. |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| Marine Power Type |  | How It Works | Annual Electricity
Potential in Japan |
| Ocean Current |  | Strong ocean current in the open sea rotates turbine | 10 - 37 TWh |
| Tidal Current |  | Tidal flow in a strait, or similar water channel, turns
turbine rotors | 6 TWh |
| Wave |  | Vertical motion of the wave pushes the rotor | 19 - 87 TWh |
| Ocean Thermal
(Temperature Difference)
Energy |  | Harness the difference in temperatures at the sea
surface and in deep water, for example, by employing
a device with liquid ammonia: the boiling point of the
gas is raised by adjusting pressure; warm seawater is
used to cause evaporation of the ammonia that turns
the turbine; the steam is then cooled using cold
seawater | 15 - 47 TWh |

We review several standout projects close to commercial use.


1. The startup Global Energy Harvest Co. (formerly SoundPower) is building a
circulation-type wave power pumped storage. Toyo Denki said late last year that it
received an order for a 300-kW system from the company, and that it’ll work with
Austria’s Andritz Group on the project. Andritz has equipped some of the world’s
biggest tidal power facilities.

The system designed by Global Energy Harvest is said to be unique. It doesn’t directly
use the energy from waves, but instead funnels the water into a pump which then
releases it, and with that motion drives the generator. It’s similar to how hydropower-
pumped storage systems release water from an elevated dam.

Combining pumping action with wave power avoids the need for multiple rotors that
could interfere with sea life. It also makes the system more durable, and can even hold
up in a typhoon, says Global Energy Harvest, which wants to launch a 332-kW
circulation-type wave power pumped storage generation system by next year. The
facility may be located in Kumejima Island, Okinawa Prefecture.

Global Energy Harvest believes its hybrid system could achieve a power generation
cost of ¥20/ kWh, which would make it competitive with offshore wind projects. It’s
also enough to recoup the invested money within four years, less than half the time
for a solar project. Other advantages are that it can be installed near existing
infrastructure, and it doesn’t require much maintenance, unlike most marine energy
systems.

In the last two years, Global Energy Harvest has raised close to ¥300 million from
companies including ENEOS, Daiwa House, Edge Labs, and Japan Green Power
Development Co. The startup is also one of the recipients of NEDO ocean energy
program funding.

2. Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL), a shipping firm, will launch a large facility with ocean
thermal energy conversion tech by around 2025. The 1 MW station will cost several
billion yen. Before that, the company will conduct demonstrations in Okinawa
Prefecture.

The shipping firm plans to use existing pipes built for fishing to lower the cost of
creating a new ocean energy facility, which the company hopes will allow it to cut the
cost to ¥20/ kWh by mid-decade. If the plans materialize, Mitsui OSK sees the
potential to install more ocean energy plants in both Japan and abroad, such as in
Indonesia.

The shipping firm also invested earlier this year in Bombora Wave Power, an
Australian firm operating in the UK, which seeks to commercialize wave energy with a
1.5 MW validation project during 2022.

Aside from MOL, ocean thermal energy conversion systems are researched by the
team at Saga University, which hopes to combine the electricity generation aspect of
the technology with capability to desalinate seawater. The university will participate in
an experiment of the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) system in Malaysia
around 2024.


3. NEDO’s initial three-year ocean energy project helped IHI hold a demo experiment
of the world’s first floating type ocean current turbine called the Kairyu. The 100-kW
turbine was lowered 50 m below sea level off the coast of Kuchinoshima Island in the
path of the Kuroshio Current. The project did generate electricity, validating the
concept and collecting key data, but saw its second phase delayed by the pandemic.

Science, University of Tokyo, which was installed in front of the Hiratsuka Shinko
breakwater in Kanagawa Prefecture, and which was connected to the grid. Kawasaki
Heavy Industries was one of the firms involved in the one-year demonstration project.

The ministry also selected Kyuden Mirai, a unit of Kyushu Electric, to run a tidal
current power generation demonstration this year as part of its regional
decarbonization funding program. The project will run a 1 MW generator, reaching
the start of commercial scale.

Conclusion
Given the slow pace of technological development, in part due to the need to test
long-term impact on the ocean environment, it can be easy to disregard ocean
energy’s potential. Yet, a clear trend in renewable energy has been the stacking of
different technologies within a project to maximize the total efficiency and returns.
Ocean energy systems have the potential to do that for offshore wind power projects.

Finally, as a hallmark of how far the sector has come, one of Japan’s top insurers,
Sompo, has begun to offer comprehensive insurance policies for tidal power
generation. This apparently small detail is a strong indicator that the mechanics of
ocean energy is no longer only an academic discussion.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Argentina/ Renewable energy
Energy company Genneia will invest $200 million to build 1 GW of renewable capacity
— 222 MW of solar and 878 MW of wind energy, to be distributed in 11 parks across
the country. Over the last five years, Genneia invested $1.2 billion in renewable
capacity.

Denmark/ Coal power
Power company Ørsted will boost its coal reserves in anticipation of increased usage
of the fuel next winter. The move is a surprise because Ørsted is one of the world’s
biggest developers of offshore wind farms and seen as a champion of green energy.

Egypt/ Nuclear power
The country’s first nuclear power plant will be built at El Dabaa on the Mediterranean
Sea, in partnership with Russia’s nuclear power developer Rosatom. The 4.8 GW
facility will start operation in 2028 and has a $60 billion total price tag.

Energy Transition
In 2022, global energy investment will reach a record $2.1 trillion, a level not seen
since 2014, said Rystad Energy. Upstream oil and gas spending will grow 16%, or
$142 billion; global green capacity will grow by 250 GW as spending rises 24%, or
$125 billion. In 2021, renewables accounted for 38% of total global power, making up
a record 81% of new global capacity, according to the International Renewable
Energy Agency.

Germany/ Nuclear power
Energy company Eon won’t extend the life of its nuclear power plant, one of the
country’s three remaining nuclear sites. “There’s no future for nuclear in Germany,”
said CEO Leo Birnbaum. “It’s too emotional.” Eon’s Isar 2 plant will go offline at the
end of 2022.

Italy and Algeria/ Natural gas
PM Mario Draghi visits Algeria next week to sign a gas deal. Algeria is Italy’s second-
largest supplier, providing 21 billion c/m — 31% of annual gas consumption. The
Trans-Mediterranean pipeline that links the countries is operating only at 66% of its
annual capacity of 33 billion c/m.

India/ Renewable energy
Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate, International Holding Company (IHC), will invest $2
billion in green energy companies belonging to India’s Adani Group, which has
diversified from ports and coal-fired power plants into renewable energy.

Oil
The International Energy Agency says the global oil market won’t have a major deficit
this year because emergency stock releases and slower Chinese demand will offset
lower Russian production. The world fuel consumption forecast is 99.4 million bpd, as
opposed to the previous forecast of 99.7 million bpd before the war began in Ukraine.

South Korea/ Nuclear power
The new government will reverse an earlier plan to phaseout nuclear power. South
Korea is one of the world’s top-five fossil fuels importers, but also the fifth-largest
nuclear power producer. Nuclear accounted for 26% of its total electricity generation.
South Korea has the world’s highest density of nuclear reactors, with most of its 24
reactors located at two complexes.

UK/ Electricity markets
Contracts worth over £1.5 billion were awarded for the NeuConnect project, which is
an interconnector project linking Germany and the U.K. The project includes 725 km
of subsea cables that will enable 1.4 GW of electricity to pass in both directions
between the two countries.

U.S./ LNG
Excelerate Energy, which operates a fleet of floating natural gas import terminals
around the world, raised $384 million in an IPO, valuing the Texas-based LNG
company at about $2.5 billion. The deal was the first oil and gas IPO in more than a
year.
