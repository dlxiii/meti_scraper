150-member public-private “perovskite council” set up

(Government statement, May 21)
•  150 companies and government organizations have joined the newly established Public-Private
Sector Council to Expand Deployment and Strengthen Competitiveness of Next-Gen Solar Cells”.
The goal is to promote perovskite solar cell (PSC) technologies.
•  The Council seeks to foster large investments, to set up mass manufacturing, to build production
plants, and to stimulate demand.
•  Council members include scholars who serve on multiple METI advisory panels, manufacturers

planning PSC productions, potential users, relevant industry associations, ministries and
municipalities. Potential raw material suppliers, such as INPEX and Fujifilm, are not included.

Sectors   Members                     Notes

•  CONTEXT: The PSC modules for power plants are large-sized and more difficult to produce
compared to smaller ones for IoT devices. The Council focuses on larger installations, and so it
doesn’t include Ricoh that’s developing PSC for lighting and IoT devices. The Council will set 2040
targets for PSC power generation volume and costs. The current cost target is to reach ¥14/ kWh,
or less, in 2030.

• TAKEAWAY: Almost every govt unit is participating in this effort, which is unprecedented for any part of
Japan’s energy sector. If it works, this model of cooperation could be utilized with other new energy solutions.
Within just three-four years, PSC has gone from a niche R&D technology to one of the main decarbonization
tools touted by the govt.

Panasonic plans to more than double domestic production of EV batteries by 2030
(Nikkei, May 20)
•  Panasonic plans to more than double domestic production of EV batteries by 2030, up from the
current 12 GWh per year.
•  The firm seeks to supply potential customers like Mazda and Subaru.

•  CEO Kusumi said the firm plans to modify some domestic production lines for more advanced
batteries.
•  He added that Panasonic has faced a significant drop in demand for batteries used in car specific
models, prompting the firm to slash output from its EV battery factory in Japan; this is mainly due
to slowing demand from its key customer, Tesla.
•  CONTEXT: Panasonic has been working to boost the energy density of its 2170 cell, which could

help reduce an EV’s overall cost. It is also developing another battery that’s thicker and more
voluminous, called the 4680 cell. Panasonic is Japan's top battery maker and a major supplier for
Subaru, Mazda and Tesla. Panasonic has vowed to expand production in North America, aiming to
one day provide 200 GWh of energy in EV batteries. Its current capacity in the U.S. is around 38
GWh, but EV sales in the U.S. are slowing.




Japan-Saudi leaders talk online about crude output, hydrogen and critical minerals
(Government statement, May 21)
•  Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman postponed his visit to Japan and instead held
an online meeting with PM Kishida on May 21.
•  Kishida urged Saudi Arabia to raise crude oil output, and called for deeper cooperation in

hydrogen and ammonia global supply chains, and mineral resource development using Japanese
technologies.
•  The Prince said Saudi Arabia remains committed to stable crude supplies and would like to
enhance cooperation in clean energy and other areas.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Marubeni, Saudi Power Procurement Co sign PPA

(Government statement, May 22)
o  Marubeni Corp inked a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Saudi’s largest wind power
project run by SPPC.
o  This is the first deal involving a Japanese company in the Saudi wind sector.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan sees Saudi Arabia as potentially a strong partner in developing new sources of critical raw
materials unconnected to China, which has come to dominate the processing of these key elements. Saudi
Arabia and several countries in Africa are potential locations for this collaboration in critical raw materials.





JERA unveils renewables detection tech to minimize greenwashing
(Nikkei, May 22)
•  JERA is launching a service that detects, on an hourly basis, whether the electricity used by a
company was derived from renewable sources.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The tech will enable businesses to generate more accurate data than existing methods that only
give rough estimates of CO2 emissions based on monthly or annual calculations. Hence, it could
help prevent and eventually eliminate greenwashing.
•  The system will help companies disclose electricity usage to external parties and store that history
on a secure blockchain.
•  Since the system will accord with international standards, it could be used globally.

•  JERA is considering offering the system to electricity utilities to establish a national power
management framework.
•  CONTEXT: Electricity used at night often comes from fossil fuel sources, boosting CO2 emissions
by up to double from daytime levels. This means that firms using electricity at night might emit
more CO2 than they currently estimate. Energy derived from fossil fuel sources accounted for over
70% of Japan's power source mix in 2022, with renewable energy providing more than 20%.

Similar systems have been developed and are already in use outside of Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan lags behind regarding plans to monitor CO2 emissions; systems similar to JERA’s new tech
were developed and are already in use in other countries. Discussions on greenwashing also began much later
in Japan than in other parts of the world. Japan has no penalties for false claims. To tighten the crackdown on
greenwashing, Japan may need stricter rules that require firms to show proof to support their claims.




Minister Takaichi participates in nuclear fusion meeting in Tokyo

(Nikkei, May 21)
•  Minister of State for Economic Security Takaichi Sanae attended a meeting to promote nuclear
fusion that was organized by the Japan Fusion Energy Industrial Council (J-Fusion).
•  She emphasized the importance of nuclear fusion for Japan’s energy security and industries, saying
that a stable power supply is needed to meet demand from the country’s growing number of data
centers.
•  CONTEXT: The J-Fusion council comprises around 50 companies from various sectors. It aims to

accelerate plans to realize nuclear fusion power in Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: In 2022, Minister Takaichi announced that the govt intended to create a roadmap for nuclear
fusion energy. A draft was then published in April 2023. As allied G7 nations forge ahead with fusion energy
programs, Japan’s effort is in need of funding both from the private and public sectors.




METI publishes preliminary DAC definitions
(Government statement, May 17)
•  METI published preliminary definitions of direct air capture (DAC) and its carbon accounting

methodologies. An expert panel will put together a social implementation roadmap by late June.
•  METI specified that DAC is the act of removing carbon from air outdoors and indoors; this is in
contrast to Swiss-based carbon removal company Climeworks, which says that DAC only relates to
outdoor air capture.
•  METI will refine DAC methodology, aiming to make it applicable to earn J-Credits and other
carbon offset credits.

Sumitomo joins project to build CO2 underground storage in Canada
(Nikkei, May 23)
•  Sumitomo Corp will join a project to build an underground CO2 storage facility in Canada. When
launched in 2026, each year it will store nearly 3 million tons of CO2. That figure could eventually

expand to 10 million tons/ year.
•  Sumitomo will work with the local developer, Reconciliation Energy Transition Inc (RETI), to build
the hub, including a compression facility and pipelines
•  The companies are considering using the captured CO2 to produce SAF.
•  CONTEXT: The project, which will be located near Calgary, will be one of the world's biggest hubs
for capturing and storing CO2 when completed. It will likely store carbon from a nearby natural gas

power plant, as well as others in the area. Marubeni is also participating in a carbon capture
project in the vicinity of Calgary.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Mizuho Financial Group to provide assistance to shut down coal plants in SE Asia

(Nikkei Asia, May 21)
•  Starting July, Mizuho Financial Group (MFG) will offer funding to coal plant operators to repay
loans or pay dividends early, helping with the shutdown of these plants.
•  The funding will be limited to operators transitioning to low-carbon energy projects.
•  CONTEXT: Coal plants in Asia have a much younger average age than the coal plants in Europe or
North America. In countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, early shutdowns can cost up to $300
million. The UN asked OECD countries to phase out coal by 2030, but other nations have a 2040

target. While 70% of OECD coal capacity will retire by 2030, only 6% outside the OECD will retire
by that year.
• TAKEAWAY: Japanese banks, including MFG, pledged to cut coal financing by 2040. MFG has already
reduced its coal sector financing from ¥300 billion in 2019 to ¥236 billion in 2022. MFG has come under
criticism from NGOs since it is ranked as the biggest private lender for new coal power plants worldwide. It
made $16.8 billion in direct loans to coal plant developers in 2017-2020. There have also been online
campaigns targeting MFG. The other major Japanese banking groups, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, have faced similar criticisms. Investments in coal power plants were focused
in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. Now MFG is trying to improve its image and decarbonization efforts.




Google signs long-term solar deals to power data centers
(Japan NRG, May 24)
•  Google inked deals with renewables providers to build dedicated solar farms for its data centers in
Japan.
•  This includes corporate PPAs with Clean Energy Connect (CEC) and Shizen Energy.

•  CEC will invest ¥10 billion through 2026 to build around 800 solar farms that will provide about 70
MW of capacity.
•  The virtual PPA signed with Shizen will provide Google with environmental attribute certificates
derived from a 20 MW AC solar project developed by Shizen.
•  The solar plant will be built on a former golf course near Google's data center in Inzai City, Chiba
Pref. Operation is expected to start in 2027.
•  Google will decarbonize its operations in Japan by using "non-fossil certificates," which will

confirm that none of the electricity is derived from fossil fuels.
•  CONTEXT: By 2030, Google wants 100% of electricity consumed at its data centers and offices to
be sourced from renewables. While renewables account for about 90% of Google's power
consumption in some U.S. states, in Japan that figure is 16%. Google is expected to also set up
data centers in Hiroshima and Wakayama Prefs.
•  CONTEXT: Google isn’t the only tech giant pursuing PPAs in Japan. Amazon cooperates with

trading house Mitsubishi, CEC and other firms to supply solar energy to its Japanese data centers

(Company statement, May 20)
•  UAE state-owned Mubadala invested in Hong-Kong-based PAG's Asia Pacific renewable energy
platform that mainly focuses on supplying solar power to companies across Japan.
•  The platform – PAG REN I – aims to operate across developed economies in APAC. The fund will
invest in renewable energy assets in Asia, with solar generation in Japan a priority.
•  The platform will use Japan's corporate PPA framework to help businesses purchase electricity

directly from renewables suppliers on a long-term basis.
•  CONTEXT: While the investment size has not been disclosed, PAG says it raised $500 million from
investors including Mubadala, which seeks to help Japan meet its ambitious target to install 108
GW of solar capacity by 2030.




OCCTO  releases upbeat update on power reserve margins forecasts for the summer
(Denki Shimbun, May 22)
•  OCCTO released a draft electricity supply and demand verification report that includes forecasts
for summer supply and demand (July to Sept).
•  The report forecasts that the minimum required reserve ratio of over 3% can be secured in all areas

by factoring in the supply capacity of power sources that can be activated on command (i.e.
dispatchable) and flexible power supply. This calculation also assumes weather similar to the
hottest year in the past 10 years.
•  During July and August, the reserve ratio will be in the 4% range in some areas based on measures
to secure available capacity through the capacity market framework and other means.
•  CONTEXT: The latest forecast is an update on the one presented on March 16. It takes into
account the fact that several thermal plants such as the Kawasaki Station 1 Unit 1 (LNG, 490 MW)

and Joetsu Station 2 Unit 2 (LNG, 585 MW) are not yet available due to repairs.



Orix launches virtual PPA under FIP as more firms switch from FIT

(Company statement, May 24)
•  Orix is set to use the Feed-in Premium (FIP) program to launch a virtual PPA initiative for the
trading of environmental value in renewables.
•  This initiative will launch using a solar power system on the rooftop of a logistics facility in Atsugi
(Kanagawa Pref) completed in April, and owned by Orix Group.
•  The environmental value of excess electricity generated will be sold to offices and facilities owned
and managed by Orix Real Estate.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The initiative is linked to Orix’s efforts to promote corporate PPAs in which it borrows
the land or roof of an electricity consumer, installs power generation systems there, and supplies
the electricity generated to the consumer.
• TAKEAWAY: Since developers can use FIPs to reduce the cost of corporate PPAs, we can expect an increase in
firms seeking to enter such contracts to benefit from the FIP system, which attributes the environmental value

to power producers.




BESS connection applications rapidly expand, reaching 27 GW
(Denki Shimbun, May 24)
•  With the expansion of renewable energy, applications for connection to BESS (Battery Energy
Storage System) are growing.
•  According to ANRE, the total capacity in nine areas nationwide reached 27 GW by late 2023,
almost tripling YoY. Particularly notable was Hokkaido, Tokyo, and Kyushu, all of which exceeded 5

GW in applications.
•  As the number of balancing power suppliers rises, more companies are starting to commercialize
BESS.
•  Not all connections considered will lead to actual contracts or grid connections. But out of a total
of 27 GW of applications in nine areas nationwide, (excluding Okinawa), Tokyo has the most with
capacity total of 5.35 GW, followed by Hokkaido with 5.24 GW, Kyushu with 5 GW, and Tohoku
with 4.6 GW.

•  Of the total applications, 2.93 GW of capacity has progressed to the more secure step of applying
for a connection contract. It takes about two years from contract to installation.
•  CONTEXT: BESS has been rapidly introduced in the past two years because the increase in
variable renewable energy has made dealing with surplus electricity an urgent issue; the capacity
and balancing markets have begun full-scale operation, and the applications for electricity storage
are expanding.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

ANRE considers new contract form for BESS and pumped storage hydropower
(Denki Shimbun, May 23)
o  ANRE held a meeting with experts to explore ways to improve the utilization of pumped
hydro and BESS (Battery Energy Storage System), and to ensure that these facilities are
able to operate in a more flexible and reliable manner to cover the nation’s growing
reliance on variable renewable energy sources.

o  Currently, there are issues including failed pumped storage bids in the Balancing Market,
operated by EPRX.
o  In response, the energy agency will look at new contract forms or compensation schemes
for operators of pumped hydro and BESS, which would be options alongside revenue
from balancing and ancillary services markets.
o  Additionally, the agency presented a policy to make the Intraday Market operate under a

system similar to the balancing and ancillary services platforms. The changes may
introduce new bidding processes for both contracted and non-contracted power sources,
ensuring that additional power can be sourced as needed.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
Ammonia or Methanol: Which is the Winning Zero-Emission Ship Fuel?

Decarbonizing the maritime transport sector counts as one of the most important
tasks in the energy transition. Each year, global shipping leaves an emissions trail
greater than that of the world’s passenger car fleet. To green this sector, the maritime
industry is seeking the most effective and viable solutions.

In FY2022, Japan’s CO2 emissions from the shipping sector were 10.1 million tons,
which excludes oceangoing vessels that are not included in the national greenhouse
gas inventory. Oceangoing shipping accounts for about 2% of total global emissions.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a goal to cut emissions by 40%
in 2030 from 2008 levels. According to ClassNK, in order for Japan to meet this
target, a quarter of its shipping fuel needs to avoid creating a CO2 footprint; and, the
country needs new ‘zero emission' ships.

Among the various clean energy solutions considered, the main one focuses on which
fuel should replace the heavy marine fuel oil currently used by vessels. Candidates
include ammonia and methanol, but there’s also talk of shifting to synthetic methane
and bio-derived fuel options.


Among fuel alternatives, the degree of carbon reductions differ, as does the speed at
which they can be introduced to the market. This analysis assesses the readiness of
new shipping fuel candidates in the regulatory, ship development and supply
aspects.

Agreements in place, but logistics are not
In the past six-months, Japan’s shipping sector has moved to accelerate the shift to
ammonia and methanol from fossil fuels. In December last year, the city of Yokohama
and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with
global shipping firm Maersk to explore green methanol bunkering in the port of
Yokohama.

In April, the world’s second largest methanol-fueled container vessel, owned by
Maersk, made a port call. In June, NYK Lines will begin operation of the world’s first
ammonia-fueled tugboat in the Tokyo Bay area, which includes Yokohama.

Japan has 932 ports, and any ship fueled by ammonia or methanol is able to enter any
port, and offload and load cargoes. While port authorities have no right to block the
entry of such ship entries, they won’t be able to re-fuel. Presently, most ports only
have the capacity to supply marine residual fuel. About 4 million kiloliters/ year (25
million barrels) of marine residual fuel is used for ships in Japan.

Japan has no facility to serve other fuels, including LNG, and there are only two
vessels for LNG bunkering. Onshore storage facilities and bunkering vessels for
ammonia and methanol can’t be built because of a lack of clear operational and safety
rules specific to filling ammonia and methanol into ship fuel tanks.

Compared to methanol or methane, ammonia has low flammability but it’s hazardous,
causing death if direct exposure exceeds 5,500 ppm. Methanol is highly flammable,
but its health risk is much lower compared to ammonia.

5,500 ppm dosage     pains, etc.    irritation, etc.

Regulatory information gap
Relevant laws on ship refueling are the Ship Safety Act, the Act on Port Regulations
and the Act on Prevention of Marine Pollution and Maritime Disasters. In 2013, the
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) wrote LNG bunkering
guidelines to supplement those first written almost 90 years ago. The guidelines were
updated in June 2023.

Following consultation with the Japan Coast Guard, which has oversight over the Act
on Port Regulations, the MLIT is expected to write similar guidelines for ammonia and
methanol bunkering.


In 2022, ClassNK published proposed guidelines on ammonia and methanol ships
that could serve as the basis for MLIT’s guidelines. It recommended fuel tank design,
piping, ventilation, alarm systems, etc that are relevant to ship structures, but they
don’t address issues outside ship design, for example specifying mandatory reporting.

Availability of ships
Municipalities with ambitions to build ammonia supply chain networks by winning
national government subsidies are hoping for the early release of ammonia bunkering
guidelines. Some industrial stakeholders, however, believe that methanol bunkering
could be more practical. ClassNK said that since ammonia is highly toxic, all possible
risks must be considered; while other fuels won’t require intensive risk analysis.

As opposed to liquid ammonia that’s stored at -33 C, methanol is stored at room
temperature. Present facilities for fuel oil storage and delivery could be used for
methanol, which greatly reduces costs. Another methanol advantage is that merchant
fleets are already using the fuel for commercial operations.

NYK Bulkship owns three dual-fuel ships that will operate on marine residual fuel oil
and methanol. Although small, there is demand that’s poised to grow as orders for
dual-fuel ships continue to rise.

Meanwhile, developments on the ammonia front are also making progress. In June,
Sakigake, the world’s first ship fueled by ammonia will make its first sail in Tokyo Bay.
Sakigake is a tug boat owned by NYK Lines with a gross tonnage of 272 tons.

It was originally an LNG-fueled vessel, converted to ammonia specifications by IHI
Power Systems. Marine residual oil (grade-A heavy fuel oil) will ignite the engine and
then Sakigake will be fueled entirely by ammonia during its journey.

Shin Nippon Kaiyosha, a NYK group company, will operate Sakigake, with its crew of
two or three. The market, however, will have to wait until 2028 to see construction of a
fully-fledged ammonia-fueled ship that’s completed and ready to sail.

Fuel availability
Currently, over 90% of the world’s methanol production uses natural gas as feed.
While it is effective in reducing sulfuric and nitrogen oxide emissions, its carbon
footprint is only 15% lower than that of fuel oil. It would need to be replaced by
‘green’ methanol, which is either bio-based methanol or made from renewables-
derived hydrogen.


One shipbuilder told Japan NRG that the global green methanol supply chain is not
as robust as for ammonia, and that if demand outstrips supply then methanol for zero
emission maritime fuel might not be economically sustainable.

Japan has 1 million tons/ year of domestic ammonia production, and it imports all of
its methanol requirements of 1.8 million tons/ year. Each year the country will need
about 7 million tons of green methanol in order to replace the current annual
consumption of 4 million k of fuel oil.

Using CO2 and hydrogen from chemical plants, Japan’s leading methanol
manufacturer, Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, plans to produce green methanol in the
Mizushima industrial zone (Okayama Pref). The goal for annual output is 100,000 tons
by 2030.

Will the government offer the same level of support to build a global green methanol
supply chain like it is doing for ammonia and hydrogen? That will depend on
international trends, said a MLIT official.

As methanol gains traction in the global shipping industry, Japan will seek to expand
its market share there. But for the time being, the government will also continue to
support the growing penetration of ammonia, pinning hopes that either one or both
of the fuels – with Japanese technology embedded in the supply chain – will turn out
to be a game changer.

Mo’ Power, Mo’ Problems? Japan’s Chip Revolution is

Reversing Power Demand Picture
As Japanese energy planners sit down this spring to update the nation’s strategy,
there’s one key assumption they need to rethink entirely. The sixth iteration of the
Basic Energy Plan, ratified in October 2021, forecasted that electricity demand would
fall 10% this decade thanks to greater efficiency and more conservation. Few would
argue that today.

In the last two years, an ambitious state push to revive semiconductor manufacturing
in Japan has yielded fruit. The world’s biggest chip maker, Taiwan’s TSMC, opened its
first fabrication plant in Japan in late February. As if by coincidence, after 24 straight
months without electricity demand growth, March 2024 saw national power
consumption tick up. And again, in April.

Within three years, at least two more major semiconductor fabs will open in Japan.
Many more facilities that produce components, materials, and equipment for the chip
plants are also in the works. That, and the rapid rise of generative AI usage, as well as
Japan’s courting of global data centers, could see power demand for the digital
sector alone jump by a factor of 10 in a matter of a decade, according to early
estimates.


While Prime Minister Kishida’s government has fully backed the semiconductor and AI
push, there’s been much less effort to grasp how this will impact the electricity system.
Japan’s success at attracting chipmakers and data centers may even have come as a
slight surprise. Today, officials are furiously updating their industrial and energy
roadmaps. Without a quick reaction, the next surprise could be energy shortages.

Chips ahoy
A leading producer and innovator of semiconductor chips in the second half of the
20th century, Japan’s influence in the sector waned significantly in the 1990s. As a
result, many of its facilities shuttered or curtailed output.

Major players, such as Toshiba, which invented flash memory, sold chip-related assets
or exited the business. Toshiba Memory was sold in 2018 to private equity firm Bain
Capital to help its parent firm survive severe financial straits. The Bain-controlled entity
is now known as Kioxia, with Toshiba Corp remaining a minority shareholder.

The fortunes of Japan’s semiconductor manufacturers have turned around in recent
years as the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China favored a shifting of
supply chains to allied territories. As well as tempting industry-leader TSMC to open
its first ever fab in Japan, METI has engineered the creation of a new semiconductor
champion in the country – Rapidus Corp.

Rapidus has set an extremely ambitious target of catching up with leading global chip
makers in a matter of a few years. The company started construction of its first

fabrication plant in Hokkaido last year, and hopes to launch a pilot manufacturing line
in 2025. Mass production is due to follow a year or two later.

These are not the only semiconductor facilities in the works. TSMC has already
announced plans for a second factory in Kyushu, at the same location as its first, and is
mulling a third. A rival chip-maker from Taiwan, PSMC, has joined with Japanese
conglomerate SBI to build a fab in Miyagi Pref. Kioxia, the former Toshiba unit, has
two new manufacturing expansion projects. And there are at least a dozen other new
factories planned in Japan for various kinds of chips.

Of course, a semiconductor fab does not exist by itself; manufacture is reliant on at
least two dozen or so suppliers of materials, components, equipment, and post-
processing, the capacities for which also need to increase in Japan.

How much energy does a chip need?
In 2025, at the stage of a pilot manufacturing line, the Rapidus semiconductor fab in
Hokkaido will need access to about 100 MW of capacity, according to the firm’s own
estimates. Once it ramps up to mass production, full capacity needs might escalate to
600 MW. That’s more electricity generation capacity than either of the first two units
of the Tomari Nuclear Power Plant in Hokkaido, which has been offline and under
inspection by the nuclear regulator for over a decade.

What’s more, Rapidus management vowed to procure all their electricity from clean
energy sources, since their clients are likely to be major IT firms with net-zero
commitments. This allows Rapidus to procure from renewable energy sources or
nuclear. At present, Tomari NPP isn’t available. But even if its 912 MW Unit 3 is finally
allowed to restart, local power demand won’t be sated.

Near the Rapidus fab will operate various suppliers as part of a planned
semiconductor cluster. How much power they’ll require in total is still unclear, but
according to U.S. experts, every $1 billion spent on new chip manufacturing leads to
about $300 million in primary electricity purchases. That expenditure ratio doubles
with data centers, said Mark P. Mills, the executive Director of the National Center for
Energy Analytics, in recent testimony to the U.S. Senate.

In Kyushu, TSMC has not yet publicly articulated its energy demand, but its new
semiconductor plant in Arizona, U.S. will require 200 MW at the first phase and then 1
GW at full capacity, the CSIS think-tank said last month, citing filings for the local
transmission system expansion. The Taiwanese company used about 21 TWh of
electricity in 2022. That’s equivalent to about 2.4% of Japan’s national total, or 40% of
the volume generated by nuclear plants in FY2022.

Moving the needle, already?
TSMC’s first factory in Japan has operated for only a couple of months, so it’s too
early to make definitive conclusions. However, several trends are already visible,
according to data provided to Japan NRG by energy forecasting specialist, Yes
Energy.

On a national level, YoY electricity demand has been 0 or negative between March
2022 and March 2024. This is based on Yes Energy data that filters out weather
impact on power demand; the data covers all the major grids in Japan apart from
Okinawa. In March 2024, the demand was up 1.9% on a year earlier; in April, it was
0.1%.


Once we zoom into the electricity demand picture in the Kyushu region, however,
things are even more stark. Kyushu’s YoY demand growth turned positive in
September 2023. While that particular month’s consumption is ‘artificially’ inflated
because of the power outages in Sept 2022 due to Typhoon Nanmadol, the rest of fall
and winter 2023/24 shows positive weather-corrected demand growth even as
nationwide figures are negative.

The leadup to the TSMC factory opening is a possible contributing factor, according
to Mark Todoroff, business development director at Yes Energy. The demand switch
starts to be seen after the August Obon holidays and continues into 2024, apart from
two weeks in early January.

The demand uptick can be seen even more clearly when we zoom into the hourly
demand picture.

Judging by the rollout of new semiconductor facilities nationwide, similar changes are
coming to Hokkaido, Tohoku, and some parts of Kansai.

The nation’s energy planners thought this decade would be dedicated to replacing
fossil fuels in a shrinking electricity system. Now they’ll need to consider how to shift
to cleaner sources in an expanding market.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / LNG
Shell expects that its Australian supplies of LNG will help meet demand from
emerging markets in south and SE Asia. Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and
Bangladesh are expected to be key growth markets.

Australia / Nuclear power
The cost of nuclear power is six times higher than renewable energy, making it the
most expensive energy source in Australia, according to the Clean Energy Council,
adding that nuclear power stations are expensive and must run non-stop to break
even.

BESS
Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are projected to be the most competitive
power storage type because of the sharp decline in its cost due to innovation in
technology and manufacturing. BMI reported that since 2010, the average installation
costs dropped by 90%, making its price lower than pumped-hydro storage.

China / Oil and gas
Sinopec and TotalEnergies signed a strategic cooperation agreement to cover oil and
gas development, LNG value chain, refining and chemicals, engineering and trading,
and new energy.

China / Hydropower
A report by Cornell University claims that China's decarbonization plan could
negatively impact crucial river systems and farmland, especially due to hydropower
expansion in the Mekong and Salween basins. Potential problems include river
fragmentation and altered flood cycles.

LNG
Last week, Asian spot LNG prices rose to the highest levels since January; hot weather
spurred demand for the fuel. In May, Asia remained the preferred destination for U.S.
free-on-board LNG, with India, Japan, and South Korea resuming their buying.

South Korea / Hydrogen power
The country launched the world’s first auction for clean-hydrogen-fired power, for up
to 6,500 GWh of electricity produced annually over a 15-year period, starting 2028.
The 15-year contracts are for 100% H-based electricity generation (using turbines or
2
fuel cells), ammonia co-fired in coal power plants, or hydrogen co-fired at natural gas
power plants.
Taiwan / Offshore wind
Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) completed construction of the 600 MW
Changfang-Xidao offshore wind project. It comprises 62 Vestas V174 turbines.

Thailand / SMRs
Thailand’s EGAT and EDF (France) discussed collaboration on developing Small
Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. The goal is to diversify clean electricity production
options, supporting Thailand's carbon neutrality goals.

Vietnam / Renewable energy
Việt Nam Electricity reported that, to date, 29 renewable energy projects with a total
capacity of more than 1.58 GW have been supplying energy to the national power
grid.
