Hydrogen hub municipalities set FY2024 budget plans, Tokyo leads with ¥20 bln

(Government statements, Feb 6)
•  Municipalities aiming to be hydrogen hubs -- Tokyo Metropolitan govt (TMG), Yokohama City,
Kawasaki City, Fukushima Pref -- have finalized FY2024 budget plans. The local assemblies are
expected to vote before March 31.
•  TMG plans to nearly double its hydrogen budget to ¥20.3 billion from ¥11.4 billion;
o  Major items include ¥4.2 billion for subsidizing fuel cell (FC) trucks,
o  ¥2.4 billion for FC stations,
o  ¥1.1 billion for FC garbage collection vehicles.

•  Yokohama’s hydrogen hub development and FC subsidies will nearly triple to ¥98 mln from ¥35
mln.
o  Subsidies for FC stations and FC buses remain at ¥10 mln for each.
•  Kawasaki, however, plans to cut its hydrogen strategy promotion budget to ¥37.5 mln from ¥43.8
mln.
•  Fukushima plans ¥418 mln for FC station and FCV subsidies; ¥31.7 mln for hydrogen and carbon

neutral tech; and ¥41.4 mln for hydrogen talent resources.
o  YoY comparison figures were unavailable.
• TAKEAWAY: As much as the budget increases, one point of interest is in the differences between
municipalities. For example, Kumamoto Pref, which has no hydrogen hub aspirations, seeks a ¥8 mln budget
to remove a prefecture-owned FC station, and plans to slash FCV subsidies. However, it aims to expand the
“RE100 Area” renewable project budget to ¥658 mln, from the current ¥3 mln, in order to attract

semiconductor investment. The Japanese energy landscape is slowly decentralizing as municipalities develop
independent energy strategies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Tokyo Metro Govt, New South Wales ink hydrogen MoU

(Government statement, Feb 6)
o  Tokyo and New South Wales of Australia signed an MoU to collaborate on developing
projects in the energy transition, with a focus on hydrogen.
o  CONTEXT: Australia is Japan’s leading source of LNG and coal supplies, and New South
Wales accounts for over 60% of Japan's thermal coal supplies. However, both countries
are increasingly moving to clean energy projects, especially green hydrogen.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

JOGMEC, Germany’s H2Global ink clean hydrogen MoU
(Government statement, Feb 2)
o  Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) and Germany’s H2Global
signed a MoU to share information and hold seminars on regulation, technology and
supply chains for clean hydrogen.

METI Minister calls to minimize curtailment of renewable energy sources
(Minister statement, Feb 6)
•  METI Minister Saito called to "maximize the introduction of renewable energy while maintaining
stable power supply,” but he emphasized the need to "suppress curtailment levels as much as

possible” amid an expected increase in such actions.
•  To minimize curtailments, comprehensive measures based on the "Output Control Measures
Package" that were compiled in December will be implemented.
•  On the demand side, efforts will be made to facilitate introduction of storage batteries and
promote new electricity rate menus that encourage demand response (DR).
•  On the supply side, measures such as lowering the minimum output of thermal power plants and
improving interregional transmission lines will be pursued.




METI panel lists Perovskite tariff policy discussion points
(Government statement, Feb 7)
•  METI’s Power Tariff Committee listed discussion points for creating a new category in Feed-in-

Tariff and Feed-in-Premium, aiming for a launch of perovskite solar cell-based power supply service
as early as 2025.
•  By 2025, PSC power suppliers expect to achieve power generation costs of ¥20 / kWh or less. The
FIT / FIP schemes should encourage them to be self-sufficient.
•  Policy clarity on panel recycling and plant decommissioning, which align with regulations, will be
required.
•  CONTEXT: Presently, solar power is categorized by the size of solar farms and the target user

segment (residential or businesses), but not by the type of solar panel. The METI committee plans
to create a separate category for PSC power.
• TAKEAWAY: There is another consideration in terms of PSC power commercialization. The METI committee
also dismissed claims made by some developers that the amount of lead contained in PSC modules are
negligible and will have almost no environmental impact. This decision has triggered PSC developers to launch
studies on tin iodide as an alternative raw material. They are also developing technologies to recover lead

from the PSC modules as commercialization of tin-based PSC is likely to take several years.




JGC begins field studies of bolt-free Perovskite sheets
(Japan NRG, Feb 7)
•  In January, JGC Corp began field studies of plastic sheets with perovskite solar cell (PSC) modules.
The modules, which are thin and resemble film, are pasted on a resin sheet. Nuts or bolts are not
needed to stabilize the modules.
•  JGC developed the sheets and fastened them to the roof of a JGC warehouse in Tomakomai City

(Hokkaido) and on its employee dormitory in Yokohama (Kanagawa Pref). In March or April, JGC
plans to hang the sheets on building walls.
•  The sheets use reinforced woven resin that insulates heat, is lightweight and wind resistant.
EneCoat Technologies provided the modules.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The field studies will focus on module endurance and power efficiencies in different
environments. It will take several more years until the product is ready to market. One application
is their installations on end-of-life solar panels, which is spreading in China. Chinese solar farms are
using glass-mounted PSC modules.
• TAKEAWAY: This is an interesting development that could benefit more than the company involved. JGC

provides engineering services for power projects and operates solar and biomass plants of its own. But its
business model is to integrate PSC systems at customer sites and to explore the possibility of selling PSC-
generated power through purchase agreements (PPA).




RIKEN-led group improves water resistance of ultra-thin solar cells
(Organization statement, Feb 1)
•  An international research group led by RIKEN developed an organic solar device that can operate
underwater, by improving its water resistance.

•  The researchers developed a tech that strengthens the interface adhesion between the anode and
the power generation layer.
•  The solar cell retains 89% of energy conversion efficiency after immersion in water for 4 hours.
Even after 300 cycles of mechanical deformation in water, with repeated compression strain of 30%
and restoration, the cell retains 96% of its energy conversion efficiency.
•  CONTEXT: These cells are seen as a potential power source for wearable devices (as sensors) or in
textiles, due to their flexibility and lightweight nature.




Iwatani, MHI to test drive liquefied hydrogen transport trucks
(Japan NRG, Feb 8)
•  Iwatani Corp, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, gas container manufacturer Koatsu Showa Cylinder and

engineering company Musashi Koatsu Giken Co. will conduct field tests of liquefied hydrogen
transport trucks in Tokyo.
•  The trucks will be equipped with a gasifier and a hydrogen dispenser and will function as a mobile
service station. Presently, hydrogen gas is compressed in cylinders and transported on trucks.
•  MHI will design the vacuum storage to keep the liquid under -235 C.
•  CONTEXT: The Tokyo Metropolitan Govt will finance two-thirds of the study costs as a part of its

R&D Support for the New Energy Promotion program.
• TAKEAWAY: Other than liquefying, hydrogen can be carried in methylcyclohexane (MCH) chemicals or
ammonia. ENEOS is reportedly developing MCH transport on trucks and the conversion of MCH to hydrogen
at service stations.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Govt to test hydrogen-fueled cranes at Yokohama, Kobe ports
(Government statement, Feb 7)
o  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism will conduct field trials of
gantry cranes, switching to fuel cell batteries or hydrogen engines from diesel engines.
o  Trial runs are expected to start this year at Yokohama and Kobe ports.

METI to reorganize metal resource oversight structure in summer
(Nikkei, Feb 7)
•  This summer, METI plans to consolidate upstream and downstream policymaking units into one
entity, aiming to improve supply chain strategies.
•  The Mineral and Natural Resources division in ANRE, which oversees upstream mining, will move

to the Manufacturing Industries Bureau.
• TAKEAWAY: The new entity might fill in the missing link, which is the mid part in the supply chains. For
example, between lithium mining and refining, and battery component manufacturing, there are diversified
processes over which Japanese companies have limited control.




MOL and JX sign MoU to develop Australia-Japan CCS value chain

(Company statement, Feb 5)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) and JX Nippon Oil & Gas
Exploration Corp (JX) signed an MoU to collaborate on a
CCS value chain between Japan and Australia.
•  The focus is on capturing CO2 from ENEOS refineries
and nearby industries. A CO2 carrier will take it to
Australia, then inject and store it at a special site.
•  MOL will seek a suitable liquefied CO2 carrier, and

estimate transport costs. JX will focus on estimating the
CCS value chain cost.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
MHI wins FEED contract for UK’s first CO2 capture plant at a cement facility
(Company statement, Feb 6)
o  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) was chosen by Heidelberg Materials UK to provide

technology for a CO2 capture plant in the UK. This project is part of the HyNet CCUS
cluster and aims to capture CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing, and store them
in a depleted gas field.
o  MHI will use its proprietary carbon technology. Worley, a global professional services
company, is partnering with MHI on the project.
o  They plan to capture up to 800,000 tons of CO2 / year and begin operations in 2028.




Toyota Motor, Chiyoda Corp ink agreement on scalable electrolyzers
(Company statement, Feb. 5)
•  Toyota Motor and Chiyoda Corp signed a development agreement on large electrolyzers, bringing
together Toyota’s fuel cell stacks and Chiyoda’s plant construction technologies.

•  They plan to combine multiple 5 MW electrolyzers to build large capacities. The base 5 MW unit
produces 100 kg / hour hydrogen, and occupies a floor area of 2.5 by 6 meters, which is half the
space taken up by typical electrolyzers.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: The benefits of scalable module units include easier shipping, speedy construction, and lower
costs. This concept was pioneered by Thyssenkrupp Nucera, which developed a base module unit called
Scalum with a 20 MW capacity.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Obayashi Corp launches AEM electrolyzer field study
(Company statement, Feb 6)
o  Green hydrogen producer Obayashi Corp installed an anion exchange membrane (AEM)
electrolyzer at its Technology Research Institute (Tokyo) to compare its performance with

a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer.
o  PEM requires expensive precious metal. Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) tech does not
require precious metals; but, it faces hydrogen quality, safety and power consumption
challenges. The emerging AEM tech might be a cheaper alternative.
• TAKEAWAY: Obayashi Corp is one of the few companies with direct exposure to both PEM and AWE
technologies. It runs PEM electrolyzers at its Oita geothermal plant and at the Kiyose R&D facility. Obayashi
does not own AWE systems, but it has been monitoring hydrogen boilers and other equipment using

hydrogen produced by the AWE tech.

Japan’s total installed wind power capacity surpasses 5 GW, northern regions in the lead

(JWPA statement, Feb 2)
•  At the end of 2023,
Japan’s total installed
wind power (onshore
and offshore) reached
5.2 GW, with 2,626
turbines nationwide,

said the Japan Wind
Power Association.
•  In 2023 alone, Japan
built 24 wind farms
(total capacity 572
MW), but four wind
farms were

decommissioned in
the same period.
•  The new wind farm’s average size was 23.8 MW per site, compared to 29.1 MW in 2022.
•  Tohoku region, which comprises six northern prefectures, led in terms of installed capacity
connected to the grid with 2.1 GW. When ranked solely by prefecture, Hokkaido leads with 683
MW.
•  Cumulative installed capacity for offshore wind power was 153.5 MW with 39 turbines at six sites.

The offshore farm data does not include wind farms accessible from coastal areas that are
categorized as semi-offshore wind farms.
•  Vestas (including under the NEG-Micon brand) and GE (including under the brands TACKE and
Alstom) have supplied the most wind turbine capacity to Japan, with just over 1 GW each. German
suppliers Enercon and Siemens-Gamesa (including under the Bonus brand) are the next-largest
with 896 MW and 723 MW respectively.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite the great strides made by Japan in solar, which has helped the country install the world’s

third-largest solar capacity, progress in wind generation has been slow. The country does not even rank in the
top 20 worldwide for wind capacity. The govt hopes that this will change in the coming decades. It has a target
of 10 GW in wind power capacity by 2030, by which time total offshore wind power capacity alone is poised to
increase by at least 4.53 GW owing to 10 projects awarded or soon to be granted through the Round 1-3
auctions held between 2021 and 2024. Last month, the govt began soliciting bids in the Round 3 auction.
Those projects, however, are expected to start operations no sooner than in 2028.

Digitalization to boost Japan’s capacity needs by 5.37 GW within ten years: OCCTO
(Denki Shimbun, Feb 9)
•  Introduction of new data centers and semiconductor factors will require a demand boost of at least
5.37 GW in Japan before the end of FY2033, according to OCCTO estimates, based on feedback

from the country’s 10 major power transmission companies.
•  This equates to an annual growth grade of 0.6-0.7%, with particularly strong interest in new
capacity in the Hokkaido, Tokyo and Chugoku areas. Industrial demand growth by itself is
expected to average an annual 1.4% in the period, compensating for a decline in household and
commercial use, coupled with energy conservation trends.
•  This is the first time that the needs of digital centers and chip manufacturers have been factored
into local power demand assumptions, and it takes into account the boom in AI and cloud

computing. The numbers produced by OCCTO are based on facilities that are deemed to have a
certain degree of progress and which have already identified their location and construction costs.

JOGMEC  pays lenders €814 million due to Russia LNG project sanctions
(Government statement, Feb 2)
•  On Jan 30, the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) made a €814 million

payment to financial institutions on behalf of Japan Arctic LNG B.V.
•  CONTEXT: This is a Dutch entity through which JOGMEC and trading house Mitsui & Co. jointly
hold a 10% stake in the Russian Arctic LNG 2 project. The project and its operating company have
been sanctioned by the U.S.
•  JOGMEC is both an investor and the loan guarantor for Japan Arctic LNG. Once the LNG project
in Russia was made subject to economic sanctions, the loans that were made to the Japanese

entity involved in it (i.e. Japan Arctic LNG) were immediately due to be repaid.
•  JOGMEC said it received notice from the lenders for early repayment; and, as the debt guarantor
specified in the agreement deed, it executed the money transfer.
•  Japan Arctic LNG is owned 75% by JOGMEC and 25% by Mitsui. The Arctic LNG 2 project is
supposed to deliver a 19.8 mln tons / year LNG manufacturing capacity.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
U.S. sanctions disrupt Mitsui OSK Lines’ involvement in Russian LNG expansion

(Bloomberg, Feb 6)
o  Mitsui OSK Lines is facing challenges in delivering specialized ships to a new Russian
LNG facility due to U.S. sanctions.
o  The company can’t charter three ice-breaker LNG ships to the Arctic LNG 2 because of
U.S. restrictions. Selling the vessels could also be difficult due to these sanctions.
o  President Hashimoto Takeshi said that they are required to sell the vessels to Arctic 2 if

they can’t provide the service. U.S. sanctions complicate this process.
• TAKEAWAY: The U.S. has made it clear that it does not want the Arctic LNG 2 facility to become operational
as it would significantly expand Russia’s production and export capacity for the fuel. There was an expectation
that U.S. pressure would prevent the completion of construction at the site in central-northern Russia, yet
project operator Novatek has managed to bring the first phase of the facility online. While Japan, in general,
supports the U.S. approach towards Russia in the wake of the incursion into Ukraine, the energy issue is more
sensitive. The sanctions against Arctic LNG 2 do not compensate Japanese (or other non-Russian) companies

for the losses associated with their investment and deliverables for this project. What’s more, President Biden
has recently frozen the permitting of new LNG export projects in the U.S., which allies can argue were a
potential alternative to Russian LNG supply. For now, it looks like state-backed entity JOGMEC has settled the
liabilities faced by the Japanese banks. How the Japan govt will cover the losses incurred by other domestic
firms involved in Arctic LNG 2 is unclear, as is the U.S. appetite for offering some form of compensation to
allies.

ANALYSIS

BY FILIPPO PEDRETTI

What’s the future for Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP and trust in TEPCO?
It’s been a long journey, longer than the zodiac animal cycle, but the stars are finally
lining up for Tokyo Electric (TEPCO). The operator behind the Fukushima disaster is
closer than ever to bringing back online its last remaining nuclear power plant after
the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa station passed a facility inspection and the regulator lifted an
operational ban.


With anti-terrorism upgrades deemed satisfactory, at a meeting of the Nuclear
Regulation Authority (NRA) on Dec 27, all five authorized officials supported the
cancellation of the ban. This is a major step forward in the NPP’s path to a restart after
a damning review of the anti-terrorism measures in early 2021, and other failings,
made the NRA issue its first ever “red card” to the utility.

Since the announcement came when the media is less active due to the holidays, the
event went largely unnoticed. But it promises to be one of the most important for
Japan’s energy security this year, and could help TEPCO shed its troubled reputation
that has haunted the utility since the March 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP’s restart of Units 6 and 7 would be a financial boon for
TEPCO, bringing online 2.7 GW of power. This would allow the utility to cut costs by
importing less LNG and coal, and boost CO2-free power sales to customers. Equally
significant, the restart of those two units would increase the Kanto region’s supply
reserve ratio, which is lower than other parts of Japan.

The final decision for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa restart now rests with local authorities,
and whether or not it succeeds will depend in large part on whether TEPCO can
convince public opinion of the NPP’s necessity. To do this, TEPCO must continue to
show that it’s capable of adequately managing the facility. The company has taken
early steps to build local support, but faces a tough task to divert public attention
from its association with the Fukushima disaster, the impact and costs of which are not
yet fully known.

Restarting Units 6 and 7
Comprised of seven reactors that span the towns of Kashiwazaki and Kariwa in Niigata
Prefecture, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP was Japan’s and one of the world’s largest
nuclear generating station, with a total nameplate capacity of just under 8 GW. Unit 1
was commissioned in 1985, while Unit 6 and Unit 7 were commissioned in 1996 and
1997, respectively.

In July 2007, an earthquake struck only 19 kilometers from Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP,
leading to its shutdown for about 21 months. Unit 7 restarted in May 2009 after
earthquake protection upgrades, followed by units 1, 5, and 6. Units 2, 3, and 4 were
not restarted by the time of the March 2011 earthquake, which means about 40% of
the plant’s capacity has been inactive for 17 years. A nuclear reactor is initially licensed
in Japan for 40 years.

All units of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP were entirely offline following the March 2011
Fukushima earthquake, the one switching off during March 2012, but in 2017, NRA
gave approval for restarting Units 6 and 7. TEPCO began the process to obtain
approval for its construction work to upgrade safety and antiterrorism features. This
work was ongoing at least until 2020.

TEPCO now seeks to restart Units 6 and 7, each with a capacity of 1.356 GW. Both
deploy the Advanced BWR design, which is often classified as a Generation III reactor,
a step up from the BWR technology of the earlier units. ABWR reactors use a more
streamlined and efficient process that boosts capacity, cuts costs, and contains more
passive safety features.

Upon the resumption of Units 6 and 7, TEPCO anticipates annual savings of around
¥100-¥120 billion from avoided purchases of fuel for other thermal stations. Operating
these two units continuously could cut Japan’s LNG consumption by about 2.7 million
tons, or 4% of the 2023 total, according to Japan NRG calculations.

Operational ban
TEPCO’s had to navigate a litany of issues in recent years. In January 2021, problems
with the protection of nuclear material were revealed, including damage in intrusion
detection equipment and a case of unauthorized use of a plant worker’s identification
card. TEPCO also registered malfunctions in Kashiwazaki-Kariwa's equipment that is
there to prevent intrusion at 12 locations.

After classifying those issues as the highest level of risk, in April 2021 the NRA issued
a corrective action order. TEPCO was prohibited from transporting nuclear fuel. The
company responded by installing intrusion detection equipment and authentication
devices.


In May 2023, however, the NRA still wouldn’t lift the order, citing a lack of
improvements in the monitoring system and more. In the same month, TEPCO set up
a Physical Protection Monitoring Office at the plant to prevent the theft of nuclear
materials, as well as sabotage.

TEPCO also facilitated communication opportunities with subcontractor employees to
address potential problems. The NRA recognized that such moves enhance the
company's ability to respond to various on-site issues. Other upgrades followed such
as new equipment to cope with heavy snowfall.

NRA lifts the ban
On December 6, the NRA released a draft report stating that upgrades and other
improvements had indeed taken place, and the pros and cons of lifting the order were
discussed. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP was inspected and a hearing was held with
TEPCO President Kobayakawa. Finally, on December 27, the NRA lifted the ban.

Perhaps even more importantly, the NRA also confirmed TEPCO’s suitability to
operate a nuclear plant. In other words, the regulator evaluated whether TEPCO
possessed the qualifications and the ability to manage the facility. Such doubts are
unprecedented for Japan, but they reflect the severity of the problems plaguing the
station over the past several years.

Are local elections needed?
With the regulator’s signoff, there is no technical or legal reason for the plant not to
restart. However, Japan has another rule rooted in societal acquiescence. The local
city authorities and the prefectural government related to the nuclear plant must give
their approval before the facility is switched back on. This has proved a major hurdle
for some NPPs.

Here, TEPCO has some good news. The mayors of Kashiwazaki, a city of 80,000, and
Kariwa, a village with a population of around 4,500, both say that the NPP’s restart is
necessary, something they recently made clear during a meeting with the TEPCO
President.

There’s widespread consensus that the restart will help the local economy, which is
struggling with an aging population, low births, and a shrinking economy. Such
reasons were also mentioned in a petition by the Kashiwazaki Chamber of Commerce
and Industry in February, pushing for an early restart.

The prefecture's economy has also been on a downward trend, with its GDP at ¥8.88
trillion in nominal terms. The nominal growth rate has dropped by 3.5% with a real
decrease of 4.4%. Prefectural income fell by 6.7% YoY, totaling ¥6.13 trillion. Per
capita prefectural income also fell to ¥2.784 million, a decrease of 5.7% YoY.


At the prefectural level, however, things are not as simple. In September, a prefectural
committee compiled a list of safety measures for verification, especially related to
evacuation, which are needed prior to discussing the restart. Based on such
verification and NRA approval, Niigata Governor Hanazumi can move ahead with a
decision. But the governor has decided to hedge his bets.

Gov. Hanazumi was elected in 2022 and saw his victory as a sign of popular support
for his pro-nuclear stance. However, he’s now proposed holding another election to
confirm that the public trust him and his stated desire to see the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
station restart.

From a political standpoint, this could help Hanazumi extend his time in office at a
time when pro-nuclear public views are in the ascendance. But the hosting of an
election as a surrogate referendum on the nuclear station restart would set an

21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

uncomfortable precedent. Other governors or even cities could follow suit. A
regulatory decision will become beholden to political and populist action.

Nuclear industry groups are understandably skeptical about setting such a precedent,
which could hinder their medium to long term business planning.

Restoring credibility
Following a meeting with TEPCO's president on December 20, METI Minister Saito
emphasized the need for the company to restore people's trust. Scrutiny extends
beyond the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, encompassing TEPCO's overall corporate
credibility.

In a recent meeting between TEPCO and local assemblies, concerns were raised
about the potential risks of restarting reactors already shut for more than a decade.
Also, the company’s representatives were questioned over issues related to protection
from nuclear material, which wasn’t directly targeted by the review, and the insights
from the recent Noto earthquake.

More specifically, assembly members raised questions about TEPCO’s safety review
process, which failed to detect errors in counter-terrorism equipment in the first place,
and the effects of the Fukushima-related cost reduction policy on the NPP’s overall
structure.

The cost of Fukushima's accident looms over TEPCO, and the final price tag is
projected to rise to ¥23.4 trillion. TEPCO, and other power companies, will cover the
compensation costs in part through government bonds. But where those costs end is

still unclear. For example, TEPCO is still incurring new compensation claims related to
treated water release.

So far, the national government has gambled on the ability of TEPCO to regain public
trust and repay the funds associated with its semi-privatization and Fukushima-related
costs. More than twelve years on from operating a nuclear power plant, the company
needs to show that this faith was justified, or lose its social license to exist in its current
form.

New Capacity Auction Seeks Stability Via Long-Term Deals for Clean Power

In January, Japan marked a significant milestone in the country’s capacity market with
the launch of a “long-term power decarbonization auction system” that seeks to partly
sponsor construction of new clean electricity generation facilities. If successful, it will
help drive investments in clean energy and help Japan reach net-zero climate targets.

The new system’s main feature is providing a guaranteed 20-year cash flow
mechanism for power sources such as solar, onshore and offshore wind power,
hydrogen, storage batteries, nuclear, hydro, geothermal – and, temporarily, LNG.
Such a guaranteed revenue stream is precisely what energy companies need in order
to be confident to make further investments in the energy transition.

While an auction system that allows dispersing of decarbonization funds beyond
renewables might raise some eyebrows, METI is confident it will help to improve grid
stability and resilience in times of shortage, and reduce emissions. The terms of the
system ensure that any thermal power that gets funded will find a way to abate its
emissions within a certain period.

With 2030 interim decarbonization targets not far on the horizon, the government is
keen to jump-start the rollout of cleaner energy capacity while also retaining a way to
help replace or revamp Japan’s baseload thermal generators. The new auction was
launched less than a year after METI officially announced it in April 2023, indicating
the urgency of the matter.


The results of the first auction will show if any energy source is favored above others.
Preliminary conditions, however, indicate a strong readiness to support energy
storage.

Bidding process
While bids for this capacity were accepted between January 23 and 30, in fact the
auction process began earlier. METI and OCCTO had asked interested parties to carry
out pre-registration by October 2023 to determine those eligible. Results are
expected about three months after the bid registration process is completed on
February 7.

Auction participants are required to demonstrate an ability to develop and operate
the proposed project, and submit a business and financial plan. The bids themselves
must be submitted in the form of bidding “units”, which state the price per kW per
year. It should be based on anticipated fixed and maintenance costs, as well as labor
and taxes. Fixed costs encompass capital expenditure for construction, grid
connection fees, and decommissioning.

The first auction offered 4 GW of capacity via two categories: stable and variable
energy sources. “Stable” are: nuclear, geothermal, hydro, biomass, and LNG. Other
“thermal power” options in the “stable” section include power plants that will


23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

introduce fossil fuel co-firing with ammonia or hydrogen. Stable sources must provide
at least 100 MW of capacity that can be connected to the grid.

For variable power sources (solar, and onshore and offshore wind), the minimum
capacity is also at 100 MW. This capacity must not be tied to other state tariffs, such
as FIT or FIP, which would rule out most solar and wind projects, as well as a large
portion of biomass plants. Projects in Okinawa and remote islands are also not
eligible.

For pumped storage and battery storage, the capacity requirement is lower – 10 MW
or more. However, operators of battery energy storage systems (BESS) will need to
demonstrate a capability to operate continuously for more than 3 hours a day.

Curiously, the new system is open to co-firing of fossil fuels with ammonia or
hydrogen, but precludes the same when the second fuel is biomass. There are other
constraints. While METI has offered 4 GW in total, there is a cap of 1 GW on pumped
and battery storage and another 1 GW on thermal plants planning modifications to
allow for co-firing. Biomass-only capacity must also fit within the latter total.

This gives a clear indication that at least half of the capacity in the initial FY2023
auction will most likely go to LNG-fired generation. This is part of a three-year plan by
METI to allocate up to 6 GW of capacity contracts to LNG power plants – both for new
construction and units that will be modified to allow for co-firing of natural gas with
hydrogen.


The ministry has indicated that the preference seemingly given to LNG is temporary
and will be phased out after this transition period. After taking these various
restrictions into account, the government will allocate contracts based on the lowest
bid price (¥ / kW / year), evaluating each power unit separately. In this sense, the bid
price of the selected power source becomes the price at which it will get the capacity
contract: pay-as-bid.

Contracts (known as Capacity Reserve Agreements, with OCCTO as the counterparty)
will be awarded until the maximum auction capacity on offer is reached.

How this fits with existing system
The new system is officially an extension to an existing power capacity market
platform that sits at the heart of government strategy to ensure security of electricity
supply. However, as outlined above, the new auction platform has very different
features from the so-called “main capacity auction” that OCCTO introduced in 2020.

The original capacity market was born from the need to add more energy security to
an electricity sector that was still adjusting to the post-2016 full liberalization of its
retail. The changes had prompted major utilities to accelerate the closure of older,
little-used capacity as it was no longer economically feasible to maintain it.

This trend, however, was rapidly shrinking the number of power facilities that could
step in during times of emergency or unusually high power demand. Hence, officials
set up the capacity market to encourage power utilities to retain additional capacity
while covering its basic costs through guaranteed payments.

24



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The effect helped increase the degree of energy security, countering the shrinking
pool of power plants able to step in when needed. However, it was largely a holdover
measure. The contract length in the main capacity market system is for one year only
and the auction is held four years before the actual year of delivery. Since the very first
capacity auction was held in FY2020, the first payments will begin from April, the start
of fiscal 2024.

Such a short contract length provided little motivation for generators to replace or
upgrade their facilities and had no impact on soliciting interest in building new power
plants based on cleaner technologies. Thus, as a whole, the main capacity market was
not capable of aiding energy planners in terms of forecasting power supply for the
coming years and decades.

As a result, the Long-Term Power Decarbonization Auction System was born.

Winners, losers
For Japan, the new auction system could be seen as a new bet on renewable power-
derived resources – a successor and an addition to the FIT and now FIP tariff
mechanism.

Battery energy storage systems will likely become the main beneficiary of the scheme,
which under the current law can be connected to the grid as a stand-alone system.
This would not have happened without the 2022 amendments to the Electricity
Business Act, which now views discharging electricity from large-scale BESS as a form
of power generation.


Prior to the revision, the Act deemed BESS only as components of other electrical
facilities such as power stations. In fact, stand-alone battery storage systems play the
same role as power plants.

While the new scheme encourages investments in pioneering clean energy sources,
the current environment has some structural limitations. The long-term
decarbonization auction is open to many power sources, but not all. Those facilities
that won contracts in any of the previous main capacity auctions are now not eligible,
even if they commit to modifications that would reduce their carbon footprint.

The new auction is also not available for power sources that are used for self-
consumption exclusively, in effect blocking applications from industry with captive
power supply that does not also feed electricity into the grid. Those that do also
provide power to the local grid can bid for that portion only.

The new framework is still in a transitional stage, hence it allows LNG plants and those
that burn coal alongside ammonia, etc., to compete. Nuclear generation is also
allowed, but it faces its own challenges with availability – not through technology but
through the decisions of regulators and local authorities.

The construction of new nuclear plants, the restarting of retired or halted reactors, and
the extension of operating licenses for units over 30-years-old is based on NRA
approval, which can take time and is impossible to forecast.

The new market continues the work-in-progress nature of Japan’s electricity markets,
and may well be adjusted based on the results and industry reactions from the first
round of auctions. It will also need to integrate with the other electricity market
platforms set up in recent years, such as the balancing market and others.

For project developers, the benefits of this mechanism will need to be weighed with
other financing options for new capacity. GX Bonds, FIP, PPAs and more are all
options, depending on the nature of the project. It will take time to see whether the
decarbonization auction is the better route. But it’s surely an advantage to have one
more alternative.

250,000 solar panels, is owned and operated by Vena Energy, and will supply Amazon
operations.

India / Energy transition
The govt will invest $67 billion in the energy sector through 2030 to meet the
country’s growing energy demand that’s expected to double by 2045. Last week, New
Delhi said its capital expenditure for the next fiscal year will rise to $134 billion.

Indonesia / Decarbonization
The Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry signed a MoU with Italy’s Eni to accelerate
decarbonization.The deal will develop bio-feedstock for fuels, energy transition
initiatives and carbon capture projects.

Natural gas
In 2024, natural gas is expected to grow by 3% or 130 bcm, reports Rystad Energy.
Greenfield LNG project investments will slow down YoY but will “remain at a robust
level” to meet global demand.

Pakistan / Solar PPA
A 150 MW solar farm in Sukkur launched that will generate about 300 GWh of
electricity annually. Renewable energy firm Scatec ASA said the project has a 25-year
USD-indexed power purchase agreement with the country’s Central Power Purchasing
Agency.

Thailand / Cambodia
Thailand and Cambodia will discuss cooperation on developing hydrocarbon deposits
in the Gulf of Thailand in a maritime zone that both countries dispute control of. The
27,000 km2 area is estimated to hold about 11 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and oil
deposits.

UAE / Green hydrogen
The Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development and HYCAP Group signed a
MoU to develop the production, storage and transport of green hydrogen. The UAE
