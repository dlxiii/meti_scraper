Govt to extend multi-trillion-yen subsidies to mitigate hikes in electricity and gas bills
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 1)
•  The govt said it will continue to provide subsidies to mitigate higher electricity and gas bills. There
is ¥3.1 trillion left for the measures from funding secured in the supplementary budget for FY2022.
•  The subsidies were introduced in January this year to cover rising electricity and gas bills. Up until
September, ¥2.5 trillion has been spent.
•  In the last three months of this calendar year through December, the govt will likely spend about

¥500 billion on subsidies, according to its estimates.
•  CONTEXT: From January, for low-voltage electricity contracts such as those used by households,
the subsidy was ¥7/ kWh; for high-voltage contracts (for businesses) the subsidy was ¥3.5/ kWh.
For September, the subsidy level will drop to ¥3.5/ kWh for low-voltage contracts and ¥1.8 k/Wh
for high-voltage contracts.
•  September levels of power and gas subsidies will continue in October and after.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kishida to ramp up gasoline subsidies from Sept 7
(Government statement, Aug 30)
o  PM Kishida decided to ramp up gasoline subsidies so that in October, retail prices will
ease to ¥175/ liter, from the present ¥185/ liter.
o  Without subsidies gasoline prices would be ¥195/ liter.

o  The subsidy was to end in September but Kishida decided to continue it until Dec 31.



Investor activist Market Forces calls on major banks to reconsider loans to JERA
(Bloomberg, Aug 30)
•  Market Forces, an investor activist group, called on eight major banks, including Deutsche Bank
and Standard Chartered, to reconsider loans to JERA. The group is concerned that the loans could

help expand JERA’s fossil fuel business.
•  The group wants the banks to engage with JERA and push for a clear plan to achieve net-zero
emissions by 2050. Climate activists are increasingly pressuring financial institutions to influence
major polluters to accelerate decarbonization efforts.
•  JERA said it aims for carbon neutrality by 2050 and seeks new tech to reduce emissions. The
company said it didn’t receive a letter from Market Forces.
• TAKEAWAY: Activist investors in the climate space have had limited success in Japan so far with all the climate

resolutions proposed at this year’s company shareholders meetings rejected. However, targeting non-
Japanese banks may lead to some degree of cooling in financing for JERA, which has said in the past that it
wants to aim for a listing on a stock exchange.

Sendai City to tighten solar installation rules from Oct 1
(Government statement, Sept 1)
•  Sendai City (Miyagi Pref) will introduce a set of regulations for solar operators; this will be more
rigorous than those of the prefecture.

•  Miyagi Pref restricts solar panel installations in certain areas to improve resilience to landslides.
Sendai will tighten solar installation rules to further increase landslide resilience and to protect
livelihoods and natural landscapes.
•  All plans for solar units of over 20 kW will require filing to the city; for the rest of Miyagi Pref, the
threshold is 50 kW. Rooftop panels will be exempted.
•  Also, the city defined eight types of zones where solar installations will require the mayor's own

approval. Sendai will set restricted zones for natural and landscape protection.
•  The new rules take effect on Oct 1, and will expand to other renewable energy sources in the
future.
•  CONTEXT: It’s becoming more challenging for renewables to operate in Miyagi Pref. The
prefecture authority plans to introduce the country’s first renewable tax on operators tearing down
forest areas starting FY2024.
• TAKEAWAY: Join a Japan NRG webinar on Sept 14, at 5pm Tokyo time, for an in-depth report and discussion

of these developments in Miyagi. A sign-up link is available here.



Wakaya governor asks METI to amend or cancel Tokyu Fudosan wind project

(Government statement, Aug 25)
•  The Wakayama governor said that a planned 94.6 MW wind turbine site (to be operated by Tokyu
Fudosan) raises safety and ecological concerns and called for either amending or entirely
cancelling the project if it’s not improved.
•  There are multiple wind stations operating in the area. The governor said that an assessment on
“aggregate environmental impacts” is needed, pointing out that Tokyu Fudosan expanded the

project size from the initial impact assessment phase.
•  CONTEXT: Over 100 opinions and questions from the public were filed to Tokyu Fudosan; many
concerned protection of mountain hawk-eagles. METI’s wind project panel met on Aug 25 to
discuss the project, but the conclusion was not announced.
• TAKEAWAY: Strong concern from local authorities can lead to the cancellation of a project, as happened to
Sojitz Corp. in June of this year. The trading company walked away from plans to develop a 109 MW wind
farm in Hokkaido after locals objected to the impact it may have on the local flora and fauna. Should the

project in Wakayama also fall through, that will delete over 200 MW of capacity from Japan’s wind pipeline in a
matter of a few months. The bigger risk is that project developers will simply decide that pursuing lengthy
wind power developments onshore is not worth the trouble, hampering national renewables targets.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Govt solicits public feedback on new wind power promotion zones
(Government statement, Sept 1)
o  METI and MLIT are soliciting public feedback on designating the coast along Yuza Town
in Yamagata Pref and the Sea of Japan Coast of Aomori Pref as Offshore Wind Project
Promotion Zones. The feedback period closes Sept 15.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  In 2020-2021, the two areas gained the “promising zone” status, a phase preceding the
final “promotion” status. Local community stakeholders concluded that the fishery and
shipping industries won’t be impacted by the wind turbines.



Osaka Gas, ENEOS to study project to produce 60 million m3/ year e-methane
(Company statement, Aug 29)
•  Osaka Gas and ENEOS began to study a plan to set up 60 million cubic meters/ year of synthetic
methane (e-methane) production in Osaka Bay using “carbon neutral” hydrogen.
•  E-methane is made by combining hydrogen and carbon in a process called methanation, which
Osaka Gas is developing. Green hydrogen will be imported by converting the gas into

Methylcyclohexane (MCH), a technology developed by ENEOS. Carbon will be captured locally.
•  The goal is to start e-methane production in Osaka Bay by 2030, which would make it the country’s
first such facility.
•  CONTEXT: Osaka Gas and ENEOS are building a large-scale international supply chain despite
calls to limit hydrogen to local consumption because its transportation requires much energy. On
the other hand, renewable suppliers overseas are keen to export hydrogen to Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: Osaka Gas and ENEOS plan to convert hydrogen into MCH by reacting it with toluene and

separating it back into hydrogen in a process called dehydrogenation. Legacy tankers and refinery
dehydrogenation units can be used, but there are emissions released during dehydrogenation. Alternative
transport options include converting hydrogen into ammonia or liquid hydrogen. Further options for hydrogen
storage under research are the use of formic acid and magnetic refrigeration.

E-methane supply chain








•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Mitsubishi, Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas partner with Sempra on e-methane in the U.S.
(Company statement, Aug 30)
o  A consortium of Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas, and trading house Mitsubishi Corp
will partner with Sempra Infrastructure to produce e-methane near the U.S. Gulf Coast.
o  The project aims to establish the world's first large-scale production supply chain of e-
methane. Up to 130,000 tons of e-methane will be made each year and then liquefied at
the Cameron LNG terminal in Louisiana for export to Japan.

o  The project will involve the production or procurement of clean hydrogen and the
construction of facilities for e-methane manufacture.
o  CONTEXT: These companies have been working on the project since 2022 and are now
involving Sempra so as to build a global market for liquefied e-methane.
• TAKEAWAY: This initiative aligns with the MoC signed by the U.S. Department of Energy and METI that
focuses on carbon capture, utilization, storage, conversion, recycling, and CO2 removal. However, it remains

to be seen if e-methane will be recognized as a carbon-neutral fuel.

Mitsui, IHI and KEPCO to work on hydrogen and ammonia supply chains in Osaka
(Company statement, Aug 30)
•  Mitsui, Mitsui Chemicals, IHI, and KEPCO plan to explore creating hydrogen and ammonia supply
chains in the Osaka coastal industrial zone.

•  The companies will study the development of infrastructure for ammonia storage and supply,
focusing on the Osaka region, and are in discussions with Kobe Steel, which could benefit from the
availability of ammonia supply.
•  CONTEXT: Mitsui holds Japan’s largest share of ammonia imports.


METI seeks to double 2030 target for installed EV chargers nationwide

(Nikkei, Aug 28)
•  METI issued a proposal to increase the installation target for EV chargers, including charging
stations, to 300,000 units by 2030.
•  This target is twice the current goal of 150,000 units, and it represents a tenfold increase
compared to the present number of installations. The guideline encourages installations in places
like commercial facilities.
•  CONTEXT: Charging infrastructure currently stands at around 30,000 units. The trend of having

multiple charging outlets per charger is growing. The proposal sees 270,000 units as regular
chargers in commercial facilities and 30,000 units as fast chargers at locations such as highways.


Panasonic starts glass-mounted PSC test at Fujisawa City

(Company statement, Aug 31)
•  Panasonic developed a prototype perovskite solar cell (PSC) module mounted on glass and
installed it on a balcony in a demo house in Fujisawa City’s sustainable smart town. The transparent
PSC module is 387.6 cm by 95 cm.
•  Panasonic claims that this is a world-first. The prototype will be in the demo house until November
29, 2024, during which time data will be gathered on its power efficiency and endurance.
•  Panasonic has a module with an area of 800 cm2 and 17.9% efficiency, a world record. Other
modules that post efficiency numbers in excess of 20% are much smaller.

•  CONTEXT: Panasonic is now the third Japanese company after Toshiba Energy Systems and
Sekisui Chemical to test PSC outside of the lab. The other two companies are testing PSC on thin-
films installed on building walls, which are more difficult to maintain since films absorb moisture
and dust particles easily. The drawbacks of glass-mounted PSC are a lack of flexibility and their
heavy weight, which is comparable to that of current silicon PVs. As such, some researchers do not
consider them to be “authentic PSC”.
• TAKEAWAY: This issue will come down to whether the cost of generating electricity from PSC tech is lower

than the ¥10-¥25/ kWh power utilities charge today. PSCs are expensive to make because gold or silver are
used as electrodes, and other materials made via nano-level process controls are costly. There have also been
questions about durability. Developers have reacted to some of these challenges by, for example, putting a
protective layer on top of PSC layers to lengthen the product-life of film-based PSC. However, this has in turn
further inflated costs and complicated the module production process, one university researcher told Japan
NRG. So, Panasonic may be being more realistic by putting its focus on glass-mounted PSCs.

Sekisui Chemical promotes PSC modules at ASEAN clean energy event
(Company statement, Aug 31)
o  Sekisui Chemical delivered a presentation of its perovskite solar cell (PSC) module at the
Clean Energy Future Initiative for the ASEAN (CEFIA) meeting in Indonesia.
o  CONTEXT: Last year, China’s DaZheng Macro-Nano Technology began the world’s first

mass production of PSCs. The ASEAN audience was most likely comparing Sekisui
product with that of DaZheng.


Scientists develop new method for all-solid-state battery production
(Nikkei Asia, Aug 30)
•  Scientists from the Tokyo Institute of Technology developed an innovative method for producing

all-solid-state batteries, potentially making their mass production more cost-effective compared to
traditional lithium-ion batteries.
•  This innovative method allows battery materials to be exposed to air during the manufacturing
process, reducing the need for expensive equipment.
•  The battery has high ionic conductivity and can withstand 300 charging cycles.
•  However, its temperature resistance and suitability for higher voltages are still not clear.
Researchers hope to commercialize the technology within the next decade.

•  CONTEXT: These batteries are seen as a safer alternative due to their lack of flammable solvents
and higher energy density. Several automakers plan to integrate all-solid-state batteries into
vehicles by 2030.

Mitsui acquires stake in RNG company in the U.S.
(Company statement, Aug 31)
•  Mitsui acquired a 33.3% stake in Terreva Renewables, a U.S. company that processes methane
from landfills to produce and sell renewable natural gas (RNG).

•  Mitsui intends to help Terreva grow its customer base; it sees opportunities for RNG value chains
to expand globally, including supplying RNG-based low-carbon products like methanol and LNG.
•  CONTEXT: RNG is gaining interest as a green alternative to fossil fuels, with increasing demand in
the U.S. for low-carbon transportation fuels like clean hydrogen and compressed natural gas
(CNG).




MOL to join feasibility study for CCS projects in western Japan
(Company statement, Aug 29)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) has been tapped to research the maritime transportation of liquefied
CO2 for a feasibility study of CCS projects in western Japan.
•  Apart from navigational plans for ships carrying liquefied CO2, MOL will also estimate
transportation costs and identify challenges related to sea transport of CO2.
•  ENEOS Holdings, J-POWER and JX Nippon Oil & Gas are also involved.

•  The plan calls for capturing CO2 emitted from J-POWER's thermal power plants and ENEOS'
refineries in western Japan, then annually burying about 3 million tons of CO2 under the seabed
off of Kyushu. The goal is to be operational by FY2030.

Over 70% of graduated FIT solar power systems intend to continue generation
(Denki Shimbun, Aug 30)
•  Research by the Renewable Energy Advancement Association for Long-Term Stable Power
Generation (REASPA), which surveyed 100 renewable energy companies, revealed that over 70%
of solar power generation operators plan to continue running their facilities even after the 20-year

purchase period under the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) expires. This is known as "graduating” from FIT.
•  The peak period for the disposal of solar panels, which were widely introduced in the mid-2010s, is
anticipated to occur in the late 2030s, after the graduated FIT period. However, considering the
survey results, it’s now believed that a second peak may occur in the 2040s as operators extend
project lifetime.
•  CONTEXT: Since the launch of the FIT program in 2012, solar power has rapidly expanded.
Installed commercial solar capacity exceeded 8 GW annually in both FY2014 and FY2015. The govt

had previously anticipated that the peak for disposal of panels introduced during this period would
occur around 2035-2037.


Round 17 solar auctions: lowest bid under ¥9.00/ kWh for the first time
(Japan NRG, Aug 25)
•  OCCTO held Round 17 of solar auctions. The number of bids (offered capacity) was 110.89 MW;
the auction price cap was ¥9.43/ kWh. There was a total of 55 bids, all successful. Of the total
capacity, 69.07 MW was awarded.
•  The lowest bid was ¥8.95/ kWh, under the ¥9 level for the first time. The highest was ¥9.43. The

weighted average bid was ¥9.30. The biggest was 15 MW.
•  The next bidding period will be from Nov 6 to Nov 11. It will offer 105 MW of capacity at a
maximum price of ¥9.35/ kWh.
•  CONTEXT: In June, OCCTO held Round 16 of solar auctions. For the first time, the auction was a
unified system. Previously, bids were split between FIT and FIP.
• TAKEAWAY: Compared to the previous auction, where there were 20 awarded projects for the full offered
capacity of 105 MW, this auction saw a significant decrease in capacity but a doubling of the number of

projects. This difference can be attributed to the fact that one single bid by Pacifico Energy was for 89.6 MW,
which accounted for 85% of the total solicited capacity.



Country’s top power distribution firms set up new company to aggregate data
(Nikkan Kogyo, Sept 1)
•  Japan’s 10 largest power distribution companies, including TEPCO Power Grid, Chubu Electric

Japan Nuclear Fuel resumes uranium enrichment operation after 6-year hiatus
(Denki Shimbun, Aug 28)
•  Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd announced the resumption of operations at its uranium enrichment facility
in Rokkasho, Aomori Pref. This is the first since Sept 2017.
•  Given the strong position of Russian companies in the international market for enriched uranium,

many nations are taking steps to reduce dependence on Russia.
•  CONTEXT: JNF's uranium enrichment facility began operations in March 1992 with an annual
production capacity of 150 metric tons of separative work units (SWU). It eventually expanded its
annual capacity to 1,050 metric tons of SWU. By FY2027, the plan is to reach an annual production
capacity of 450 metric tons of SWU. The facility aims to expand capacity to 1,500 metric tons of
SWU per year.

NRA to confirm TEPCO ability to operate Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, but restart delayed
(Nikkei, Aug 31)
•  The NRA convened to reconfirm TEPCO's suitability as a nuclear plant operator for the
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP restart. TEPCO hopes to restart Unit 7 in October but it faces obstacles,
including local consent.
•  TEPCO wanted to restart the plant in October, but that's impossible given that the NRA decided
to conduct inspections from mid-September.

•  Issues with terrorism countermeasures and nuclear protection at the plant are ongoing. The restart
process involves rigorous inspections by NRA and local consent.
•  CONTEXT: The combined electricity generation capacity of the NPP’s Units 6 and 7 is 2.7 GW,
equal to about 4-5% of Tokyo's demand. In July and Aug, the govt called for energy conservation
within TEPCO's service area. Restarting the plant could improve the situation and lower electricity
costs.

• TAKEAWAY: This is part of a very long process that may or may not lead to TEPCO operating a nuclear power
generation facility again. Since all previous deadlines for the restart of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP have been
blown apart, it’s anyone’s guess if this power plant will eventually be allowed to come back online and if
TEPCO will be the nameplate operator at the time. What possibly doesn’t help TEPCO’s cause is the fact that
the Tokyo area energy system has so far coped mostly well without the NPP’s contributions. Should that

situation changes, the govt may be more invested in seeing a faster resolution to the saga around the
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa restart.



KEPCO’s Takahama NPP Unit 1 resumes full operation; Unit 2 ready to start
(Company statement, media reports, Sept 3)
•  KEPCO's Takahama NPP Unit 1 (PWR, 826 MW) completed its final comprehensive load
performance inspection and resumed full operation.
•  Takahama Unit 2 (826 MW) has also passed its preliminary inspections and is on course to restart
on Sept 15. If that occurs, all seven nuclear power plants operated by KEPCO will have restarted

after the introduction of new regulatory standards and installation of new specialized safety
facilities.
•  CONTEXT: KEPCO, however, has taken Ohi NPP Unit 4 offline on Aug 31 for regular checks and
maintenance, so it won’t have all seven units operating at the same time.



Baseload market: agreements in all areas for two-year products

(Various media, Sept 1)
•  The Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) announced results of an agreement for the Base Load
(BL) market. It will see the first introduction of long-term products with a delivery period of two
years and change market area categories into three: Tokyo, Kansai, and Kyushu.
•  Two-year contracts (delivery from 2024 to 2025) were concluded for all three areas.
•  Kansai’s contracted volume was 96.4 MW, at a price of ¥14.21/ kWh; Tokyo was 99.1 MW, at
¥19.22/ kWh; Kyushu was 1.1 MW, at ¥14.35.

•  CONTEXT: METI and ANRE decided to change the rules of the BL market to allow for a better fuel
adjustment mechanism via longer contracts.



Non-fossil, non-FIT certificates trade at minimum price
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 1)
•  The results of the first trading session for non-FIT, non-fossil certificates for FY2023 were

announced on Aug 31.
•  CONTEXT: The Non-Fossil Value Trading Market was set up to auction certificates provided by
clean power sources that operate outside for the FIT scheme. The certificates represent the
“environmental value” of the generated electricity. In other words, the volume of CO2 that was
avoided because electricity was generated by non-CO2-emitting sources. This market covers
electricity generated both with FIT and without FIT.

Electricity Balancing Power Market Reform:
EPRX to Complete Makeover in 2024

As more renewables are brought online, the nation’s power trading is adjusting to
reflect the new market dynamics. And one of the biggest changes in the next 10
months or so will occur in the supply-demand adjustment trading segment, also
known as the “balancing market”.

Japan’s full liberalization of the power market in 2016 allowed a variety of new players
to trade and sell electricity. This drew interest to the electricity wholesale market, or
spot trading, and several years later two exchanges launched for futures contracts, as
well as a new platform for power capacity auctions.

Amid all the changes, the “balancing system” is one electricity marketplace that has
received little attention. This system is used by power firms to buy additional volumes
in case electricity demand surges above what’s expected, or the opposite. This
ensures that power supply always matches demand, keeping the grid stable and
preventing blackouts or wasted energy.

As the role of variable energy sources like solar and wind generation has increased, so
has the demand for flexibility and speed of response to balance the market. This is
what drives the changes to Japan’s power supply-demand adjustment market that
should be fully in place by fiscal year 2024.

METI recently provided more details about how the new balancing market will look.


Background
Before the electricity market liberalization, regional power utilities, or EPCOs (Electric
power companies), maintained the balance of electricity demand and supply using
their own power generation capacity, filling the gaps with energy sources such as
pumped storage hydro. In worse cases, they requested large electricity consumers,
such as factories, to curtail usage. This system was straightforward and efficient,
helping Japan boast one of the world's lowest blackout rates.

Once the power industry expanded to accommodate an influx of hundreds of new
electricity retailers, balancing the market became more complex and more important.
With the EPCOs told to unbundle their generation from transmission assets, it fell on
the newly independent transmission and distribution (T&D) companies to secure
balancing power volumes through open auctions.

The smaller volumes in the balancing market made it less attractive for new market
entrants, however. Thus, relatively few companies participated in supply-demand
adjustment trades. In all regions, the most active and even dominant traders of
balance capacity are the long-established EPCO groups.

With prompting from METI, the biggest power industry players decided to shift away
from an auction to a market system. This was to allow for the creation of a

17


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

comprehensive system that covered the entire country (apart from Okinawa), making
the process of balancing more efficient and more able to respond to short-term
adjustment needs stemming from a greater reliance on solar and wind power.

In 2021, the nine T&D companies related to regional EPCOs, such as TEPCO Power
Grid, Kansai Transmission and Distribution, and Kyushu Electric Power Transmission
and Distribution, formed a new market system operator – the Electric Power Reserve
Exchange (EPRX).

Since then, the EPRX has continuously worked to optimize the procurement of
balancing power, leveraging the "merit order" to ensure power system stability at
minimal costs. This transition dovetails with the planned integration of all EPCO power
control centers in the late 2020s.

According to a recent METI briefing with market participants, changes at the EPRX
should be completed in 2024.

"Merit order" refers to the sequence in which different power sources are dispatched based on their short-run marginal costs of
production. It's a system used by grid operators to prioritize the dispatch of power plants to ensure that the least expensive electricity is
used first. The merit order is particularly relevant in the context of power markets and electricity supply-demand adjustments.
Renewable sources like wind and solar often appear first in the merit order “stack” because, once installed, their marginal costs are minor.
Next might come nuclear and hydropower, followed by natural gas. So-called “peaking” power plants, which are usually gas-fired, are
expensive to run but can be started quickly. Traditional thermal power plants that run on coal or oil take longer to start and have higher
fuel costs.
The merit order effect becomes especially noticeable with a high penetration of renewable energy in the grid. On sunny and windy days,
the influx of cheap renewable energy can push out more expensive sources, leading to lower wholesale electricity prices. However, this
dynamic can also present challenges in terms of grid reliability and the financial viability of non-renewable plants, which may still be
needed for periods when renewables volumes are low.

New order
One of the biggest changes is the gradual introduction of new segments on the
balancing market that correspond with the different conditions of various power
sources.
The main balancing segments, or market products, are classified as "primary,"
"secondary," and "tertiary". The former tends to refer to resources that can offer a
near immediate response to power frequency deviations in real-time.

Secondary sources, such as natural gas peaker plants, can be called upon within a
short period, often minutes, to adjust for more prolonged imbalances. Tertiary power
corresponds to older thermal plants that run on coal or oil that require considerable
time to restart, but which can be dispatched to manage long periods of imbalance in
electricity supply and demand.

EPRX began its operations with two offerings:
1. Tertiary Balancing Power ② (launched in 2021): To adjust imbalances, especially
under specific programs, with operations commencing within 45 minutes of a
request.
2. Tertiary Balancing Power ① (launched in 2022): To address discrepancies
between forecasted and real-time demand, starting within 15 minutes.

Three more offerings are set to be introduced in 2024:
1. Secondary Balancing Power ②: Operational within 5 minutes.
2. Secondary Balancing Power ①: Also operational within 5 minutes but using a
distinct control mechanism.
3. Primary Balancing Power: Operational within a rapid 10 seconds.

Each of the above categories has different requirements concerning the duration for
which they should be supplied continuously and their control signals, LFC or EDC.

As per the current system, only Tertiary Balancing Power ② is traded on a daily basis,
with the rest is traded weekly.















Split by frequencies
Japan's unique power landscape, shaped over years with regional systems that are
operated independently by EPCOs, presents challenges for the market's evolution.
Also, making a nationwide marketplace allows to integrate the trading of electricity,
but it cannot overcome the physical challenges inherent in the power system.

19

The national power grid is bifurcated into 60 Hz and 50 Hz, and the capacity that can
pass from one region to the next is limited.

Despite the liberalization and the establishment of EPRX, the primary suppliers for the
upcoming 2024 offerings on the balancing market are projected to be the EPCO's
own generation companies. As noted earlier, most bidders for balancing auctions
today are the EPCOs themselves.

While the reforms offer an innovative solution, METI will need to closely monitor, and
when necessary, refine the balancing system to ensure the changes deliver a fair and
competitive market, while also promoting the nation’s decarbonization policies.

But above all, the government and EPRX will need to ensure stability and efficiency in
the power grid.

Paying for the Void:
Japan Looks for Business Model to Support CCS Projects

Japan spent around ¥100,000 ($686) per ton of CO2 to capture and store carbon
emissions in this technology’s first trial a few years ago – five times more than the
price of CO2 traded on any global carbon credits exchange. Luckily, the Carbon
Capture and Storage (CCS) tech demonstration off the coast of Tomakomai port,
Hokkaido, was almost entirely state-funded.

As the nation looks this year to promote CCS as a realistic clean energy solution and a
technology that’s vital to the decarbonization of heavy industry, such cost
performance will need to improve. At the same time, companies will also need to
create viable business models for a storage system that inherently stops generating
income once it’s full.

For now, the burgeoning sector is creating a buzz in Japan and attracting a wide array
of businesses, from utilities like J-Power to cement-makers and pulp & paper
companies. This is in part driven by growing state commitments in terms of funding
and other support measures.

Announcing plans for future CCS projects is one thing, finding the financing and
developing cost-efficient technologies is another. With many details in this industry as
yet unclear, Japan NRG has reviewed some of the calculations that will be involved in
CCS development.


What is CCS?
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been tapped as an integral part of Japan’s plan
to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It involves the capture of CO2 from power
generation and industrial facilities that use fossil fuels or biomass as fuel; prominent
among these are heavy industries like cement, steel or chemicals.

If not used on-site, the captured CO2 is compressed and transported by pipeline,
ship, or rail for use in a range of applications, or injected deep into the ground. The
two approaches are what separates CCS (i.e. storage only) from CCUS (in which the U
stands for utilization).

Unless the carbon is re-used to make plastic, concrete or biofuels, in which it carries
value as a raw material for a sellable product, carbon is essentially a cost. The expense
of capturing, moving and then storing it has to be covered by the emitter or a third-
party that’s invested in removing the CO2 from the atmosphere. In which case, the
cost of CO2 could be covered by a carbon credit, which typically represents just that –
one ton of CO2 removed from the air.

Credits are usually purchased by companies to offset CO2 emissions from their
operations. In this sense, a buyer of carbon credits “sponsors” the removal of CO2
from the atmosphere.

The world’s biggest carbon credits system, the EU’s ETS mechanism, is also among
the most expensive. Yet even on the ETS, the highest price to date is around 100
euros (¥15,864) per ton of CO2.

Japan’s carbon credits marketplace, being developed by the Japan Stock Exchange,
is currently in test mode with full-scale trading not expected before 2026. In trials
earlier this year, carbon credits derived from emission reductions in agriculture
received the highest price of ¥50,000 (per 1 ton of CO2) but in very limited trading.

So, for the economics of CCS and CCUS to work, the price of CO2 as a feedstock or
the cost of a carbon credit has to be higher than the cost of removing and processing
the carbon.


Preparing the soil for CCS
In FY2021, Japan’s total CO2 emissions amounted to about 1.07 billion tons, or
roughly 3% of the global total. CCS technology is believed to be capable of capturing
an estimated 90% of CO2 emissions from power plants and industry. In fact, CCS is
considered the only way to decarbonize Japan’s industrial sector without causing
significant financial losses that would leave many industries unable to compete.

Between 2008 and 2020, Japan ran a trial to demonstrate the technical capabilities of
CCS at the Tomakomai port on the island of Hokkaido. The experiment received ¥30
billion of state funds to capture and store 300,000 tons of CO2. The emissions were
injected as far as 2.6 km below sea level between 2016 and 2019, after which the site
was monitored. No leaks were found and the trial was deemed a success.

To follow up, the government has gradually sought to install a CCS regulatory
framework:
• In 2020, it announced the “Green Growth Strategy Through Achieving Carbon
Neutrality in 2050,” which for the first time positioned carbon recycling as an
important decarbonization technology
• In the 6th Basic Energy Plan from October 2021, the government positioned CCS
as a long-term project that needed to establish technologies, reduce costs, and
develop appropriate sites
• In FY2022, the government allocated about ¥54 billion for CCS R&D and set up
an experimental site for carbon recycling
• In the first three months of 2023, ANRE and METI unveiled long-term strategy
documents for a new CCS-based sector and flagged how it should be financed
• In June 2023, state energy enterprise JOGMEC selected five domestic and two
overseas sites for the first round of CCS projects that could be active by 2030
• The government plans to submit new CCS-specific legislation to parliament in the
coming weeks, which will aim to clarify how the industry supply chain should work
and certain technical and technological standards (“CCS Business Act”)

Further details on the above can be found in last week’s Japan NRG Weekly report.


What are the costs involved?
Interestingly, the government spent as much R&D funds in FY2022 on developing
business model configurations for CCUS as on development of its technologies,
according to METI’s annual report on energy (published in June 2023).

Below are some of the cost estimates for the industry that METI has come up with
through several working group meetings.

In October 2022, the working group worked out a cost estimation based on the
assumptions made by Research Institute of Innovative technology for the Earth (RITE)
as follows.

Reference: METI
The Ministry of Environment will finance development of separation and capturing
CO2, which is expected to be the most costly part of CCS tech, along with sea
transportation.
Further development of technologies to compress and liquefy CO2, and transport it
safely, is required to lower costs, according to METI, which suggests that the
government will also take on the bulk of the financing of these R&D efforts.
The total R&D expenses for technologies to transport CO2 by vessel alone are
expected to be around ¥18.5 billion, according to METI. Companies involved in this
R&D area began preparatory work in 2021 so that actual sea transport of liquid CO2
from the Maizuru thermal power plant (KEPCO) near Kyoto to Tomakomai in Hokkaido
(about 1,000 km) can begin in 2024. The trial should lead to the establishment of a set
methodology for the process by 2026.

Once this R&D succeeds, the construction cost for a CO2 tank onboard a transport
vessel and at onshore facilities will drop to ¥4.1 billion, partly thanks to the scaling up
of tank sizes.

Finally, there are the monitoring costs of CO2 once it’s stored underground. METI
estimates these at about ¥600 to ¥800 million per year for each CCS site. Twice in five
years, a 3D seismic assessment will be required, which increases the total annual cost
of monitoring to ¥1 billion to ¥1.2 billion.

Should the industry succeed in its initial phases, and achieve technology
breakthroughs, Japan expects that the overall cost of CCS will drop by up to 40% by
2050.


Funding the development
The financing and development of cost-efficient technologies is another major
challenge. After all, CCS requires significant capital expenditures in order to develop
its infrastructure.

Initially, the government has said that JOGMEC and other state actors will cover the
cost of searching for new CCS sites and the geological inspections of candidate areas.
Once it moves to a feasibility study stage, the costs will be shared between
companies and the government.

JOGMEC has announced an initial five sites in Japan and two abroad to provide up to
13 million tons of CO2 per annum by 2030 in storage capacity, but it then aims to
secure up to 20 to 25 sites by 2050 that could receive annually 120 million to 240
million tons.

The government also decided to provide 100% of the capital expenditures needed for
the development and construction of CCS sites in Japan. If a project is financed by
private sources, JOGMEC will be available to assist by providing funds as needed.

Once a CCS project is operational, state support will come via tax breaks or other
voluntary credits. One likely form for the latter will be credits under the Joint Crediting
Mechanism (JCM) that Japan has used to coin carbon credits abroad. METI said it also
wants to support the launch of an international crediting system for CCS-derived
emissions.

The biggest challenge that CCS businesses might face, however, could come at the
end once the reservoir’s capacity is full. When there will be no new tonnage of CO2
coming in, the operating company will be deprived of income from its core business.
Meanwhile, expenses associated with monitoring the site would remain.

How the business will work for the long-term and be financially sustainable – without
state support – is yet to be resolved.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Offshore wind
Europe slipped as the world’s largest offshore wind market. As a result of rising costs
and supply chain disruptions, the Asia-Pacific region, led by China, is now the leader.
In 2022, Europe accounted for about 47% of the 64 GW of total global offshore wind
capacity, while Asia-Pacific surpassed it with almost 53%. China alone made up 49%.

EU/ Fossil fuels
Fossil fuels produced just 33% of the EU's power in the first half of 2023, which is 17%
lower YoY, and the lowest share on record since 1990. The main reason was lower
electricity demand. Mild weather, consumption-cutting policies and high gas and
power prices have encouraged industries and consumers to curb energy use.

EU/ Solar power
The EU has 40 GW of solar panels stored in warehouses due to various bottlenecks
and barriers in the supply chain, including labor shortages, critical material delays and
long interconnection queues. This is equal to the amount of solar capacity that the EU
deployed in 2022. This figure might increase to 100 GW by year’s end.

India/ Net-zero
More than a dozen companies led by industrial conglomerate JSW Group wrote to
G20 leaders to push for an end to fossil fuels use without emissions captured, as well
as support for green vehicles and clean power. G20 leaders will gather in New Delhi
on Sept 9-10.

LNG
In the past year, Germany, the Philippines, and Vietnam began importing LNG. The
EIA also expects Australia, Cyprus, and Nicaragua to start importing LNG, and many
other countries are in the final stages of developing LNG import capacity. Global LNG
import capacity is set to expand by 16%, or 23 bcfd, by late 2024.

Namibia/ Oil
Shell and TotalEnergies will develop a giant oilfield in the Atlantic Ocean off the
African country’s coast. This year, Total will spend $300 million — half of its global
exploration budget — in Namibia.

Russia/ LNG
In the first seven months of this year, Belgium and Spain were the second and third-
biggest buyers of Russian LNG, behind China. Overall, EU imports of LNG were up
40% between January and July compared with the same period in 2021. Before the
war in Ukraine, the EU did not import significant amounts of LNG due to its reliance
on piped gas from Russia.

Saudi Arabia/ Nuclear power
Riyadh is speaking with China to build a nuclear power plant, a move that might be
meant to pressure the U.S. to compromise on its conditions. U.S. nuclear aid is

contingent on the Saudis agreeing to not enrich or mine their own uranium, which
China doesn’t demand.

U.S./ Offshore wind
The first auction of offshore wind rights in the Gulf of Mexico ended with a single $5.6
million bid, reflecting meager demand in a region known for oil and gas. Germany's
RWE won rights to the site off Louisiana, while the other two areas in Texas received
no bids.

U.S./ Power output
Total power generation from January to August 20 declined 2.1%, YoY. But the share
of power generated from natural gas averaged 40.4% through mid-August, up from
under 36% in the same period in 2022. This was due to low wind power output.
