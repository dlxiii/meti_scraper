Agrisolar leader CEE bets on business model, calls for improved legal framework

(Japan NRG, Oct 11)
•  In an exclusive meeting with Japan NRG, Chiba Ecological Energy (CEE) said it will expand its
agrisolar model that it believes can boost Japan’s food and energy security. Revenue is generated
from both farm and electricity sales.
•  CEE is testing the use of solar power generation with one-sided and double-sided PV cells and a
ratio of inclination from 31% to 48%.
•  CEE determined that crops suitable for agrisolar include satsumaimo (Japanese sweet potato),

eggplants, soybeans, figs and even eucalyptus.
•  CONTEXT: CEE, which is owned by tech entrepreneur Magami Takeshi, launched its first agrisolar
farm in 2018, and now operates four plants across roughly two hectares in Chiba Pref with total
capacity of 1 MWp. It sells the electricity via off-site PPAs.
•  CEE is a member of a local consortium working on decarbonization, and cooperates with
universities, public research institutions and energy firms on the use of tech to help address issues
such as labor shortages.

•  CEE’s study includes an analysis of a village energy management system. The firm has helped
more than 300 businesses launch agrisolar farms. The company is fully electrifying farming, using
different battery storage systems, including EVs and portable batteries for its equipment.
•  CONTEXT: Since Japan heavily relies on food imports, and has a rapidly aging and decreasing
farming population, the agrisolar model offers hope to improve food security and lower costs of
local farm produce.
• TAKEAWAY: While CEE’s business model is gaining interest from

entrepreneurs and firms that seek to set up similar agrisolar plants,
the sector faces bureaucratic obstacles. The legal framework is
unfavorable given that agricultural and energy generation
businesses are overseen by separate bodies (METI and MAFF).
Thus, agrisolar businesses struggle with strict requirements and
targets for agriculture yields and electricity generation that don’t

allow for simultaneous land use for different purposes. CEE also said
smaller businesses would benefit from a framework that enables
them to secure funding; under the current system – companies may
lose permits for use of farmlands if they do not meet crop yields
even if they are also producing an additional product in the form of
electricity.

METI announces documents adopted at G20 ministerial meeting
(Government statement, Oct 7)
•  METI announced the documents adopted at the G20 Energy Transition Ministerial Meeting held in
Brazil on Oct 4.
•  The meeting focused on: 1) financing the energy transition in developing countries; 2) social

aspects of the energy transition; and 3) sustainable fuels.
•  METI emphasized the need to achieve climate change measures, ensure energy security and
economic growth, and made the following remarks:
•  All member countries must work towards the common goal of net zero.
•  Japan will promote use of technologies via the Green Transformation (GX).
•  Japan will foster decarbonization with technology, funding, and human resources.

•  CONTEXT: The G20 Energy Transition Ministerial Meeting discussed energy policy, and aims to
strengthen policy coordination and cooperation on the energy transition.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI drafts strategy proposal to subsidize PSC use
(Jiji Press, Oct 8)
o  METI outlined a strategy proposal to promote the use of perovskite solar cells through

subsidies to users.
o  Since the price of perovskite solar panels is higher than that of conventional solar panels,
METI plans to subsidize the difference. The subsidies would be offered at locations with a
large area per PSC installation, such as roofs of public facilities.
o  The draft includes a plan for a production system for iodine, the primary material used in
PSC, and other raw materials, as well as support for international standards to promote
overseas development of PSC.




ANRE reviews progress of electricity system reform for next Basic Energy Plan
(Government statement, Oct 8)
•  Taking note of international experience, ANRE listed the issues vital to electricity system reform in
the context of revising the Basic Energy Plan.
•  The following concepts need to be addressed:

•  Promote decarbonization of power sources while ensuring reliable supply.
•  Establish a system for efficient use of power sources, including grid development, and flexible
supply-demand management.
•  Create a market for retail businesses that has stable prices.
•  CONTEXT: The Basic Policy Subcommittee of METI's Energy Council is discussing the next Basic
Energy Plan, examining the ongoing electricity system reform, taking into account opinions from

various industries and overseas experience. Europe, for example, has seen some declines in
industrial competitiveness since it drastically reduced piped Russian natural gas in spring 2022 and
sought to expedite the increase of clean energy’s share in the bloc’s energy mix.
• TAKEAWAY: Essentially, the Energy Agency wants to say that the stability of supply and price are its main
concerns during the transformation of the power grid and wider power sector to a decarbonized one. The
Agency is concerned that rapid moves to net zero in other countries have led to increased volatility of energy

systems.

Cabinet approved ordinances for Hydrogen Society Promotion Act
(Government statement, Oct 8)
•  The Cabinet approved ordinances and enforcement measures for the Hydrogen Society Promotion
Act, to take effect on Oct 23.
•  Revisions were made to ordinances that needed to be updated, such as hazardous materials

regulations, disaster prevention, earthquake measures promotion, etc.
•  The application fee for the production of high-pressure low-carbon hydrogen and other gasses was
set.
•  CONTEXT: The Hydrogen Society Promotion Act was enacted in May, and the official regulations
and other criteria were determined based on council members’ opinions and public feedback.
However, the METI ordinance that defines the standards for low-carbon hydrogen, etc, has not yet

been published.



Area in southern tip of Hokkaido eyed for 4th round of offshore wind tender
(Nikkei, Oct 7)
•  The area off Matsumae, on the southern tip of Hokkaido, will be added to a list of suitable sites for

offshore wind power projects for public tender.
•  By late March 2025, METI will start accepting applications for the fourth round of offshore wind
power development.
•  Total capacity to be auctioned will be about 300 MW.
•  CONTEXT: Hokkaido is gaining more attention from energy companies and investors partly due to
plans locally for a Rapidus plant that aims to manufacture cutting-edge chips, and a data center for
Softbank. Both projects will require vast amounts of electricity.

•  CONTEXT: KEPCO is considering building a large-scale offshore wind farm in the area, and is
assessing the project’s environmental impact. On July 31, KEPCO submitted a proposal to the
Hokkaido govt.
• TAKEAWAY: Since Hokkaido accounts for about 29% of Japan’s total potential for offshore wind power
capacity (via fixed foundation and floating turbines), the Matsumae site is likely to draw attention from major
developers. For the Matsumae offshore area to prosper, however, the govt will need to invest heavily in grid

upgrades with congestion and reserve capacity shortages among local issues. And in general, as more wind
power capacity is added off the coast of Hokkaido, installing more power lines from Hokkaido to the main
island will be vital.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

MoE urges KEPCO to reassess environmental impact of planned Hokkaido wind farm
(Government statement, Oct 11)
o  Environment Minister Asao called on KEPCO to revise its environmental assessment of a
planned large-scale offshore wind farm near Matsumae City, Hokkaido.
o  The minister requested KEPCO to:
o  Ensure that the facilities are separated from residences with respect to noise and wind

turbine shadows.
o  Conduct surveys, forecasts, and assessments based on advice from experts in order to
minimize the impact on wildlife, marine organisms and seaweed beds.

o  Minimize the impact on the landscape and maintain the characteristics of the view from
main viewing sites and facilities.
o  The utility plans to build a 360 MW plant and considers using 15 to 25 turbines (capacity
of 14 to 22.6 MW each). The site is within one of five promising zones designated by the
govt in 2023.
o  CONTEXT: In late July, KEPCO submitted a document on primary environment impact to

the Hokkaido Pref govt and METI. This is the first official statement on environmental
impact issued by minister Asao who assumed the office on Oct 1.



Google CEO: Tech giant might buy power from nuclear plants

(Nikkei Asia, Oct 3)
•  Google is mulling buying electricity from nuclear power plants for use at its data centers, said the
company’s CEO Sundar Pichai in an interview.
•  Pichai said Google is also exploring investments into solar, thermal, and SMRs.
•  The company faces major challenges as its AI operations have led to a 48% increase in GHG
emissions from 2019 to 2023.
•  Pichai said Google will cooperate with regulators such as Japan's Fair Trade Commission, which

began an investigation into the generative AI market.
•  CONTEXT: No details have been given when or from where Google might start sourcing nuclear
energy. Amazon and Microsoft are also exploring the purchase of nuclear-generated power.



FEPC mulls receiving high-level nuclear waste from France, to store at Rokkasho

(Nikkei, Oct 10)
•  The vice-president of the Federation of Electric Power Companies visited the Aomori Prefectural
Office, proposing a change in plans for accepting low-level radioactive waste (CSD-C) returned
from France.
•  FEPC proposed that an equal amount of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) is also received from
France and then stored at Japan Nuclear Fuel's facility in Rokkasho. But, the governor is opposed.
•  CSD-C is regulated by an agreement between France and Japan that sets a deadline for

completion of the spent fuel’s return by 2033. Since there is a large quantity involved – 1,800 units
– meeting the deadline will be difficult.
•  FEPC suggested exchanging the CSD-C for 20 units of HLW that are equal in terms of radiation
levels. The advantage is that this would greatly reduce transport costs.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
RFS postpones launch of Mutsu spent fuel interim storage
(Nikkei, Oct 4)

o  Recyclable Fuel Storage Co will postpone the start of its spent nuclear fuel interim
storage in Mutsu.
o  Originally set to launch on Oct 31, it’s now postponed to Nov 20.
o  The delay is due to prolonged inspections. The facility received its first metal storage
cask from TEPCO's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant on Sept 26.

OCCTO  discusses future grid operating capacity, load restrictions in emergencies, etc

(OCCTO statement, Oct 10)
•  The following topics were discussed at OCCTO’s working group:
o  Impact of large-scale introduction of renewable energy on operational capacity;
o  Load restriction in emergencies;
o  Improving the reliability of emergency power presetting switch (EPPS) operations.
•  Regarding the impact on grid operating capacity due to large-scale introduction of renewable
energy, the key issues were presented through an analysis from the perspective of balancing
capacity and security.
•  Load restriction is needed — in emergencies where the supply/demand balance collapses — in

order to maintain the frequency of the power system; but further study is needed on how to
respond to such situations and the technical issues involved.
•  EPSS is a function that allows instantaneous power transfer from the healthy side to the deficient
side when the frequency drops, but it may not work reliably under current conditions, so the set
values have to be reviewed.
•  CONTEXT: To discuss the optimal operational capacity, the Working Group on the Future

Operational Capacity was set up under OCCTO’s Committee on the Assessment of Balancing
Capacity and Supply-Demand Balance.



Thermal power producers fail to bid on OCCTO's reserve power sources

(Denki Shimbun, Oct 9)
•  As of Oct 1, OCCTO said it received no bids from thermal power producers for 1 GW of reserve
power sources in the eastern and western areas for FY2025-2026, when the system will take effect.
•  The reason is that power producers don't expect to make a profit even if they win in the bidding,
because it’s difficult to maintain the reliability of shuttered plants.
•  It seems that ANRE is confused by the unexpected results. The agency will now re-examine not
only its cost projects, but also the system’s conditions.
•  CONTEXT: The reserve power source system maintains standby power that can be activated within

a short period of time to provide the necessary supply capacity. The system is intended to secure
future capacity alongside mechanisms such as the capacity market and the long-term
decarbonization power auction.

JEPX electricity spot market prices rise, but avoids extreme spikes in Q3 2024
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 9)
•  The average spot market price on JEPX during the July to September period rose to ¥14.20/ kWh,
up ¥2.48 from the same period in 2023. This reflected higher demand due to record summer heat,

but did so largely without extreme price movements.
•  The most that prices jumped was during September, when more than half of the days saw the
price surpass ¥30 due to supply constraints and high demand.
•  The highest spot price for the quarter, at ¥100, occurred on Sept 23 in the Chubu area due to
ongoing transmission work and lingering heat.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TOCOM power futures volumes plummeted in August

(Exchange data, Denki Shimbun, Oct 9)
o  Trading volumes in August fell 38.9% to 41.1 TWh, despite record-high temperatures
and increased electricity demand. Without price spikes in the spot market, hedging
activity remained muted.
o  For the first time in nearly two years, LNG futures were traded in August, with 51
contracts settled, which is likely to fix power generation margins via spark spreads.




Marubeni’s retailer signs MoU with GHRE for supply of wind-derived power

Power-X installs BESS at Okayama post office to reduce electricity cost
(Company statement, Oct 9)
•  Power-X, a start-up in the storage battery sector, has installed a large-scale storage battery at a
post office in Soja City, Okayama Pref.
•  To reduce electricity consumption, the batteries will be used during times of high power use.
•  The firm also supplies electricity derived from wind and solar power, and expects to reduce the

post office’s total cost of electricity by 10-20%.
•  This is the first time Power-X has installed both its own large stationary BESS and power supply
service at the same location. Full-scale operation began on Oct 9.
• TAKEAWAY: The move confirms the trend of co-location and hybrid projects using battery storage by
combining it with, for instance, solar power generation or other services. However, it will take more time to
introduce such projects on a larger scale due to the high cost of existing BESS technology.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Sala Energy to launch its first BESS with solar PV
(Company statement, Oct 4)
o  In summer 2025, electricity and gas supplier Sala Energy will launch its first battery

storage with solar PV generation in Toyohashi City, Aichi Pref.
o  It will be Japan’s first non-FIT, non-FIP co-located facility with BESS and solar. Eneres will
trade the generated power.
o  The 2 MW/ 7.52 MWh facility will be on the site of the firm’s biomass power plant.
• TAKEAWAY: While BESS can enhance grid stability and power system flexibility, storage systems will require
energy-efficient and stable grid networks. The existing networks have not yet been tested in large-scale BESS

projects – Sala Energy is set to use a small-scale capacity BESS. Japan is still grappling with limited grid
network capacity, since grids are not unified and need a major overall to support new renewables capacity.

Kansai Electric shuts down Mihama NPP Unit 3 over piping issue
(Company statement, Oct 10)
o  Kansai Electric will shut Mihama NPP Unit 3 due to an incident during a routine

inspection on Oct 5. Salt deposits were found at two locations on the seawater system
main pipe, as well as two minor holes and thinning.
o  CONTEXT: The primary system uses seawater in cooling. It removes heat from pumps
and motors.
• TAKEAWAY: NPPs shut down automatically in case of a radiation leak or an abnormality in the control rods.
KEPCO had to shut down the reactor even though the incident does not constitute an emergency. Still, as per
NRA regulations, when abnormalities occur it’s necessary to halt operation and check the piping to determine

the cause.

Chubu Electric's tsunami estimate for Hamaoka NPP approved
(Kyodo, Oct 11)
•  The NRA approved Chubu Electric's estimate of a maximum potential tsunami height of 25.2
meters above sea level for the Hamaoka NPP.
•  The estimated tsunami height exceeds the current seawall height of 22 meters, indicating that

additional protective measures will be required.
•  Chubu Electric's estimate is based on the scenario of a massive Nankai Trough earthquake
followed by an underwater landslide off Enshu-nada, 68 km west of the plant. The NPP sits on the
Pacific Ocean coast.
•  CONTEXT: Chubu Electric applied for safety reviews of Hamaoka units 3 and 4 in 2014-2015, and
the seawall was completed in March 2016. But it has struggled to gain regulatory approval for a

restart since. The plant's Units 3 and 4 have been offline since 2011, and tsunami height has been
a key focus of the ongoing review.



Hamamatsu taps into private market as part of circular economy

(Nikkei, Oct 10)
•  Hamamatsu Energy, a public-private power retailer from Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Pref, will
increase the supply of power from renewables to SMEs in the region.
•  The power supply from the city's solar power and biomass power generation at the waste
treatment plant was about 39 GWh in FY2023; the company aims to double that to 78 GWh by
FY2030.
•  About 90% of the 520 power contracts signed in FY2023 were for public facilities such as schools,
while only about 60 were for private ones.

•  CONTEXT: The firm aims to introduce other renewables sources, such as hydroelectric and wind
power, to bring the ratio of locally produced energy from the current 70% closer to 100%.
•  CONTEXT: Hamamatsu Energy was founded in 2015 as the first municipal new power market
player. The city has set up a system to provide support for decarbonization management through
public-private partnerships. Hamamatsu has long been viewed as a pioneer in implementing new
frameworks and business models, for instance, through projects aimed at integration of non-

Japanese residents into the local community with support for schooling and employment.

Vaclav Smil: by 2050 world to rely on fossil fuels for 40-60% of total energy demand
(Japan NRG, Oct 9)
•  The world will still likely require fossil fuels for at least 40-60% of its primary energy production

despite the vast increase in renewable energy and decarbonization efforts, said Vaclav Smil, a
renowned Czech-Canadian scientist and energy policy analyst and author of several books on the
sector.
•  The difficulty of moving on from fossil fuels even by 2050 is that new cement, steel and chemicals
factories that run on coal, oil or natural gas are being brought online today, and these facilities
usually operate for at least 15-20 years. In the case of furnace-based production, facilities are not

easily stopped and cannot switch to alternative fuels at scale or within budget.
•  “The problem we have is not with the money or policies, it’s the scale of what we’re trying to
achieve,” Smil said at the ICEF conference in Tokyo. About 40% of final energy demand is hard or
impossible to electrify with current tech.
•  In 2023, the world consumed nearly 55% more fossil carbon than it did in 1997 (the year of the
Kyoto agreement), Smil noted.
•  To hit net-zero emissions by 2050, Smil advocated for
o  Using green hydrogen for only the most energy-intensive industrial processes,

o  Focus decarbonization on final uses that are easy to electrify today,
o  Intensify recycling of concrete and plastics
o  Introduce more cellulose-based substitutes for plastics.



S&P’s vice chair Yergin says LNG market tightness will be extended

(Japan NRG, Oct 6)
•  Daniel Yergin, vice chair of S&P Global and renowned energy author, forecasts that the current
tightness in supply in the LNG market, which was expected to dissipate in a year or two as new
production projects come onstream, will now likely extend for “another year or so”.
•  Some of the U.S. projects that were expected to be ready by 2025/26 are taking more time;
meanwhile, there’s additional demand from data centers, which “provide an exciting market

growth opportunity for the LNG industry.”
•  Yergin told the LNG Consumer-Producers Forum in Hiroshima that he believes “the world is
moving in a more pragmatic energy transition in which LNG will play a role.”
•  Yergin’s optimism for the sector contrasted with the more cautious outlook by Japan energy
agency commissioner Murase Yoshifumi, who said the LNG sector faces a highly uncertain future
due to trends in electrification, macroeconomics, and renewables development; and that both
buyers and sellers need to do more to reduce GHGs throughout the LNG value chain to win

support from outside the industry.
•  Murase was more optimistic about the outlook for integrating LNG with biomethane, e-methane,
and similar options to help with seasonal energy balancing needs and infrastructure utilization.

Japan mulls expanding LNG stockpiling scheme to 12 cargoes a year
(Reuters, Oct 11)
•  Japan may expand its emergency LNG purchasing mechanism to at least 12 cargoes a year from
three, said METI director energy resource division, Hasegawa Yuya. Japan wants to guard against

unexpected supply shocks.
•  This would boost the annual emergency stockpile buying to at least 0.84 million tons per year,
from 0.21 million tons now.
•  CONTEXT: China overtook Japan recently as the world’s largest LNG importer. But Japan still sees
a major role for LNG buyers to trade the fuel in the global market, especially in Asia.
• TAKEAWAY: Last year, METI introduced the emergency stockpile mechanism, known as the Strategic Buffer
LNG, and put JERA in charge of its administration. The mechanism was implemented only during the peak

power demand period of December to February, but it seemed likely that it would be expanded since three
cargoes are too small to make a difference in case of a major supply chain disruption. Effectively, Japan could
administer an LNG hedging mechanism simply by signing options contracts with LNG portfolio players to
supply the country in times of need (or face stiff penalties). However, there were times when such options had
been reneged on because the price of LNG surged, making it more lucrative to pay the fine and resell the
cargo. From a Japanese standpoint, that scenario is too much of a risk. METI is pushing for a stronger stockpile
mechanism to combat supply disruptions in case of extreme weather, heavy traffic in global shipping lanes or a

cold weather snap at home. The majority of LNG imports take at least 10-14 days to arrive in Japan and the
country lacks fuel storage facilities.




IEA could be open to stockpiling for critical raw materials: Agency director
(Japan NRG, Oct 9)
•  The IEA, which was created in 1974 to provide oil supplies to member countries in case of
emergency, would consider creating similar reserves for critical raw materials, said Sadamori
Keisuke, IEA’s director of energy markets and security, speaking at the ICEF conference.
•  “We aim to explore various cooperation among member countries to enhance security of critical

minerals. In some cases, stockpiling may be the answer. Japan and South Korea already have such
mechanisms. But, these critical materials are much more complicated than oil [in terms of storage].
They are basically an industrial material. So, it depends on what industrial base each country has”
and whether they can accommodate such stockpiling, Sadamori said.



Japan explores further LNG cooperation with South Korea, Italy

Chevron might sell its east Texas natural gas holdings to Tokyo Gas

(Japan NRG, Oct 9)
•  Chevron is considering selling its east Texas natural gas holdings in Haynesville Shale to Tokyo Gas
for around $1 billion. Chevron owns 72,000 acres of land in the area.
•  CONTEXT: Acquiring these assets would expand Tokyo Gas' presence in the U.S. shale market,
growing its potential natural gas reserves. The company recently made a $2.7 billion acquisition of
Rockcliff Energy, which produces about 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day.



JERA to recover critical metals from used EV batteries
(Nikkei, Oct 7)
•  JERA, Japan’s largest utility, will recover critical metals from used EV batteries, such as cobalt and
nickel. JERA’s goal is to raise the recovery rate to around 90%.
•  It will set up a dedicated plant for this extraction in the 2030s.
•  CONTEXT: Japan is heavily reliant on imports from China for such metals. Hence, the country must

find ways to recycle.
•  JERA's tech does not include a heat treatment process, which halves the amount of CO2 emissions
during recycling. It plans to apply high voltage in water and generate shock waves. The most
conventional tech for extracting nickel and cobalt from used EV batteries is via steaming, but the
recovery rate is limited to about 60% as the materials deteriorate in the heat.



LNG stocks up 1.5% over last week, and almost 8% YoY
(Government data, Oct 9)
•  LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 2.02 million tons as of Oct 6, rising 1.5% from the previous
week (1.99 million tons). This is 7.8% down from the end of October 2023 (2.19 million tons), and
the same as the past 5-year average (1.99 million tons).

•  CONTEXT: The first half of FY2024 ended in September; power utilities adjusted their stock levels,
and starting October they’ll start growing LNG stocks in preparation for winter.

Harris vs Trump: Their Energy and Climate Policies, and the Impact on Japan

The 2024 U.S. presidential race is more than just a clash of two very different
personalities. When it comes to energy policy, the divide is just as deep, and may
have an indirect impact on how Japan tilts its next strategic energy plan.

Voters in crucial battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where natural
gas fracking is a lifeline for many local economies, are almost evenly split. Their
opinion on energy and climate issues might even decide the results in those swing
states, which in turn will sway the entire election. Pennsylvania is the No. 2 gas
producing state in the U.S., which relies on fracked wells for over 90% of its natural
gas.

As during his time in the White House, Donald Trump remains a staunch supporter of
the nation’s fossil fuel industry and is skeptical of clean energy initiatives pioneered
and led by G7 partners. In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris is a loyal follower of
the Democratic Party’s climate-oriented policies that have wide support among global
institutions such as the United Nations, a body that Trump detests.

How that translates into voting, however, is less straightforward. For example, the
majority of American states with a high percentage of wind power generation tend to
vote Republican, even if
overall support for renewable
energy has slackened across
the U.S. over the last five
years.

Whatever the outcome of the
Nov 5 election, it will have a
strong impact on the
narrative in global energy
markets and climate
dialogue. As far as Japan,
among the items to watch
will be White House policy on
LNG exports, as well as the
future of ‘green’ tax credits
related to clean tech
investment.


Meet Kamala Harris
As Attorney General in
California from 2011-2017,
Harris forged an aggressive
track record in tackling the
fossil fuel industry, winning hefty settlements against Chevron and BP over pollution
violations from underground fuel storage tanks.

Then in 2019, while still a senator, Harris supported a Democratic resolution to create
the "Green New Deal," which was the first major progressive effort to shift the country
toward renewable energy. During her failed effort to run for president in 2020, she
went as far as to pledge a ban on fracking.

While that track record is applauded in liberal circles, today it’s costing her votes in
crucial swing states such as Pennsylvania where fracking and other forms of oil and gas
drilling add over $9 billion, or around 1.2%, to the local GDP. How to appeal to
working class voters in the shale gas heartland without alienating her urban coastal
base is the daunting challenge.

Pennsylvania was the first state outside of Texas to embrace fracking and plays host to
one of the country’s biggest shale formations, the Marcellus. It is also a state where
the Democratic Party is struggling to hold ground. Earlier this year, Biden paused all
new LNG export permits, and Harris won’t say whether she will lift the pause.

She’s also grown shy about commenting on fracking and won’t publicly support a ban.
Her opponents have seized upon this and lambasted her for flipping on the issue
since she was tapped as the Democratic Party’s nominee in late July.

But are Biden and Harris really such opponents of the fossil fuel industry? Biden has
been kinder to the industry than many think. While he talks tough on fighting Big Oil,
he’s done little to restrict output. In fact, under Biden, U.S. oil and LNG output soared
to record highs, and energy companies enjoyed vast profits. Unlike some major EU
states, Biden never imposed a windfall tax on earnings made when oil and gas prices
skyrocketed in 2022.


Nevertheless, this mini-boom in oil and gas was achieved while simultaneously
passing historic climate legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act, the $369 billion
initiative that’s propelling America’s energy transition. If she becomes president,
Harris has promised to finish implementing the IRA and accelerate the transition to
clean energy.

Despite the current election rhetoric, the Democratic Party is clearly open to both
fossil fuels and clean energy growth that can complement each other in a world of
rising energy demand.

Harris’ activist liberal base will be disappointed if they’re expecting her to prosecute
the oil and natural gas industry as she did in California. When it comes to politics on
the national and international levels, life is more complicated due to geopolitical
considerations and America’s obligations to allies across the globe.

How the U.S. energy mix changed under Trump’s first presidency




















Trump: What you see is what you get
Donald Trump is not shy about his plans to bring back the glory days of fossil fuels.
Among his energy goals are boosting domestic oil output, refilling the strategic
petroleum reserve, and expediting permits for drilling and leases on federal lands. He
hammers this home with the mantra “Drill, baby, drill”.

When he was in the Oval Office, Trump launched an offensive to deregulate in favor
of fossil fuels, and the U.S. became the world’s largest oil producer in 2018.

In his many recent campaign speeches, Trump paints a bleak future if Harris wins – the
fossil fuel industry will collapse, to be replaced by windmills and solar panels that he
claims are unreliable and will put the U.S. at an economic disadvantage. Trump also
wants to roll back the IRA, claiming that it’s been a “disaster”. He wants the U.S. to
regain “energy dominance” by pulling out of international climate agreements like the
Paris Accord.

Even if elected president, however, that won’t be easy, and he’ll need more than his
bully pulpit to push through his full energy agenda. Congress plays a big role, and
many Republican Congressmen support the IRA, noting that energy tax credits have
sparked technological innovation, investment, and created jobs, even in conservative
areas.

Trump dismisses wind and solar as expensive and inefficient, and he’s promised to
halt offshore wind development. When it comes to EVs, Trump initially opposed
Biden’s subsidies and vehicle efficiency standards, claiming they hurt the auto
industry. However, after gaining the support and financial backing of Elon Musk,
naturally he has modified his stance to be more open-minded on this topic.

On nuclear energy, Trump differs little from Biden and Harris, advocating for the
continued operation of existing reactors and supporting small modular reactor
development (SMRs).

Conclusion
As head of the world’s leading oil and gas producer, the next man or woman in the
White House will have enormous power and influence to decide the course of both
domestic and international policies on energy and climate.

Striking the right balance is challenging and crucial. Too much focus on climate carries
the risk of alienating voters who fear higher energy prices; however, too much
emphasis on drilling will undermine global sustainability goals and climate mitigation,
which will complicate relations with key allies.


The next president must find a way to unify the nation around an energy policy that
ensures security, fosters economic growth, and addresses the need to combat climate
change. As Japan currently reviews its own strategic energy vision to 2035 and maybe
2040, it will look at what kind of cooperation and to what extent the U.S. will be able
to offer.

While President Biden’s pause on LNG export approvals was understood in Tokyo as
political maneuvers ahead of a closely contested election, ongoing volatility in U.S.
energy policies and tax credits will surely have a significant impact on Japanese
expectations for imported energy supply security and collaboration.

Positive impact of CO2 - Climate Villain Becomes Agriculture’s Hero

The world would be a more efficient place if carbon dioxide that factories emit was
captured and transported to farms without escaping into the atmosphere.

In fact, greenhouse CO2
supplementation, which is the
process of feeding plants grown
in greenhouses extra CO2 to
enhance photosynthesis, has
been practiced in Japan for 60
years. In 2018, there were 1,440
hectares of CO2-supplemented
greenhouses, a figure that rose
to 2,120 hectares in 2022.

Scientists say that elevated
levels of CO2 are disrupting the
Earth’s regular climate patterns, but this vilified gas is also vital for the proliferation of
plant life and the entire food chain for all creatures on earth.

Japan NRG sheds light on the underappreciated contribution of CO2 in agriculture
and how smart tech is making a difference. New solutions are spilling over into hard-
to-abate sectors resulting in negative emission projects. The tightening of farm/
beverage-grade CO2 supply in the market is accelerating emission recycling not just
in agriculture but also in petrochemicals.


Tomatoes love CO2
In 2022, Japan’s agricultural sector emitted 14 million tons of CO2, excluding
methane and other GHGs. The emitted CO2 primarily comes from greenhouses
burning fuel-oil for heating. The fuel-oil derived CO2 can’t be fed to crops because it
contains over 100 parts per million (ppm) of NOx that damages plants. CO2 from
factories can’t be reused for growing plants either.

Source: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries

Today, farms use CO2 from their kerosene or LPG-fueled heating systems during
winter, and in warmer seasons buy compressed 99.9%-grade CO2 from industrial gas
suppliers such as Iwatani Corp.

There’s no data on CO2 system installations by crops, but the agricultural ministry
believes tomatoes have the highest share. Tomatoes are also the most popular indoor
crop. Kumamoto Prefecture leads Japan with the largest CO2 enriched area, as it’s
also the top tomato producer. Kumamoto is not blessed with sunshine, and so CO2
supplementation gained traction.

“We didn’t promote it, there was no subsidy; it spread organically because it
worked…and before we knew it, we were the forerunner of CO2 tech,” said a
prefecture official. Kumamoto also has clusters of big farms that seek to streamline
labor intensive processes, and are technology hungry.

Strawberries come in second, and eggplants are possibly the third. Kochi Prefecture,
with the second largest CO2 supplemented area, is the country’s top eggplant
producer. Tomatoes and strawberries grow well at about 2,000 ppm of CO2 intensity;
lettuce at 1,800 ppm; and other crops in lower intensities.

At dawn when plants begin to perform photosynthesis, CO2 measures 500-900 ppm.
CO2 starts to flow into the greenhouses from the roofs or sidewalls. The feeding stops
before noon or continues into the afternoon. The procedures vary depending on the
greenhouse structure and size, crop varieties and growth stages, weather, etc. The
process is automated at farms with hectare-sized greenhouses.

Plant CO2 consumption rises in summer when photosynthesis is most active, but slows
when it gets too hot. The threshold temperatures vary according to plants.

CO2’s other heroic moments
In the last ten years, CO2 application has spread to insect control. Farms fill the
ground of greenhouses with CO2, shutting them for up to one day to suffocate the
insects. The CO2 pest control equipment was commercialized in the late 2010’s, but
sales didn’t take off. Investment in equipment and staff training is not effective if used
only once or twice a year.


CO2 is also used for post-harvest treatment of crops. Fruits contain tannins causing
bitterness, but the taste becomes mellow after reacting with CO2. Also, CO2 is used
to prevent worms and weevils in dry crops. CO2-based insect control techniques,
however, are more widely applied in medicine than agriculture.

There are no official statistics on CO2 consumption at farms. One farmer with a
hectare-sized open-roof and wall tomato greenhouse said he consumes 20 tons/
month. The consumption tends to be greater for airtight greenhouses. The total
demand of CO2 for supplements, insecticides and post harvest treatment adds up to
several thousand tons per month, Japan NRG estimates. This is roughly 10% of the
total CO2 consumption in industries.

CO2 packed in cylinders is truck-delivered to farms, and the vehicle emissions could
offset the volume absorbed for photosynthesis. Gas suppliers drive to customers in
the mountains where the sun sets at 3 p.m. The state awards carbon offset credits to
farms using CO2 from their heating systems, but not for the use of CO2 purchased
from third parties.

“Positive impact CO2” to grow
In 1999, Japan’s total indoor farms covered 53,516 hectares, decreasing to 37,895
hectares in 2022. The decline is due to family-owned farms retiring, but state data also
shows a rise in farms incorporated or owned by non-family groups; and they own
larger plots of land.

Experts believe that the indoor farm space will keep stable at about 40,000 hectares.
Because Japan is exposed to typhoons, farms plan greenhouses discreetly. But a new
breed of tech savvy farmers, who have larger investment capacities, are emerging.

Manufacturers and energy companies are starting to farm, seeing opportunities in
smart-farm solutions which are presently imported. Power utilities were at first helping
farms switch to electricity from fuel oil, and some ties developed into joint ventures.
The farms are test beds for analysis tools of CO2 supplementation parameters, robots
for CO2-based insect control, heat pumps, etc.

Power utilities involved in the smart-farm business:

A system that combines CO2 recycling, utilization and automated management went
on-stream in 2020. Food manufacturer Kagome started to feed CO2 emissions, via
pipelines, from its LNG-fueled factory to its tomato greenhouses in Nagano
Prefecture.

CO2 recycling is spreading to biomass power plants. In 2021, SymEnergy and Omnia
Concerto began to study lettuce with CO2 from a biomass power station. Omnia
Concerto together with Sumitomo Osaka Cement developed a bioenergy with carbon
capture and storage (BECCS) model: the CO2 from the power station, after removing
NOx and SOx, will feed the cedar tree plants, and when the plants grow to trees, they
are used as fuel. Sumitomo launched the BECCS pilot study in August 2024.

High-grade CO2, the new heroes
CO2 has been a hero for 60 years in the agriculture sector, and other sectors are
recognizing its virtues thanks to the “CO2 supply crunch”.

Presently, Japan’s CO2 demand outstrips supply as the domestic “raw gas” feedstock
is becoming scarce. In 2023, the country’s CO2 imports swelled to 22,536 tons from
9,364 tons a year earlier. Prices shot up. Strong demand and prices are incentivising
recycling. Cosmo Energy and Tokai Carbon, the buyers of CO2 for petrochemical
products, plan to recycle their emissions for in-house consumption.

Recycling CO2 for petrochemicals products is more ambitious than for plants because
of the high carbon density required. Plants can take any CO2 so long as NOx and SOx
are removed.

The recycling process is simpler for NOx/SOx-free CO2: filter the emissions through
desulfurization, denitration and air purifier equipment, rather than treating the gas
with amine chemicals that absorb NOx and SOx, and filtering it multiple times to
reach a high CO2 density. Factories already have desulfurization and denitration
equipment as required by law.


The spread of “re-use” culture across industries will boost the supply of high grade
CO2 and its utilization, making an overall positive impact.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

AI / Renewable energy
The IEA predicted that artificial intelligence and data centers will sharply increase
demand for renewable power, possibly tripling to 262 TWh by 2026 compared to
2023. AI’s share of demand in renewable power generation could double to 18%.

Australia / Waste power
The country’s first commercial-scale waste plant, the Kwinana Energy Recovery facility
south of Perth, has launched. It can burn 460,000 tons of non-recyclable waste a year,
equivalent to about 25% of Perth’s annual landfill waste,

Australia/ Solar power
Pilot Energy, an oil and gas explorer, said it received an offer from EDP Renewables
APAC to take full ownership of the 376 MW Three Springs solar farm in Western
Australia. The deal is estimated to be about USD 8 million.

China / Petrochemicals
China Energy Investment, one of the country’s largest miners, will begin building a
$24 billion facility to turn coal into oil products and provide feedstocks to the nation’s
petrochemicals industry. Located in Xinjiang, the facility will come online in 2027, and
will be powered by renewable energy.

China / Renewable energy
The IEA said that China will account for almost 60% of all renewable energy capacity
installed worldwide through 2030. Globally, over the next six years renewable energy
projects will roll out at three times the pace of the previous six years, led by China and
India.

Floating offshore wind
The global pipeline of floating offshore wind farms rose 9% YoY to a capacity of 266
GW, said RenewableUK; and the number of projects rose from 285 to 316. Currently,
only 245 MW of floating wind is fully operational across 15 projects in seven countries.
Globally, 102 MW is under construction, with 203 GW in various planning stages.
South Korea and the Philippines have the most projects in the pipeline.

India / Oil & Gas
India will reform regulations and invite foreign oil majors to explore both onshore and
offshore as it races to extract as much oil as possible while there remains a market for
crude, the country’s oil and gas minister has said.

Indonesia / Biofuel
New higher biodiesel mandates in the world's biggest palm oil producer are likely to
tighten supplies of the vegetable oil. Indonesia has a mandatory 35% blend of palm
oil-based fuel in biodiesel and seeks to ramp that up to 40% to cut energy imports.
The plan, if implemented, could see biodiesel consumption rise to 16 million kilolitres
next year.

Malaysia / BESS
Leader Solar Energy II and Plus Xnergy Services will deploy Malaysia’s first sodium-
sulfur battery energy storage system (BESS). PXS will install the 1.45 MWh capacity
BESS in LSE’s large-scale solar farm at Bukit Selambau, Kedah.

South Korea / Renewable energy
The IEA said that in 2023 less than 10% of the country's electricity generation was
from renewable sources, falling far short of global (30.25%) and Asian (26.73%)
averages. Renewable energy accounted for less than 6% of South Korea's total energy
supply in 2022.
