NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY







Japan revises hydrogen strategy, seeks sixfold increase in hydrogen supply by 2040
(Government statement, June 6)
•  METI unveiled a revised Basic Hydrogen Strategy that will promote hydrogen use and increase the
annual supply sixfold, reaching 12 million tons of hydrogen by 2040.
•  Over the next 15 years, Japan plans to invest more than ¥15 trillion from both public and private

sources to support the development of hydrogen-related supply chains. The state sees its
contribution as around ¥6-8 trillion.
•  The revised strategy mentions key areas such as water electrolysis tech, fuel storage batteries and
transport tankers. It sets a target for Japanese firms at home and abroad to create 15 gigawatts of
electrolyzer capacity by 2030, from less than 1 GW now.
•  Hydrogen target costs are ¥30/ Nm3 by 2030 and ¥20/ Nm3 by 2050. For ammonia, less than ¥20/

Nm3 by 2030.
•  It will also support synthetic fuels and ammonia produced using hydrogen, seeking partnership
with Australia and the Middle East to set up global supply chains.
•  CONTEXT: Japan unveiled its first Basic Hydrogen Strategy in 2017. The revised strategy calls to
increase hydrogen supply from the current 2 million to 3 million tons by 2030, reaching 20 million
tons in 2050. Since the hydrogen industry is still in its initial phase in Japan, there are many steps
to take before commercialization, especially in legislation and in infrastructure.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan was one of the early countries to adopt hydrogen as a clean source of energy, to fill in the

gap of lagging behind decarbonization strategies in the fossil fuel sector. However, in the past several years,
due to lack of detailed action plans, other countries and regions moved ahead at faster paces. Now that Japan
has finally revised its hydrogen strategy to keep up-to-date with numerical targets in sight. It may be late, but it
is never too late to take actions towards achieving net zero emissions by 2050.



Japan's SBI to set up carbon emissions exchange
(Nikkei Asia, June 7)
•  SBI Holdings plans to open an exchange for trading carbon credits in Japan and abroad, following
a similar move by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Called Carbon EX, it will be operated by a JV formed

by SBI and Asuene.
•  The goal is to increase price transparency and facilitate trading of CO2 emission rights. Renewable
energy companies and forest conservation projects will sell credits, while companies unable to
reduce emissions can buy them.
•  Carbon EX will handle both public-sector and private-sector credits, with a focus on international
certification organizations like Verra.
• TAKEAWAY It’s uncertain how many companies will participate in the TSE’s exchange for trading carbon

credits. One of the main reasons why companies hesitate is the limited number of tradable credits, which


4


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

under the TSE will be restricted to domestic ones (mainly J-Credit and JCM). Opening the exchange to
international credits may be more attractive.

• For more details about SBI’s partner, Asuene, see this week’s Anaysis section.

NEWS:     POWER     MARKETS






Goldman to enter Japan’s power trading market; Mizuho mulls the same

(Bloomberg, June 6)
•  Goldman Sachs is setting up a trading desk to handle Japanese electricity contracts. The bank is
the latest to show interest in the power sector in Japan as the government pushes more
participants to hedge exposure to volatile energy prices.
•  One of Japan’s largest banks, Mizuho Financial Group, is also considering the same move. The
bank is keeping a close eye on the market.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s power market was liberalized in 2016, which led to an influx of new entrants
keen to retail and trade electricity. Since 2020, two trading platforms for electricity futures

contracts have been set up. The biggest of them, run by the European Energy Exchange, said its
trading volumes surged 400% in April, YoY.
• TAKEAWAY: There has been a steady increase in the number of new entrants to Japan’s power market in the
last year or so, with many international investment, energy and trading companies mulling the idea. Quite a
few have committed, but the arrival of Goldman and one of the domestic mega-banks would boost the
prestige and liquidity of the Japanese derivatives market considerably. Also, several large overseas power
traders are about to enter the market.



TOCOM: Electricity futures decrease by 38% on diminishing hedging

(Exchange report, June 7)
•  The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) said the volume of electricity futures contracts for April
saw a significant decline of 38% compared to the previous month. This indicates a weakening
demand for hedging among market participants.
•  The reduced demand for hedging is due to various factors, including stabilizing electricity prices,
favorable weather conditions, etc. Thus, market participants are less inclined to actively engage in
hedging activities using electricity futures contracts.
•  CONTEXT: TOCOM is one of two exchanges in Japan that handles the trading of electricity futures

contracts.
• TAKEAWAY: Volumes will fluctuate with the season and price volatility, but on the whole the trend for
electricity futures in Japan is definitely one of growth. Currently, the larger of the two exchanges for power
futures in Japan is the European Energy Exchange (EEX), which claims to have a more than 90% market share
in the segment. The EEX said that its volumes jumped almost 400% in April YoY.

| in the segment. The EEX said that its volumes jumped almost 400% in April YoY. |

•  CONTEXT: The reserve power capacity ratio in the metropolitan area in July could drop to 3.1% in
case of extremely hot weather.
•  Since electricity demand could swing about 3% from the anticipated level, it is necessary to secure
at least a 3% reserve, according to METI.
•  The govt issued a nationwide power saving request from July to September last year, but the latest

request only targets the area served by TEPCO.


JERA to begin co-firing hydrogen in U.S. gas-fired power plants
(Denki Shimbun, June 8)
•  After a six-month delay, JERA began co-firing hydrogen at a gas-fired power plant in the U.S., with
plans to achieve a ratio of 40%.

•  Unit 6 of the 972-MW Linden gas-fired power plant in New Jersey mixes a by-product gas that
includes hydrogen supplied from nearby oil refineries, with natural gas to generate electricity.
•  This is JERA’s first project to implement hydrogen co-firing in a thermal power plant; the
knowledge gained from this project can be applied to power plants in Japan.
•  CONTEXT: JERA holds a 50% stake in Linden Cogeneration Holdings, the operating company of
the power plant. The upgrade of the power plant started in October 2021, and was slated to be

completed by December 2022, but problems with materials caused the six-month delay.
• TAKEAWAY: In Japan, JERA has focused on co-firing ammonia at coal power plants. In the U.S., it is exploring
the pairing of hydrogen with natural gas. The company has said in the past that the fuel choices are based on
supply options and cost.



Proposal to cover maintenance costs of backup power sources with transmission fees
(Denki Shimbun, June 8)
•  There is a growing demand for proper implementation of "mid-term adjustments" to reflect
additional costs incurred during the regulatory period of the revenue cap system for transmission
fees, which started in April and will continue until FY2027.
•  Mid-term adjustments target unexpected costs that were not accounted for when the revenue cap

was established, and therefore cannot be managed as is by transmission and distribution
companies (T&D).
•  A proposal was made to cover the maintenance costs of backup power sources with transmission
fees. If this proposal is approved, it will increase expenses for T&D operators. This should allow
T&D firms to apply for an increase in the revenue ceiling, based on changes in energy policy or
other circumstances.

•  CONTEXT: If the makeup of the backup power supply system is implemented as currently
proposed, the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (ESG) will be responsible for
overseeing the system and determining the need for mid-term adjustments. The commission's
views indicate that adjustments in the next regulatory period will be based on discrepancies
between estimated and actual costs in the current period.

ANALYSIS

BASED ON MATERIALS
IN SHIN ENERGY SHIMPO

Venture Companies Rush to Create
New Tools to Calculate CO2 Emissions

A new wave of startups in Japan is emerging, eager to equip domestic and
international businesses with the tools to measure and subsequently reduce their
carbon emissions.

In just the last two years, several firms have come forward to create a new market for
software tools that claim to identify Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for clients, while also
presenting data in an easy-to-grasp manner. Many of these providers also hope to
leverage their data offering into advisory services based on CO2 reduction strategies.

Since the 2015 Paris Agreement, which encourages enhanced transparency and
reporting of climate impact by businesses, the private sector has been under
increased pressure to provide more info on its carbon footprint. To help with such
disclosure, entities such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD) were formed. The TCFD, for example, provides guidance on climate-related
financial reporting for companies, including how to measure and report greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions. But applying such guidance is tricky.

At present, such reporting in Japan is voluntary. However, more and more of the
country’s listed companies are feeling pressure from the Tokyo bourse, their
shareholders and other stakeholders all asking them to explain their environmental
impact and that of their supply chains. For blue chips with significant global sales, it’s
become imperative to align disclosures with internationally recognized frameworks
such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

Based on such circumstances, the market for CO2 measuring and visualization tools is
booming.


Knowing where to start?
Software as a Service (SaaS) tools to calculate and visualize CO2 emissions first
appeared in Japan around 2021. The tools offered not only to help businesses map
their carbon footprint but also to identify which areas can be targeted for CO2
reduction first, bringing a sense of order and priority to a decarbonization agenda.

booost technologies
Among the first in the field was booost technologies. Founded in 2015 by Hirokazu
Aoi, a former consultant from a top-tier firm, booost started by providing support
systems for new entrants to the power market. It later expanded into measuring CO2
emissions and now offers a tool called boost GX.

The company targets major enterprises and blue chips. According to boost,
companies that account for 7.3% of Japan's total emissions now use its platform.
Building on this success, in February the startup launched a “Sustainability Cloud”
service that covers not only the ‘environment’ but also the other components of ESG,

17


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

and makes a company’s disclosure visible online. What’s more, the tool shows
emissions as monetary values.

Major partners and clients include Persol P&T and NTT East and West. Within three
years the company aims to service 30% of all firms listed on Japan’s Prime and
Standard markets.

Zero Board
Another startup in this space is Zero Board, established by Michitaka Tokeji. He has a
background in finance and energy, having worked for JP Morgan, Mitsui & Co. and
A.L.I. Technologies. He was also a member of METI’s Council on the Calculation and
Verification of the Carbon Footprint (CFP) for Carbon Neutrality in the Entire Supply
Chain.

Zero Board has developed a tool called 'zeroboard' that can track both company
emissions and CFP on a product basis. The tool is also expanding functions as it gets
more data, and it sends out questionnaires to suppliers to collect that information.
Many of the startup’s staff used to belong to the ESG departments of large
companies.

Zero Board claims that more than 2,300 companies have signed up for its service, and
partners and clients include Toyota Tsusho, Kansai Electric, Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, and
Iwatani Corp. The company also has a subsidiary in Thailand so that it can help to
visualize the supply chain emissions of Japanese manufacturers in that country.

Zero Board is also developing specialized solutions for the construction and logistics
industries. With an eye on the enforcement of the Corporate Sustainability Disclosure
Directive (CSRD) in Europe, the company will expand service to include solutions for
managing overall ESG indicators and consulting.

Asuene
Asuene is headed by Nishiwada Kohei, a Mitsui alumni who used to help the trading
house invest in renewables in Japan and overseas. After working on the retail of green
electricity, the startup began offering the "As Zero" cloud service in August 2021.

Asuene offers its product through direct sales and via third parties, and claims to have
worked with more than 3,000 companies. It is also the only company in Japan to be
certified by CDP as a partner in both climate change consulting and scoring. Its
emission reduction support service includes solutions such as how to procure
renewable electricity, credit offsets, biomass fuel and solar power generation.

In November 2022, the company released the ESG Cloud Rating, an ESG evaluation
cloud service for sustainable supply chain procurement, and in February it added a
water management function to address wider ESG issues. Water security information
disclosure is required by the CDP, TCFD, and SBTi.

Asuene’s CFAO Eto Kazuya explains: "It is extremely difficult to calculate and visualize
CO2 emissions, which requires selecting the most appropriate formula from a variety
of calculations and performing quantitative analysis.”

The company established a local subsidiary in Singapore, and later formed a
partnership with Pavilion Energy, the largest local energy company. In February 2023,

18


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

the Japanese firm also formed a partnership with Asteria. By integrating Asteria's
Warp, which links all systems with no code, they have built a platform that makes data
collection even easier. In the future, the company plans to establish API tie-ups with
other system management tools.

e-dash
About two years ago, e-dash was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsui,
which is developing a tool called "LCA Plus" (to make life cycle assessments of a
product’s GHG). E-dash specializes in corporate emissions calculations, and it can also
provide support for procurement of non-fossil certificates and the introduction of PV
solar power generation.

The startup says it counts on more than 140 regional banks and credit unions as its
"most important partners", according to President Yamasaki Toma. It’s focusing on
the decarbonization plans of local governments and local SMEs. One of these, the
Gifu Shinkin Bank, has adopted the Sustainability Linked Loan (SLL) framework. By
using e-dash to track emissions and reporting them to Gifu Shinkin Bank, the lender
can structure loans without the cost of doing a third-party evaluation from a rating
agency that’s normally required for SLLs.

In addition, clients such as Gifu Shinkin Bank will provide information into a partners
portal to eventually help everyone involved calculate Scope 3 emissions.

In February, e-dash announced a one-stop service to create energy efficiency and
conservation legal term reports utilizing existing energy data.

Blue Dot Green
Blue Dot Green Inc. does not develop its own tools, but it supports companies in
disclosing information such as emissions calculations. The parent company of Blue
Dot Green is S-Pool, a business process outsourcing (BPO) company, and it deals with
many customers that have tried using CO2 tracking tools but have not been able to
get the output they wish.

The company has provided support to about 400 businesses and it also acts as a CDP
scoring partner, receiving a particularly large number of requests for this service.

Blue Dot Green intends to get involved in supporting decarbonization plans of local
governments. Recently, S-Pool formed an alliance with Kitahiroshima Town in
Hiroshima Prefecture, which has declared itself a "zero-carbon town."


Conclusion
Calculating CO2 emissions is still an evolving area and the companies discussed
above are the first to admit that many challenges remain to implementing such
systems. This is in part due to data availability and the need to cover not only Scope 1
and 2 emissions but also Scope 3.

Still, the number of service providers in this emerging field is increasing as more firms
consider climate reporting a vital part of doing business. And as companies start to
get a better grasp of what impact they and their supply chains are having, they are
showing an appetite for advice on concrete GHG reduction measures. That seems to
be a natural evolution for this rapidly growing niche. X

COLUMN:       ENERGY      JOBS   IN  JAPAN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Does the ‘Lifetime Employment’ Mentality Still Exist?

Japan has long been famous for its lifetime employment system. Companies have
traditionally stood for social protection of their employees’ wellbeing, offering a job
for life and a pension that took care of the family after workers retired. In return,
workers pledged a level of loyalty virtually unseen elsewhere in the world, and put
work for the company’s benefit above their own personal career goals.

This lifetime employment mentality has been a factor in the design of the highly
structured Japanese educational system. The most prestigious, stable Japanese firms
tend to hire new graduates en masse from a select few top universities, which in turn
accept applicants from select elite high schools. In such a system, one’s position in
society can be determined early in life.


Stigma of changing jobs
According to the Japanese Statistics Bureau, the average tenure for a full-time
employee is 10 years. This is more than double the average tenure in the U.S., and
almost double the average in leading European countries.

Under Japan’s lifetime employment culture, workers are rewarded not only for
performance, but also for loyalty and tenure. Salary increases with seniority in the
company, and promotions strongly factor in track record within that business.
Therefore, it’s a difficult decision for management to promote a mid-career hire over a
loyal employee who has contributed to the firm since having joined as a new graduate
many years prior.

Due to this cultural landscape within large firms, it has traditionally been difficult for
employees to move up the corporate ladder by changing firms. Workers might
change companies for personal or family reasons, or leave due to a negative
experience or situation, and seek opportunities elsewhere. Not unlike countries with a
caste system, it’s easy to move down, but very difficult to move up. In the majority of
cases, those joining a new company mid-career had to accept a lower salary, and
often position, than in their original firm. And then they had to face the challenge of
being seen as an outsider with a slower promotion pathway.


Market shifts and foreign investment brings a tide of change
In recent years, two major changes have been upending long-held views on job
change. Firstly, as Japan’s population grew and became more affluent, the market
became more attractive for foreign companies. But often they don’t have the ability to
conduct many hires, and train new graduates into their system as established
domestic firms do. Therefore, they must rely upon their ability to attract mid-career
talent. The challenge for foreign companies has often been to prove that they’re
stable, and to market themselves as attractive for top candidates.

After all, for top talent who have studied hard since childhood to join one of Japan’s
prestigious banks, trading houses or top manufacturers, joining a gaishikei (foreign

20

capital firm) will surely be seen as a step down socially! Multinational companies have
had to attract talent by offering higher positions and larger salary packages, therefore
creating a market where employees could move up by changing firms mid-career.

Secondly, rapid market shifts have left highly attractive Japanese firms short on
potential talent. Though Japan’s corporate giants have a high volume of human
resources, when the market shifts faster than their hiring strategy can recruit talent,
they’re forced to fill in the gaps with mid-career hires. In the energy market, a clear
example is the expansion of the traditional energy and infrastructure businesses into
energy technology and distributed energy systems.

As trading houses focus more on investing in energy technologies, commercial
decarbonization solutions and AI/IoT areas, they find that to maintain a competitive
advantage they need to acquire qualified talent faster than they can train via their new
grad hiring structures. Looking at the makeup of mid-career vs original employees in
the ‘Energy Solutions’ team of any trading house compared to the ‘Energy &
Infrastructure’ team illustrates this point.


Current market status
In contrast to the Japan of the early 2000s, a growing segment of high performing
talent is choosing to leave their original companies at a time where they still have a
good career path internally. An increasing number of talented employees see an
external move as an option to accelerate and advance their careers. From our own
data acquired by interviewing thousands of Japanese professionals, common reasons
for this are as follows:
•  Belief that foreign firms promote on a meritocratic basis rather than according
to seniority
•  Dissatisfaction with being rotated into a position not aligned with their goals
•  Desire to increase the pace of their promotion and earning potential
•  Interest in gaining exposure to global technologies and honing their
specialization
•  To take on a wider role in a smaller organization to develop management
skills

Titan recently supported a Japanese professional in his early 30s with such a case. He
correctly recognized that pedigree is still important, and after graduating from a top-
level University joined a top tier trading house, where he performed exceptionally well
for five years. His intention was always to leverage this and then boost his career in a
global environment. After making a move to a global firm and gaining a wider
experience in a smaller organization, we helped him land a position of much higher
responsibility with a more attractive global firm that offers a wide range of
opportunities.

In contrast to Japan from a few years ago, domestic employers are now placing
stronger emphasis on an employee's business experience and results, rather than their
academic record or ‘pedigree’. We have noted multiple cases of Japanese
professionals, with an average academic record and with a first company of lower
status, moving into larger and more attractive firms based on their work experience.

An interesting illustration is Japan’s two resume formats. The rirekishou is simply a list
of every educational institution and company someone has been enrolled in and for

21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

how long; the shokumou keirekishou lists responsibilities, achievements etc., much
like a resume used in the West. The latter is gaining popularity and relevance, while
firms that place high importance on the former likely still communicate by fax and
employ a small army of office ladies to serve tea….


Moving toward or away?
As a word of advice for companies looking to hire talent from established, high-status
Japanese companies – understand the motivation. Are you talking to someone who is
interested in your business for the right reasons? Do they buy into your values,
mission, the potential of your business, your technology, or do they face some sort of
trouble, a demotion, or a glass ceiling in their current firm?

Also, be careful not to confuse pedigree with results. Graduating from a top tier
university and gaining employment in a prestigious firm is valuable much in the same
way an IQ test is. Both show a candidate’s potential. The world has plenty of
underperforming geniuses; we need to look beyond potential and see what each
person has done with the gifts they’ve been given.

GLOBAL      VIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Brazil/ Solar power
The European Investment Bank granted a €200 million loan to Sicredi, a cooperative
financial institution, for investments in solar energy. Sicredi will use the funds to install
solar PV panels in homes, small and medium businesses and rural properties.

California/ Energy transition
The California Energy Commission approved a goal to make available up to 7 GW of
electricity through smarter use of existing clean energy resources. This will mostly be a
load-shifting goal to encourage customers to shift electricity use to cheaper and
cleaner times of the day. The state plans to have 38 GW of clean energy by 2030.

Chile/ Battery storage
On top of 5 GWh already sought for 2027-28, The govt plans to invest an additional
$2 billion in large-scale energy storage systems by 2026. Chile is one of the world’s
leading renewable energy producers.
EU/ Gas futures
In a sign that LNG markets are tightening with potentially stronger Asian demand, the
benchmark month-ahead Dutch TTF natural gas futures settled 20% higher at €28.48/
MWh. Last week it had hit the lowest level in two years. The UK benchmark equivalent
soared by 22%.

France/ Electricity
EVs and other technology to cut emissions will drive a surge in French power demand
by 2035; thus, France must maintain its nuclear capacity, said grid operator RTE.
Annual electricity use is likely to rise by 10 TWh on average over the next decade, to
between 580 and 640 TWh in 2035. That compares with 453 TWh in 2022.

India/ Battery storage
Companies will be offered $455 million in incentives to set up battery storage projects
totaling 4 GWh. The plan seeks to boost battery projects that will be crucial to India's
goal to grow renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030.

Indonesia/ LNG
State-owned energy firm Pertamina is leading a group of investors to acquire Shell's
35% stake in the country's Masela gas project, which will have annual LNG production
of 9.5 million tons at its peak.

Kazakhstan/ Oil and gas
The govt seeks $16.5 billion in damages from international oil companies over
disputed project costs and won’t settle out-of-court, said Energy Minister Almasadam
Satkaliyev. The dispute involves companies developing the Kashagan and
Karachaganak oil fields where costs were deducted as part of profit-sharing deals.

Mexico/ Critical minerals
The mining body Camimex warned that changes in the mining code could endanger
$9 billions of investment and stall development of metals that are crucial for the
energy transition. This will complicate obtaining mineral concessions, possibly inciting
litigation by Canadians that control nearly 70% of foreign-owned mining companies in
Mexico.

UK/ Energy transition
The state energy regulator will be legally required to push towards net zero carbon
emissions. The govt introduced an amendment to the “energy bill” updating Ofgem’s
remit to reflect the UK’s legally binding 2050 net zero target that was introduced in
2019.
