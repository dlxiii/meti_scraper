NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







METI outlines six action plans to push CCS
(Japan NRG, Jan. 26)
•  METI outlined six programs to make carbon capture and storage (CCS) operational in Japan by
2030: 1) government support to CCS operators; 2) measures to reduce CCS costs; 3) fostering
public understanding of CCS; 4) expansion overseas with JOGMEC’s support; 5) enacting a CCS
Business Act; and 6) writing and revising a CCS action plan.
•  The national goal for 2030 is to secure 6-12 million tons of carbon storage space.

•  METI aims to build a regulatory framework, as soon as possible, starting with the enactment of the
“CCS Business Act” that defines carbon collection, transport and storage operators, their liabilities,
regulatory processes, and etc.
•  CONTEXT: Japan promised to phase out low-efficient coal power plants, but USC and IGCC
thermal power technology will continue to operate, emitting 700-800 kg of CO2/kWh. Along with
ammonia/hydrogen co-firing, CCS is a means to reduce emissions from fossil fuel power.

• TAKEAWAY: Carbon will be defined as “material with value”, not industrial waste. Entities will be able to claim
ownership of it. Like offshore wind, METI will set “CCS zones”. Storage operators will face more regulatory
scrutiny compared to carbon collection and transport operators, and non-Japanese companies can’t be
storage operators. Japan also needs more studies on carbon leakage’s impact on marine environment is
required.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
At least three Japanese groups aim for carbon storage business by 2030
(Nikkei, Jan. 25)
o  At least three Japanese groups are looking to set up carbon capture as a commercial
business by 2030
o  During this fiscal year, METI will choose between three and five CCS projects to support.

o  Among the firms hoping to make a business in this field are:
!  Group 1: Itochu, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, INPEX, Taisei Corp
!  Group 2: Idemitsu, Hokkaido Electric, JAPEX

!  Group 3: ENEOS, J Power, and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration
o  CONTEXT: One billion kWh of coal-fired generation a year emits close to 1 million tons
of CO2.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
“K” LINE and KEPCO sign MoU to develop CCS value chain
(Company statement, Jan. 19)
o  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (“K” LINE) signed a MoU to study marine transportation and

shipping costs of liquefied CO2 emitted from Kansai Electric to develop a CO2 capture &
storage (CCS) value chain.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  “K” LINE has experience in the Northern Lights project in Norway; the two companies
will investigate how to transport liquefied CO2 long-distance and at large scale, and have
more flexibility in the CCS value chain.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mitsui and Kansai Electric agree to study CCS value chain development

(Company statement, Jan. 18)
o  Trading house Mitsui and Kansai Electric signed an MoU for a feasibility study on carbon
capture and storage (CCS) value chain development.
o  Kansai Electric will study the potential to capture CO2 at its thermal power plants and
Mitsui will look at ways to transport and store the emissions.
o  Mitsui wants to handle 15 million tons of CCS capacity by 2035.
• TAKEAWAY: The tie-up likely relates to the carbon capture project that Kansai Electric plans around its 1.8 GW

Maizuru coal-fired power plant in Kyoto. The utility is already working with Japan CCS Corp. to create a
liquified CO2 shipping terminal at the Maizuru complex that will ship 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions from the
coal plant in liquid form for storage at the Tomakomai hub in Hokkaido. The demo phase is due to complete in
2027. CO2 transport is due to start in 2024 using a custom built large liquified CO2 carrier, operated by Mitsui
OSK Lines (MOL).



Nippon Steel to export CO2 to the U.S.
(Nikkei, Jan. 18)
•  Nippon Steel, Exxon Mobil, and Mitsubishi signed a MoU to collaborate on a project to capture
CO2 produced by Japanese steel furnaces for transport offshore and storage in depleted gas

fields and other underground repositories.
•  Captured CO2 will be sent to Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
•  Mitsubishi will organize the transportation in dedicated tankers. The start date of the project is as
yet undetermined.
•  CONTEXT: The steel industry is responsible for over 10% of Japan’s total carbon emissions.
Nippon Steel needs to cut its CO2 emissions by 30% this decade compared to 2013 levels.




Tokyo Gas invests in U.S. direct air capture (DAC) venture
(Company statement, Jan. 19)
•  Tokyo Gas became the first Japanese energy company to invest in and conclude an agreement
with Global Thermostat, a U.S.-based developer of Direct Air Capture (DAC).
•  For the last decade, Global Thermostat has been developing tech to create e-fuel; the project is

supported by the U.S. Department of Energy.
•  Tokyo Gas will deploy Global Thermostat’s DAC system in Japan to test its operation. The gas
company hopes to develop new businesses by utilizing CO2 captured by DAC for methanation,
CCUS and other applications within Japan and abroad

Lawmakers urged to bolster domestic biofuel production
(Japan NRG, Jan. 24)
•  Japan NRG attended the Biofuel Study Session hosted by the Parliamentary Group to Promote
Carbon Neutrality with Domestic Biofuel and Synthetic Fuel that was held at the Diet Members'

Building on Jan 24.
•  Professor Imou Kenji of Tokyo University said that while there is 3.6 GW of power biomass
generation capacity in Japan, 69% uses imported biomass fuel. Biomass used for domestic
transportation depends almost 100% on imported biomass fuel.
•  Professor Imou advised that while the supply of domestic biomass fuel is far less than required to
achieve carbon neutrality, the production of domestic biomass would benefit the local economy.

Domestic biomass should not only be valued for GHG reduction.
•  Professor Shigeo Satokawa of Seikei University talked about technology development cases of
synthetic fuel, including DAC (Direct Air Capture) by Carbon Engineering (U.S.); the Haru Oni
Project that produces gasoline from hydrogen and CO2; and, projects by Mitsui Chemicals and
Iceland company Carbon Recycling International (CRI) to produce methanol synthesis from CO2.
• TAKEAWAY: EVs attract the most attention as a green transportation solution, but many in Japan would like to
explore other decarbonized fuel options, believing that electrification is not the only future solution.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Agriculture Ministry selects four more towns to be biomass industry hubs
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 25)
o  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), along with seven other

ministries and agencies involved in biomass, selected four new towns to become
Biomass Industrial Cities. They are: Hamanaka Town, Hokkaido; Naganohara Town,
Gunma Prefecture; Ryuoh Town, Shiga Prefecture; and Sera Town, Hiroshima Prefecture.
o  Biomass Industrial Cities aim to create climate friendly and resilient areas centered on
biomass; to use the local environment and economy to build profitable and integrated
supply chains from raw materials to collection, transportation, manufacturing, and use.
o  The number of biomass industry hubs is now 101.




Euglena, Marui Group, and Rohto Pharmaceutical tie up for supply of biofuels
(Kankyo Business, Jan. 23)
•  Euglena plans a new business collaboration with its two new partners in the field of healthcare and
energy using microalgae “Euglena.”
•  With its main business in retail, fintech, and future investment, Marui Group will support sales &

marketing, e-commerce and distribution of Euglena’s biofuels.
•  Rohto Pharma has been known for its eye-care, skincare, and other medical drugs, and it plans to
adapt “Euglena” into their pharma and cosmetic products.
• TAKEAWAY: Euglena is making inroads into some short-term government contracts for public transport. It
recently won a contract to supply its next-generation biofuel, Susteo, to 58 buses owned by Tokyo City’s
Kotakibashi Automobile Office for one month. It has also tried Susteo fuel in ferries, airplanes, and agricultural
machinery.

Toyota Motors debuts both EV and FCEV at Tokyo Auto Salon 2023

(Kankyo Business, Jan. 23)
•  Tokyo Auto Salon 2023 was held at Makuhari Messe (Jan 13-15) in Chiba Prefecture; Toyota
Motors presented two new models with a body based on mass produced cars sold in the 1980s.
•  One model replaced an IC engine and transmission with motors, inverters, and batteries – “EV
conversion.” The other remodeled the original engine into a hydrogen engine. Both were popular
in the 1980s for their sporty-design and high speed, and the new models retain the same

characteristics.
•  CONTEXT: Toyota is Japan’s only automaker developing both battery-EVs and hydrogen fuel-cell
EVs. Now that Toyota has released these new “makeover” models, EV- or hydrogen-conversion
may become a trend in the auto industry.



Tokyo Gas says it made world’s first aluminum profiles using hydrogen

(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 25)
•  Tokyo Gas said it succeeded in manufacturing aluminum profiles, which are used to make
aluminum sashes, using heat fueled by hydrogen.
•  The test was conducted at an aluminum profile manufacturing facility in Maebashi City owned by
LIXIL. There were no problems with the product quality.
•  For the manufacturing process, natural gas used for combustion in heat treatment was replaced

with hydrogen.


Honda, GS Yuasa to launch EV battery JV
(Nikkei Asia, Jan. 23)
•  Honda Motor will establish a JV with GS Yuasa, a leading Japanese battery maker, to develop EV
batteries to tap the growing EV market, as it moves to end gasoline car sales. Honda aims to sell

only EV or FCEV by 2040.

•  The new company will be established by late 2023 and cover product development and a wide
range of EV battery-related operations, including the planning of sales channels.
•  GS Yuasa set up a dedicated department for EV batteries and aims to gain “know-how on
installing battery cells in EVs” through this tie-up.
•  CONTEXT: Honda already has a plan to source batteries from Envision AESC Group for models

going on sale in 2024. The new JV covers battery supply for 2025 and beyond. Mass-production of
its batteries with South Korea’s LG Energy Solutions will start in the U.S. in 2025. Honda will also
purchase batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology through 2030.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Honda and LG Energy Solutions create JV for Li-ion EV batteries
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 23)

o  Honda and LG Energy Solutions set up a JV in Ohio, U.S. to produce lithium-ion batteries
for EVs. Plant construction is expected to be completed by late 2024.
o  Mass production will begin by late 2025, and will go to Honda's North American plant.
Production capacity is expected at 40 GWh per year.
o  The new company is L-H Battery Company. Honda has a 49% stake and LG the rest.



Sumitomo Heavy and Hiroshima Gas to test liquid-air energy storage technology
(Company Statement, Jan. 18)
•  Sumitomo Heavy will partner with Hiroshima Gas to build a Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES)
demonstration plant near the Hatsukaichi LNG Terminal in Hiroshima Prefecture. The tech is
licensed from Highview Enterprise Ltd., a U.K. developer.
•  CONTEXT: Liquid air storage uses temperature differences as a means to store electricity. Air is

cooled until it turns into a liquid, which can be stored in a tank. Later, the liquid can be returned to
gaseous state using waste heat from an industrial process, for example. The gas is then used to
turn a turbine to generate electricity.
•  The project developers say this will be a “commercial” level demonstration plant. They will use the
nearby LNG plant for cooling.
•  The LAES plant will operate in the wholesale power and capacity markets.




Japan joins Coalition of Trade Ministers on Climate
(Government statement, Jan. 20)
•  Japan joined the Coalition of Trade Ministers on Climate that was inaugurated on Jan. 19 at the
World Economic Forum in Davos.
•  The Coalition, together with 27 ministers, aims for cooperation on climate-friendly trade policies
and to support climate adaptations by developing economies.
•  The METI minister stressed the need to avoid extreme climate-related trade barriers and to

synchronize regulations to facilitate transactions from production to consumption.
•  CONTEXT: The WTO has several committees to discuss trade and sustainability issues, while the
Paris Agreement does not address trade issues at all. The Coalition of ministers aims to drive high-
level political dialog while aligning with WTO and Paris Agreement objectives.
• TAKEAWAY: The METI minister’s remarks reflected Japan’s proposal to the WTO in March 2021 on achieving
global carbon neutrality.

Sumitomo Mitsui makes ¥30 billion in sustainability-linked loans
(New Energy Business News, Jan. 27)
•  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank concluded a series of syndicated sustainability-linked loans totaling
¥30 billion. Borrowers are e-commerce major Z Holdings and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Panasonic

Finance Co.
•  For Z Holding, in addition to Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, the lenders include Mizuho Bank,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, and Credit Agricole Bank.
•  The retail giant aims to convert more than 80% of the electricity used by the group's major
companies to renewable energy by around FY2025, and expand that to 100% within five years
after that.
•  CONTEXT: A sustainability-linked loan comes with KPIs and "Sustainability Performance Targets

(SPTs)" defined in the borrower's management strategy. Loan terms depend on the borrower's
SPTs performance. The aim is to promote environmentally and sustainable business.



Researchers develop super-strong carbon negative concrete

(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Jan. 25)
•  University of Tokyo researchers developed a carbon negative concrete blend that has a
compressive strength three times greater than that required by Japan’s building code.
•  To produce the concrete, the team reacted CO2 with carbonated mortar to create calcium
hydrogen carbonate, which was then heated to separate out calcium carbonate. The resulting
material was then repeatedly exposed to pressure, wetting, and drying to achieve the desired
hardness.
•  The process enables over 50 times more CO2 than usual to be captured.




Sumitomo Mitsui Trust ties up with a U.S. investor on decarbonization fund
(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 26)
•  U.S. firm Energy Capital Partners will work with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank to launch a
multibillion-dollar fund in 2024 for Japanese decarbonization.
•  The fund will target renewable energy facilities and firms that can take the lead in decarbonization,

such as battery makers and renewable fuel producers.
•  Energy Capital has $16 billion under management, and will raise funds from institutional investors
in Japan and overseas, coordinating with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust.



ANA and JAL will be fueled with SAF from Raven SR

(Various, Jan. 18)
•  All Nippon Airways (ANA) signed an MoU for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from Raven SR Inc for
major global routes. In 2025, an initial 50,000 tons of SAF will be supplied; that will increase to
200,000 tons by 2035.
•  Similarly, Japan Airlines (JAL) signed a MoU with Raven SR for supply of 50,000 tons of SAF in
2025 and 200,000 tons by 2035.

•  CONTEXT: The two major Japanese airlines decided to take a big step towards net zero CO2 by
2050, as required by the Civil Aviation Organization. The rest of Japan’s airlines will follow.



TEPCO: contamination leads to delay in removal of remaining Unit 6 nuclear fuel

(Kyodo, Jan. 26)
•  TEPCO said the removal of nuclear fuel from unit 5 will be delayed by one year, from the end of
FY2023 to 1H of FY2025, due to contamination of shared pool storage for fuel removal from all
nuclear reactors.
•  The storage was contaminated by rust or calcium carbonate. In the future, to prevent
contamination TEPCO will cleanse the nuclear fuel before pouring it into storage.
•  Only Fukushima’s units 3 and 4 completed nuclear fuel removal. However, TEPCO plans to finish

removal for all 6 units by 2031, to prepare for major earthquakes or tsunamis.
• TAKEAWAY: Under this plan, TEPCO needs 20 years to remove unused fuel. Since one of the most difficult
tasks is the retrieval of used fuel and debris, much time is required to finish decommissioning. TEPCO already
finished removal of used nuclear fuel from unit 3 (566 storage tanks) and unit 4 (1535 tanks), but removal is still
needed for unit 1 (615 tanks), unit 5 (1,542 tanks), and unit 6 (1,654 tanks).



Prosecutor appeals to Supreme Court over TEPCO officials’ acquittal
(Fukushima Broadcasting, Jan. 24)
•  The prosecutor appealed to the Supreme Court over the Tokyo High Court's acquittal of former

TEPCO executives who were charged in the Fukushima NPP accident.
•  Former TEPCO Chairman Katsumata and three other former execs were charged with
manslaughter in the deaths of 44 people during the accident.
•  In making its acquittal on Jan 18, the Tokyo High Court rejected the reliability of the government’s
"long-term assessment" of tsunami earthquake predictions.
• TAKEAWAY: While a number of people were reported to have died from reasons related to the Fukushima
accident, no person died directly from it. Therefore, the lawsuit claimed that “TEPCO killed 44 people because

they did not stop the operation of the nuclear power plant to prevent the tsunami”, but this logic didn’t make
sense to the Tokyo High Court twice in fact. While a section of the population would be happy to see TEPCO
execs held responsible for the events in 2011, the prosecutor’s line of argument has had little traction so far.
The Supreme Court is the last injunction.



Analysts warn transition to ammonia/hydrogen energy not realistic for Japan
(Japan NRG, Jan. 25)
•  Michael Liebreich of Liebreich Associates and Takizawa Hajime of the Institute for Global
Environmental Studies (IGES) in Kanagawa warned that Japan’s shift to ammonia and hydrogen

energy is unrealistic due to costs, limited supplies and lack of technologies.
•  Takizawa said Japan will vacuum up global ammonia supplies as its 2030 demand is predicted at 3
million tons compared to a global supply level of 20 million tons.
•  Importing ammonia and hydrogen will be expensive as the molecules require large space, and
energy is lost during conversion, said Liebreich.

•  Cost of 20% coal-ammonia co-firing would be ¥12.9/kWh; at 100% ammonia power generation this
rises to ¥23.5/kWh; coal burning is ¥10.4/kWh, said Takizawa.
•  CONTEXT: Liebreich and Takizawa were speaking at the “Possibilities and Risks of Hydrogen”
webinar hosted by IGES and the Japan Climate Leadership Partnership.
• TAKEAWAY: METI proposes to subsidize hydrogen and ammonia for the next decade or so, to make them

affordable. The scope of state funding is likely to expand to non-green hydrogen. Takizawa said his studies
show that power generated from 100% gray ammonia releases more carbon than combined cycle gas turbines.

OCCTO  releases power system master plan: ¥7 trillion needed to decarbonize the grid
(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 26)
•  OCCTO released a draft of its “Power System Master Plan for 2050 Japan”, which estimates ¥6 to
¥7 trillion of investment in power systems is needed to realize decarbonize the grid.
•  OCCTO estimated that high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines should be built in

east Japan to secure more power transmission for renewable energy. It’s forecast that 6 GW
capacity of HVDC transmission lines between Hokkaido and Tohoku, and 8 GW between Tohoku
and Tokyo will be needed. Also, 2.8 GW is needed between Chugoku and Kyushu.
•  The connection between East Japan (50 Hz) and West Japan (60 Hz) is currently planned as 3 GW
capacity, but the plan recommends to add another 2.7 GW.
• TAKEAWAY: As most high voltage transmission lines were built during the high economic growth period of

1955 to 1973, the majority of those are already aging. Therefore, it’s very important to take advantage of the
GX national program to replace the power lines.



METI conducts on-site inspection at Kansai Electric due to compliance breaches
(Japan NRG, Jan. 26)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission – the METI committee that oversees the
electricity and gas market – conducted an on-site inspection of KEPCO’s offices over revelations
that the utility’s employees accessed confidential data on competitors’ subscribers.
•  This is the first time since its establishment in 2015 that the commission has raided a utility in

relation to an individual incident.
•  The commission is considering asking METI to take disciplinary action against the utility. This could
come in the form of a business improvement order.
•  Leaks of customer data were also discovered at Tohoku Electric, Kyushu Electric, and Shikoku
Electric.
•  CONTEXT: From September to December of last year, 730 Kansai Electric employees gained
illegal computer access to up to 14,657 data points. The METI commission was established in

2015, but this is the first case of an on-site inspection.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Minister orders emergency audit of all retailers and grid firms over compliance breach
(NHK, Jan. 23)
o  METI Minister Nishimura says recent compliance breaches by KEPCO, Tohoku Electric,
Kyushu Electric, and Shikoku Electric were very unfortunate and could threaten fair
competition.

o  METI ordered an emergency audit of all electricity retailers and transmission service
providers to identify any similar conduct.
o  The utilities admitted to improperly accessing information on competitors’ subscribers.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: Major utilities have spun off their transmission and distribution (T&D) assets since the industry was
liberalized in 2016. However, these assets are still part of the same holding or group structure as the utility’s
generation business. Meanwhile, the T&D companies are regional monopolies in their own right, handling
customer information also for new market entrants. This makes the data leaks a very serious issue and brings
into question the sincerity of the market liberalization. That’s a key reason why the regulator must act tough.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Series of scandals raises questions about electricity industry
(Nikkei Energy Next, Jan. 19)
o  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by the Nikkei editorial board.

o  Recent revelations of collusion and improper accessing of confidential customer data
raise questions about oversight in Japan’s electricity sector.
o  Historically, the METI committee that oversees the electricity and gas market has taken a
back seat on compliance matters. One senses that the committee is mocked by utilities.
o  Japan should look to Europe and the U.S. for solutions. In Europe, for example, the
industry is governed by REMIT (the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and
Transparency), which allows fair competition to be policed more comprehensively.

o  In Japan fairness has been neglected. The country’s insular culture might be to blame.
o  Regulators need to proactively monitor the industry.



IPP share of retail power sales falls to 19.5%
(Japan NRG, Jan. 25)
•  Independent power providers had a 19.5% share of the power retail market as of September 2022,

down from 19.9% in June. IPP’s share in the low voltage market, mainly for households, was up to
26.8% compared to 25.7% in June.


Miyagi Prefecture considers tax on solar developments in forest areas

(NHK News Web, Jan. 19)
•  The Miyagi government is considering a 30-40% tax on operating profit for a developer building a
renewable energy facility that would destroy local forests.
•  Developers have canceled several projects because of public opposition over fear of deforestation
and other environmental issues. This new tax plan may encourage developers to use flat lands,
rather than reclaiming forests.
•  The govt agreed to levy a tax, but the rate needs to be discussed. The new rule will be submitted
by June, and the new tax plan will be ready by 2024.




7 EPCOs to raise electricity price up to 40%; TEPCO plans for restart of Kashiwazaki NPP
(Kyodo, Jan. 26)
•  Seven EPCOs applied to METI to raise power retail prices by 30 to 40%. Tohoku, Hokuriku,
Chugoku, Shikoku and Okinawa want to raise the price from April 2023; Hokkaido and Tokyo
would raise from June 2023.

•  Power companies are suffering from fuel price hikes.
•  TEPCO said the revised power retail price is on the presumption that unit 7 and unit 6 of its
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP restarts in October 2023 and April 2025, respectively.
• TAKEAWAY: The NRA virtually stopped operation at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa over recent incidents of TEPCO staff
misconduct. Thus, it won't be easy for TEPCO to get approval for the restart of unit 7 in October 2023.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO rate increase means despite subsidies the bill is going up
(TBS News Dig, Jan. 23)
o  TEPCO applied for government permission to raise rates 29.3% on a plan used by over

half of its subscribers, starting July.
o  CEO Kobayagawa says the utility was forced to make a difficult decision.
o  While the government’s new subsidy will see the average power bill fall by ¥1,800 from
February, the rate hike means that bills will rise again in July by an average of ¥2,600. In
other words, consumers will face a net increase of ¥800.

TEPCO to post a record loss of ¥50.2 million

(Jiji, Jan. 23)
o  TEPCO HD expects a loss of ¥50.2 million for FY2022, its biggest ever.
o  The main factors are rising cost of fuel and the weakening yen.


IT firms including Applied Materials of U.S. to sponsor upgrades of Japanese hydro plants

(New Energy Business News, Jan. 27)
•  Chubu Electric agreed with a group of six global companies, including Applied Materials and
Micron Technology, a semiconductor manufacturer, to finance renovation of existing hydropower
plants to expand capacity.
•  Global manufacturers seek to increase the amount of electricity they consume from renewable

•  In the agreement with Chubu, customers can participate from the planning stage in the renovation
of the utility’s existing non-FIT hydropower plants. In return, they purchase power generated from

the added renewables capacity.
•  As the first project, the consortium plans to sponsor the refurbishment of aged facilities at the
Oigawa Hydroelectric Power Station Unit 1 in Shizuoka Prefecture, which should boost its capacity
by 1.9 GWh a year starting April 2025.


Run rates of oil-fired power plants rise on high LNG prices

(Japan NRG, Jan. 25)
•  Run rates of oil-fired power plants rose in August last year to generate over 2 tWh, which is unusual
as demand starts to peak off.
•  The cost of oil was 6.91 U.S. cents/1,000 Kcal in August, lower than LNG’s cost of 7.09 cents/1,000
Kcal, triggering the switch from LNG to oil.
•  Meanwhile, import cost spreads among oil, LNG and crude oil are narrowing, possibly reducing

run rates of coal power plants.

Russia's Sakhalin-2 project might double LNG revenue
(Reuters, Jan. 25)
•  Russia's Sakhalin-2 LNG project could double revenue and profit in 2023, versus 2021 levels,
thanks to higher prices, and long-term deals with Asian buyers.
•  Renewed deals with Asian buyers could secure demand for 6.5 million tons of LNG annually from
Sakhalin-2.

•  That could generate $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion in revenue for Sakhalin-2 this year, according to
Rystad Energy. The project could earn another $7.45 billion this year if it keeps production in line
with 2022 and sells 4.9 million tons of LNG on the spot market.
•  In 2021, Sakhalin-2's revenue was $5.7 billion and net profit was $2 billion.
• TAKEAWAY: Japanese shareholders Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp hold a combined 22.5% stake; Gazprom
has a 50% stake. Last week, Osaka Gas renewed its deal to buy gas from Sakhalin-2, taking 200,000 tons of

LNG annually, or about 2% of output. Hiroshima Gas, JERA, Kyushu Electric, Saibu Gas, Toho Gas, Tohoku
Electric and Tokyo Gas have also renewed deals.

ANALYSIS

BY ANDREW DEWIT
PROFESSOR OF ENERGY POLICY
SCHOOL OF ECEONOMIC POLICY STUDIES
RIKKYO UNIVERSITY, TOKYO
Japan Signals Smart Money Should Move to Smart Cities
To Promote Carbon Neutrality Initiatives

Prime Minister Kishida has pronounced Digital and Green transformations as the two
X factors of his government policy. The locus where DX and GX meet is the “smart
city” concept. And the number of Japanese regions opening their doors to smart city
planning is starting to balloon.

More than one in 10 local governments have signed up to the most important
initiative in this space, the Smart City Public-Private Collaborative Platform. That
bodes well for the nationwide volume of projects in clean energy, as well as ICT, and
strongly suggests that increasing volumes of public money will flow to support the
trend. In 2022, budget allocations for smart city initiatives grew about 10% beyond
initial estimates.

As concern about the Covid pandemic subsides in both Japan and overseas, there’s
reemerging interest in improving urban and industrial infrastructure as a way to tackle
climate, energy, and supply chain issues. Recent surveys report hundreds of smart city
projects globally, with investments worth over $500 billion in the present and likely
exceeding $1 trillion by 2027. Some bulls even pronounce that the sector’s market
size will hit $7 trillion by 2030.

Of course, what a “smart” city entails – as was the case before the pandemic –
remains fluid. The definition has become even more elusive in the net-zero age,
through a plethora of new permutations such as “sustainable smart cities,” “smart
green cities,” and “smart digital cities.” Kishida recently added his own Vision for a
Digital Garden City Nation to the mix.

Whatever the title, this is a topic that’s exciting both national and local governments
in Japan, a rare feat. It’s also winning support from industry.


One smart city initiative to rule them all
In a smart city, the ICT element feeds into everything from energy to mobility to
environmental solutions. Assessing such a comprehensive approach naturally risks
overegging, by implicitly defining everything in the city as smart.

Luckily, Japanese surveys afford a little more precision for measuring the scale of
smart cities and the scope of institutional involvement. Toyota’s Woven City gets the
most international press, with Toyota and NTT using it as a platform for global
connected cars and other deployments. But Japan’s most important initiative is
probably its Smart City Public-Private Collaborative Platform, whose diverse
membership is itemized in table 1. Of particular note is the growing number of local
governments: 187 as of December 2022, or just under 11% of Japan’s 1,765
prefectures, cities and other local governments. Tokyo, Yokohama, and 17 other


19

influential, trend-setting prefectures are official members, together with their large
cities such as Yokohama, Sapporo, Fukuoka, and Sendai.

A further 57 local governments – including 9 prefectures - are in the observer
category, meaning they have a strong interest in pursuing smart city approaches. And
they are doing this in concert with strong representation from civil society.

Table 1: Japan’s Smart City Public-Private Collaborative Platform (as of December 26, 2022)

Total Membership                  928

The platform’s official members include 13 energy-related firms, such as TEPCO and
the other major power utilities, plus Tokyo Gas and ENEOS. Japan’s communications,
real estate, construction, mobility, finance, and other sectors are also well-
represented.

The Smart City Public-Private Collaborative Platform was inaugurated in June of 2019.
It’s one of several recently developed public-private platforms, including venues for
pursuing such initiatives as SDGs, decarbonized rail transport, and green
infrastructure. All of these collaborations address decarbonization, but in a context
where other amenities are stressed. That enhances local interests’ willingness to go
along with the deregulation and private-finance initiatives that also animate the
deliberations


More money, more EMS
Since April of 2021, the Cabinet Office has committed to pursuing a range of smart
city, super city, and digital garden city developments in at least 100 local areas by
2025. In July last year, the Cabinet Office’s Council for Science, Technology and
Innovation announced that 51 local areas and 54 projects had been selected.

State funds have followed. Items related to smart cities totaled about ¥94 billion in the
initial FY2022 government budget, according to Nikkei BP Research, but expanded
beyond ¥100 billion as the year unfolded to reflect national concerns about cyber-
security and other digital issues.

The trend of more funding for smart cities is set to continue into the upcoming fiscal
year that starts in April. MoE alone aims to spend 13% more on smart city programs
than it did this fiscal year, according to Japan’s Smart City News service analysis of
ministry budgetary requests. Within that increase is an even faster increase in funds for
renewable energy projects.

Renewable energy generation won’t be the only direct beneficially of smart city
funding. One area highlighted in last year’s survey by the Yano Economic Research
Institute is the dissemination of smart-grid community energy management systems

(EMS). Yano calculated that domestic spending on EMS will nearly triple in the course
of this decade. The forecast is supported by other Japanese market research on smart
houses and related items.

In a way, the emphasis on EMS makes a lot of sense. Such systems were the core
element of government smart city programs in the early 2010s in Kitakyushu,
Keihanna Science City (Kyoto), Yokohama, and Toyota. They are also seen as ticking
several boxes and allow for smoother official funding approval.

Among the companies that stand to benefit will be not only the communications firms
but major domestic engineering conglomerates such as Toshiba and Hitachi. The
latter boasts a number of different EMS options that can integrate centralized nuclear,
hydro and thermal power with distributed renewable generation such as solar and
wind generation, as well as battery storage.











Source: Hitachi Energy Management Systems

EMS can be set up for factories, individual buildings, EVs, and other circumstances.
These systems provide advanced monitoring of power supply and demand, allowing
for enhanced efficiencies through such measures as identifying and cutting peak
demand.

Pushing more SMEs to consider energy efficiency measures, METI has set up a
dedicated subsidy mechanism that covers up to half of the business cost of installing
EMS for a smaller firm. The subsidy for large firms covers up to a third of the cost.

A niche that’s almost guaranteed a boom, however, are home energy management
systems (HEMS). The government has set a target to install HEMS in every home by
2030. What’s more, many local governments are already subsidizing them.

COLUMN:        ENERGY      JOBS    IN  JAPAN

2022 Energy Talent Trends - A Year of Transition

Last year was very interesting and eventful for the energy industry. The highlights
include Japan’s fundamental shift in nuclear policy, the war in Ukraine, LNG shortages
and record energy prices, a pause on Japan’s offshore wind auctions after a shock
Round 1 result, as well as a major spotlight on co-firing with hydrogen and ammonia.

Now, let’s take a look at what effects these events had on the talent market here in
Japan.


Continued growth in renewables
The renewables sector as a whole continued to grow. Though markets such as PV
solar saw some consolidation, demand for talent was driven by growth in energy
storage, EV charging infrastructure and wind power. As has been the case for the last
10 years in Japan, demand for quality talent outstripped supply, leading to greater
than 30% of all job changes within renewables involving people joining from other
sectors. The biggest ‘transfer’ areas were:


Engineering
Electrical engineering skills remain in high demand due to bottlenecks in grid
connection, as well as a trend for higher-volume, smaller capacity power plants.
Increasing realization within the industry about the need for quality asset management
and operations & maintenance (O&M) was also a catalyst for rising demand. We’ve
seen people from telecommunications, railways and power utilities moving into this
area.

Structural and mechanical engineering talent was also in high demand for wind power,
especially as for those with marine engineering experience. There was a clear need for
people with experience in shipping or floating facilities in the oil & gas exploration
space to move into offshore wind projects.


PV to ESS shift
What do PV and energy storage have in common? A need to acquire land, work with
local stakeholders, get permits, grid connections and prove a strong investment case
for the people who control the money. As the PV market becomes more competitive
and margins shrink, talent with a strong track record in this market shifted to
developing ESS projects. This set off both internal job switches and moves to a new
company.


Finance
Project finance professionals with general infrastructure experience, such as airports,
highways and hospitals, are getting tapped to work in renewables at an increasing
rate. That’s because the size, complexity, risk and capital requirements of renewable
energy projects are increasing. Those with corporate M&A experience are also seeing

22


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

increased interest from energy chiefs.

More traditional and private equity investors are launching sustainability and
infrastructure funds. This is partly due to consolidation in the PV market, driving a
trend for investors to target acquisition of portfolios or equity investments into
successful developers, rather than taking an asset-focused greenfield approach that
was predominant under the high FIT schemes of old.


Offshore wind: We need a strategy!
Following the shock Round 1 result with Mitsubishi Corporation-led consortiums
winning all three auctions in late December 2021, many in the industry were furious.
Whereas previously there was a heavy focus on local stakeholder management and
development work, industry players noted that local engagement scores would not be
sufficient for success in future rounds. In addition to this, METI paused Round 2
auctions to review the criteria, and industry players were keen to lobby and influence
the direction of these changes to suit their strengths.

As a result, we saw a heavy demand for strategic positions in Regulatory/Government
Affairs, Bid Management and Strategy, and Partnership Strategy that were not heavily
apparent in 2021. Those with prior experience in the public sector (especially ex
METI/ANRE officials), as well as strategic consultants who had experience supporting
Round 1 bids, were in high demand from the developer side as industry players
looked to better position themselves for success in Rounds 2 and 3.


Mid-career hiring ramps up
Traditionally, large Japanese banks and trading houses primarily hired new graduates,
trained and rotated them around the business to become well-rounded employees.
But over the last few years, we’ve seen two changes that are pushing these big
industry players to increase mid-career hiring.

The first is an increased departure of top talent in middle-management levels. As
large foreign firms have increased investment into Japan and APAC markets, talent
from large banks and trading houses has topped the list for many new suitors. In the
early 2010s, most people did not leave their large employers until after 40 years old.
Now we’re seeing an increasing number of talented people jump ship in their late 20s
and early-mid 30s.

The second major reason is a shift in investment sectors, which has revealed a
shortage of talent in these niches. As the volume of deals in more traditional
infrastructure areas slow and less money flows into power / oil & gas, Japan Inc is
turning to decarbonization tech, such as CCS/CCUS and DAC, and digital tech, such
as VPP, ESS, and V2H systems. These areas lack experience people, so we’re seeing
more mid-career hiring there. Notable examples are the major trading houses
poaching talent from technology OEMs and major EPC players.


Outlook for 2023
Moving forward for 2023 we expect to see the above trends to accelerate. Though
there’s a huge resurgence in interest for nuclear power, and heavy public and industry
support for clean fuels and co-firing, on the talent side we see little impact. The

23


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

reason for this is that skills required in these areas already exist among the staff of
major market players.

LNG traders can easily shift to hydrogen and ammonia; investment talent in major
trading houses can be repurposed to find new partnerships; and the power utilities
and major manufacturers have retained a lot of talent in the nuclear sector. A trigger
point there, however, could be more serious progress in developing new nuclear tech
such as SMRs. That could throw an interesting curveball into the hiring market.

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Coal exports
Coal miners hope to benefit from a thaw in relations with China, as Xi Jinping seeks to
reboot the country’s economy. Whitehaven Coal said China’s relaxation of restrictions
on Australian coal imports is helping to drive prices to six-month highs.

Canada/ Renewable diesel
Imperial Oil will invest $720-million to build a renewable diesel facility at its refinery
near Edmonton that will produce 20,000 bpd of renewable diesel once completed in
2025. Renewable diesel is a biomass-based fuel that is chemically equivalent to
petroleum diesel.

Denmark/ Renewable energy
Local renewable power developer GreenGo Energy will lead a 60-billion Danish crown
($8.77 billion) project to develop a green energy park with 4 GW of solar and wind
energy.

India/ Adani Group
Shares in Adani Group’s companies fell 5% on average, shedding $10.8 billion in value
after short seller Hindenburg Research released a critical report about the group.
Deriving much of its revenues from mining and burning coal, Adani Group plans to
invest $70 billion by 2030 to become one of the world’s largest green energy businesses.

Iraq/ Oil
QatarEnergy is in talks to acquire an approximate 30% stake in TotalEnergies' $27
billion cluster of energy projects, as Baghdad hopes to counter Western energy
companies exiting the country as domestic turmoil increases.

Mexico/ Oil refinery
State oil company Pemex's newest refinery, which is still under construction in the
southeast, will begin to process crude oil in July. The refinery will first process 170,000
bpd of crude oil and eventually grow capacity to process 340,000 bpd.

Netherlands/ Natural gas
Europe’s largest gas field, Groningen, might be shut. Officials say it’s “very dangerous”
because of earthquakes. Still, the government will wait to see if there’s a shortage of
gas after the winter. About 100 tremors have been recorded annually in the area since
the 1980s.

UAE/ Commodities
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and energy trading house Gunvor extended an
exclusivity period for deal talks as they try to reach an agreement over a possible
investment. ADNOC might take a minority stake in Gunvor, whose net profit soared to
$841 million in 1H 2021.

UK/ Batteries
Recharge Industries, an Australian battery company, made a bid for UK battery
producer Britishvolt. The UK government offered Britishvolt £100 million in funding
before its collapse. Recharge said it will want to secure that money if it takes over.

U.S./ Biofuels
