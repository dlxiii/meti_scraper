NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


ANRE adds changes to requirements for 3rd round LTDA

(Government statement, June 23)
•  ANRE made several changes to requirements for the third round of the Long-term Decarbonized
Power Sources Auction (LTDA).
•  Eligible are retrofit projects that convert or adapt thermal power plants to co-fire hydrogen at a rate
of at least 10% or ammonia at a rate of at least 20%. Installing CCS at existing coal-fired or gas-fired
plants is also eligible for subsidies as long as it removes at least 20% of the total emissions. Projects
with biomass mono or co-firing can also bid.
•  Retrofit subsidy price caps:
o  Hydrogen co-firing: ¥762,865/kW/year (with a noted lower reference value of ¥312,955)
o  Ammonia co-firing: ¥378,807/kW/year (with a lower reference value of ¥79,243)
o  Coal plants installing CCS: ¥343,799/kW/year
o  LNG/gas plants installing CCS: ¥137,939/kW/year
o  Biomass: ¥100,000/kW/year
•  If a project fails to receive approval under the support scheme for low-carbon fuel supply, or if the
actual support is lower than the expected amount, such cases will be treated as force majeure and
will not be subject to market exit penalties.
•  For hydrogen and ammonia, the definition of exclusive firing will not be tightened; projects with a
co-firing ratio of 90% or more will be allowed to participate as exclusive (i.e. mono) firing projects.
•  Although around 90% of revenue earned from other markets must be returned, the scope will be
expanded to include revenue obtained through the use of equipment included in the bid price, in
addition to revenue from power generation and non-fossil value.
•  On bid price adjustments, automatic corrections will be made to reflect inflation and interest rate
fluctuations. However, for large-scale power sources that require long-term construction (period
exceeding 10 years) and high-level investment (several hundred billion yen) – whether for new
installations or ‘replacements’ – a mechanism will be set up to address the risk of cost increases
caused by regulatory or external factors.
•  CONTEXT: These updates for the LTDA 3rd round aim to promote investment in new power sources by
addressing the increase in construction costs caused by inflation, interest rate hikes, and currency
depreciation.
• TAKEAWAY: METI is positioning the LTDA as another mechanism to support hydrogen and ammonia, along
with the price difference support (CfD) scheme. To date, however, the LTDA has not been a big draw for utilities
interested in using those fuels. The first round resulted in a small number of successful bids – one project for
hydrogen co-firing (55 MW) and five projects for ammonia co-firing (770 MW) that will involve retrofitting
existing thermal plants. The second round yielded only one project for ammonia co-firing (95 MW), aso a
thermal station retrofit. The next round is raising the caps significantly to encourage more bids. Also, new

institutional measures will be introduced to mitigate investment recovery risks for large-scale projects, not
limited to hydrogen and ammonia.



Plans for methane-emissions data transparency across LNG value chain
(Government statement, June 20)
•  METI, MoE, JOGMEC and the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) made a statement
calling for collaboration and data transparency to reduce methane emissions across the LNG value
chain. The UN Environment Programme’s International Methane Emissions Observatory also joined.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The statement highlights Japan’s ongoing efforts through the CLEAN initiative. MoE and NIES are
contributing through the GOSAT satellite program that provides global GHG data, including
methane.
•  The collaboration includes four initiatives: 1) improving transparency through project-level methane
emissions data disclosure; 2) supporting publication of the CLEAN Annual Report with data from
IMEO; 3) validating methane detection technologies in Asia-Pacific LNG facilities; 4) integrating
GOSAT-GW satellite data into IMEO’s Methane Alert and Response System (MARS).



Imabari Shipbuilding acquires more stakes in JMU
(Company statement, June 26)
•  Imabari Shipbuilding will increase its stake in Japan Marine United (JMU) from 30% to 60%, thus
making JMU a subsidiary.
•  The new shares will come from co-investors JFE Holdings and IHI. The goal is to integrate
operations to better compete with Chinese and South Korean shipbuilders.
•  Imabari will hold 60% of voting rights in JMU, while JFE and IHI will see their stakes fall from 35%
to 20% each.
•  CONTEXT: Imabari is Japan’s largest shipbuilder. IMU is the second largest. And Japan is the world’s
third-largest shipbuilding nation.
• TAKEAWAY: Imabari is a key player in Japan’s energy transition, both as a maker of LNG carriers and future
vessels that will be fueled entirely with ammonia. Imabari is also involved in the development of liquified CO2
carriers, which will be used for CCS projects.

OCCTO draft on future electricity supply-demand scenarios for 2040-2050

(Agency statement, June 25)
•  OCCTO released a draft report summarizing discussions of the “Study Group on Future Electricity
Supply and Demand.”
•  Its scenarios are based on diversity, verifiability, objectivity, and adaptability: demand/ supply
assumptions, stakeholder input, and model scenario setting.
•  For demand, multiple model cases are set for both 2040 and 2050, with detailed breakdowns by
factor and supporting qualitative explanations and indicators.
•  For supply, model cases are developed for nuclear, renewables, batteries, and decarbonized thermal
with CCS, based on technical assumptions and public information, considering plant replacements.
•  Future load curves consider demand characteristics by factor, demand response (DR), and the
effects of on-site solar generation.
•  Scenarios will be reviewed every 3–5 years based on changes in assumptions, with earlier revisions
if needed.
•  CONTEXT: The study group launched in Nov 2023 to work on a long-term electricity supply and
demand scenarios for 2040 and 2050. These are shared among national authorities, relevant
institutions, and businesses to support implementation of long-term decarbonized power auctions and
planned power development. It differs in purpose from the Basic Energy Plan, supply plans, or
interregional grid master plans.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: This current scenario includes projections extending to 2050, going beyond the "Outlook for
Energy Supply and Demand in FY2040" published as a reference for the 7th Basic Energy Plan. It serves as a
reference for measures to achieve carbon neutrality. Detailed simulations were conducted using separate models
developed by the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI), the Research Institute of
Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE), and Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. The differences in results stem
from varying assumptions and model characteristics and are noteworthy.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
OCCTO proposes supply-demand measures for intra-area grid congestion
(Agency statement, June 24)
o  OCCTO proposed supply-demand measures in response to intra-area grid congestion.
o  In the event of grid congestion, the constrained supply is deducted from the reserve margin
to assess risks and plan countermeasures. If the available grid capacity is small and difficult
to address, no deduction is made.
o  In case of intra-area congestion, additional supply measures are made only in uncongested
grids. If the location cannot be identified, action may be taken regardless of congestion
status. OCCTO's power transfer instructions specify transmission areas based on the
congestion situation.
o  Even if the area reserve margin exceeds 3%, OCCTO may issue power transfer instructions
as needed if actual conditions worsen due to local constraints.
o  CONTEXT: In Japan, a non-firm connection is used when connecting a power source to a
transmission line with limited capacity. This type of connection assumes output curtailment
during grid congestion. Also, a redispatch system has been introduced under which both non-
firm and other types of connections are subject to output curtailment according to a merit
order. However, as the impact of grid constraints on supply and demand operations has become

more apparent during periods of peak demand, discussions have begun regarding how to
calculate reserve margins and operate the supply and demand system when constraints arise
within regional grids.



ANRE sets requirements for offshore wind zero premium projects in capacity market
(Government statement, June 25)
•  ANRE outlined requirements for offshore wind power projects with zero premium to participate in
the capacity market.
•  For publicly solicited projects with bid prices of ¥3/ kWh or less, participation in the capacity market
under the FIP is permitted, on condition of forgoing the portion of the FIP grant equivalent to
balancing costs.
•  However, allowing these projects to receive the FIP grant, even if they bid in the capacity market but
fail to win a contract, could influence bidding behavior compared to when the grant is not received.
•  CONTEXT: Offshore wind power is eligible to participate in the capacity market; however, projects
under the FIT/ FIP were not allowed to participate in order to prevent double recovery of fixed costs.
Since zero-premium projects do not receive FIP subsidies, the February meeting decided that such
projects may participate in the capacity market even during the FIP period, on condition that they forgo
the portion of the subsidy equivalent to balancing costs.

Results of 24th solar FIP bidding with majority at ¥0/ kWh
(Organization statement, June 20)
•  OCCTO disclosed results of the first round of FY2025 auctions for FIP-certified solar projects with
outputs of over 250 kWh.
•  Notably, 38 of the 57 winning projects, about 36% of total capacity, bid ¥0.00/ kWh, indicating
revenue that relies entirely on market-based contracts or sales.
•  The 38 winning projects with a ¥0/ kWh bid were from Chiiki Denryoku/ HEXA Renewables, GPSS
Agri B, Mitsubachi 101, and Bison Energy.
•  The two largest overall bids were from Mirai Soden Gamo Hino (19.5 MW at ¥5.7/ kWh) and Machi
Okoshi Energy (9.99 MW at ¥7.77/ kWh).
• TAKEAWAY: More firms appear to opt for ¥0/ kWh contracts to enter and build a market presence, indicating
they use the scheme to secure grid access ahead of finalizing PPAs.

Kansai power futures trading surges 3.7-fold

(Nikkei, June 27)
•  Power futures trading in Kansai region surged, with total volume from January to June 20 rising 3.7
times compared to the same period last year, said the EEX.
•  According to EEX, the trading volume for all Kansai contracts in the first half of this year
(specifically, Jan 1 to June 20) reached about 20 TWh, a sharp rise from the 5.4 TWh in the same
period in 2024.
•  This growth is driven by an increase in the number of trading participants and trading volume per
company. Major utilities from western Japan, such as Chugoku Electric, have begun trading.
•  The number of participants trading in Kansai rose to 44 companies by May, up from 27 in May
2024. The number trading over 100 GWh doubled from 6 to 15.
•  Currently, Japan’s power futures cover two regions: Tokyo and Kansai. Until around 2023, nearly
90% of the trading was in Tokyo area contracts, but from January to June 2025, Kansai’s share of
the volume has grown to about 30%.
•  CONTEXT: Power futures are financial instruments that allow buying and selling of electricity at a fixed
price for future delivery, such as in a year. These contracts settle the price difference with spot electricity
on the JEPX. Sellers lock in prices, while buyers can hedge against unexpected increases in procurement
costs.
• TAKEAWAY: Buoyed by improved liquidity in Kansai, EEX plans to introduce daily futures trading in the region,
which is now available only in Tokyo. Daily futures are used to hedge short-term price fluctuations, such as
those caused by weather-related supply-demand imbalances.

waters. Spar-type ones, cylindrical
structures that extend deep below the
waterline to lower the center of gravity,
maintain stability and reduce sensitivity to
wave motion.
•  The WHEEL foundation, primarily made of
concrete, is less costly.

Kyushu Electric’s president says nuclear power vital

(Nikkei, June 27)
•  Nishiyama Masaru, Kyushu Electric’s new president, aims to accelerate decarbonization by shifting
the company’s business model.
•  Instead of relying on long-term operation of power plants for returns, he plans to sell power assets
earlier. This is to recycle capital into new projects. Kyushu Electric has set a target of ¥1.5 trillion in
decarbonization investments by FY2036.
•  He emphasized that nuclear energy remains crucial for Kyushu. The region can become a hub for
data centers and semiconductor industries due to its stable and low-carbon power supply. But, he
said that nuclear projects face long construction periods and uncertain financial returns. This makes
state-backed financing essential.
•  For renewables, Nishiyama advocates early-stage sales of developed projects rather than long-term
ownership. He also wants Kyushu Electric to go beyond development and engage in integrated
renewable operations. These include selling bundled projects and managing plant operations.
•  On floating offshore wind, he said Japan must capture first-mover advantages. These systems are
essential due to geographical challenges for fixed-bottom installations.
•  On coal, he supports phasing down rather than full shutdowns; transitional technologies like
ammonia co-firing and CCS could maintain stable supply.

METI discusses transport and support measures for CCS
(Government statement, June 25)
•  METI will select CCS projects starting in the early 2030s. An evaluation system will assess project
plans.
•  CCS support covers the gap between actual CCS project costs and CO2 abatement costs borne by
emitters. Support will last until CCS becomes cost-competitive.
•  Pipeline projects have priority. Shipping-based CCS will come later.
•  Pipeline transport has high upfront costs and cross-chain risks due to fixed infrastructure. Mitigation
requires regional CO2 source aggregation to gain economies of scale and share risks.
•  Ship transport has higher operational costs (liquefaction, shipping) but offers flexibility. An efficient
model could be of centralized CO2 sources and liquefaction facilities. That is, creating a hub-cluster
model.
•  A common ship type and standardized value chain are being pursued to improve efficiency and
reduce fleet size.
• TAKEAWAY: Support targets capture, transport, and storage based on Benchmark price and Reference price.
Benchmark price is capture (CAPEX + OPEX) + auction-based transport/ storage fees. Reference price is annual
carbon price. The amount of support will equal Benchmark − Reference.

ANALYSIS

BY YURIY HUMBER

In a Volatile Energy Neighborhood, Who You Gonna Call? LNG
A reliable method to gauge industry momentum is to follow the money. Applying this
logic to recent remarks from global energy executives points to LNG. Amid significant
shifts in energy policy and market sentiment, the LNG sector is emerging as the focal
point for investment and planning, reflecting an industry-wide pivot toward
pragmatism, security, and affordability.

During recent conferences in Tokyo, executives from energy majors reiterated a
commitment to low-carbon fuels and said that decarbonization remains firmly on their
agendas. However, their primary emphasis has shifted toward LNG due to its ability to
balance decarbonization goals with immediate and realistic energy needs. This aligns
perfectly with Japan’s own energy security and affordability concerns.
This pragmatic pivot is underlined by immense financial appetite: LNG projects alone
are expected to attract investment of $200 billion in just the next five to seven years,
with top Japanese firms eager to benefit from this anticipated "golden age for gas."

Further fueling this investment surge is a dramatic increase in energy demand driven by
the technology sector, particularly data centers powering cloud computing, AI, and
quantum computing infrastructure.

Forecasts suggest power consumption from data centers could spike by more than
1,500% over the coming years, propelled by various AI applications and advances in
computational capabilities. Energy providers, sensing this massive growth opportunity,
are quickly aligning their expansion strategies to supply the burgeoning energy appetite
of the technology giants.
Japanese officials emphasize that green energy initiatives remain central to the GX
(Green Transformation). Plans in hydrogen, battery technology, renewables, and
nuclear power continue to advance. But concerns are mounting among industry leaders
and bureaucrats at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) about the
ability of these to satisfy demand growth.

Consequently, the immediate priority is strengthening Japan's foundational energy
infrastructure through investments in LNG, viewed increasingly as indispensable to
ensuring stability and economic resilience.

It’s different now
“I wouldn’t say that focus on sustainability has slowed, but there’s a recognition the
transition will look different from what people saw 5-10 years ago,” said BP’s SVP
Marisa Buchanan at the Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition in Tokyo. She added that
with geopolitics at center stage and a new focus on security and affordability,
sustainability is no longer the top priority.
LNG veterans, such as Steve Hill from Mercuria, lamented that LNG often serves as a
fallback for ambitious clean initiatives that don’t materialise, and yet the sector rarely
received due recognition or international policy support. Hill was skeptical about the
outlook for renewable energy sources in Asia and urged regional leaders to focus on
creating benchmarks for LNG that are separate from those of Europe and the U.S., thus
better reflecting local realities.

19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Shell CEO Wael Sawan was even more forthright. “We have absolute conviction in the
future of LNG”, forecasting a 60% growth in demand over the decade. The global LNG
market is now at around 400 Mtpa, but will surely expand to 700 Mtpa, Sawan added,
citing vast growth in the marine sector where more than 2,000 ships are on order with
dual-fuel engine that can run on LNG, as well as China’s annual demand growth for
natural gas expanding to double digits.
That sector growth will likely require vast investments. Current liquefaction plants
suggest a CAPEX of around $1 billion per 1 Mtpa. Investments in pipelines and upstream
natural gas development for greenfield sites can easily double or triple that figure,
suggesting the need for hundreds of billions of dollars to meet the sector’s expansion
targets.

Traditionally, Japan has been a big part of that investment story – and many of the
overseas executives that visited Tokyo last month touted their new projects and
available capacity. These are primarily in the U.S., but officials such as TotalEnergies
CEO Patrick Pouyanné warned about looking further afield – at Africa, the Middle East,
South America, and elsewhere – to avoid swapping one regional energy dependency for
another.
Japanese tastes also changing
The approach of Japanese LNG buyers, however, has changed with the years. As the
country’s own demand for the fuel wanes, and power market demand becomes more
volatile, Japanese imports seek greater flexibility on delivery terms and volumes, and
scrutinize the CO2 impact of cargoes more than before.

Sugesawa Nobuhiro, senior managing executive officer at Tokyo Gas, stressed that
Japanese firms are no longer immediately interested in buying equity in new LNG
projects as a way of securing offtake agreements.
Japanese firms are more attuned to judging the financial impact of these investments
and whether they will be seen by their own investors as efficient use of capital with the
risks justified. More and more, Japanese buyers will judge new project investment
opportunities based on whether they can and wish to market the LNG cargoes to their
clients or not.

The challenge of making investments, rather than simply buying the fuel, is magnified
by rising LNG project costs. Hara Tadashi, the EVP at Mitsubishi Corp’s Diamond Gas
highlighted how higher interest rates and construction expenses make new LNG projects
difficult. This is where Japanese investors will look at differentiation.
For example, Hara, whose parent firm invested in the LNG Canada project, praised the
Canadian regulatory environment for its stability and also talked up the lower carbon
footprint of the country’s facilities due them using hydroelectric power.

Don’t forget about hydrogen
Voices in favor of hydrogen, ammonia and synthetic fuels were more subdued this year
at the Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition, and barely audible during the LNG Producers-
Consumers Conference staged by METI immediately afterwards. But the sector has not
fallen out of favor in the Japanese capital – World Hydrogen Asia will be held in Tokyo
on July 8-10.
While progress as an alternative to LNG has slowed due to rising costs and disparity
between the prices manufacturers can offer and the costs consumers are willing to
endure, energy officials and stakeholders were keen to point out that their future
remains on the up.

METI’s top hydrogen planner, Hirota Daisuke, confirmed that interest in its Contract for
Differences (CfD) support plan was oversubscribed (more than 30 bids) and the initial
round won’t have enough money to satisfy most bidders.Thus, he urged suppliers to
seek other sales avenues. Power is one sector bound to drive revenue, with METI keen to
offer a better hydrogen subsidy in the next round of the Long-Term Decarbonized Power
Source capacity auction.
Meanwhile, Muraki Shigeru, head of Japan’s Clean Fuel Ammonia Association,
confirmed that the technologies to support hydrogen use in industry are well on their
way to commercialization. The smaller 2 MW turbines that can run on ammonia fuel
already function and large 400 MW units will be available in the early 2030s.

A 700 MW diesel engine that can also run on ammonia is due to hit the market by 2026.
These developments should lead to industrial furnaces, naphtha crackers and boilers
being able to utilize clean-burning ammonia in the next five years or so. Japan’s
ammonia demand could hit 30-40 million tons a year by 2040, Muraki said.
Energy – now
Firms like JERA say they’re spreading their bets. Renewable energy and low-carbon fuels
like ammonia and hydrogen are central to development strategy, said JERA’s global CEO
Kani Yukio. But with uncertainties about the speed of the rollout of cleaner technologies,
the utility is keen to ensure that it can deliver energy without interruptions. And, for
Kani, that means securing JERA’s position in the gas sector.

Kani revealed that JERA’s LNG inventory in the Tokyo Bay area is enough to meet just
10 days of current demand, making volatility in delivery due to conflict, logistic issues,
or the weather a cause of concern. As such, JERA looks favorably at the “concept” of a
major LNG project in Alaska that could deliver the chilled molecules to Japan within
about seven days.
“New LNG supply after 2030 is limited and this is maybe the last round to secure cost
effective LNG contracts as EPC costs are growing,” he said. Meanwhile, Japan’s demand
is also in for greater volatility as the differences between peak and low demand seasons
are already a factor of two, and that will become a factor of three by 2030.

To ensure JERA can balance volatility on both sides, Kani seeks to connect the AI boom
to gas. With two-thirds of data center demand in Japan in Tokyo and the surrounding
area, where JERA has the majority of its power plants and other facilities, the company
wants to lure developers to build new data centers adjacent to its power plants. That
will alleviate grid connection issues and the scramble to secure land sites on the client
side, and will offer JERA a big-volume baseload power user to help justify longer-term
LNG purchase contracts.
Kani acknowledged that Big Tech’s data center end-users still want to “hear the
decarbonization story”. To this, Kani proposed that JERA use LNG’s low temperature to
help cool data centers and to mix the electricity supplied to these facilities with those
produced by the power company’s offshore wind projects, which are due to start up
around 2030.

“These facilities need 24/7 power. That’s what we want to provide,” Kani said.

ANALYSIS

BY MAGDALENA OSUMI and ANDREW SMALL

Chinese Solar Panels – Are Geopolitical and
Monopolization Fears Justified?

In recent weeks, Japan has witnessed an intensifying debate over Chinese-made solar
power equipment, fueled by growing concerns about its potential to be controlled
remotely by malign actors and to interfere with the grid.

Spurred by investigative reports in international media, these revelations prompted the
government to initiate a probe into China-made inverters, crucial devices in an
electricity system. METI and affiliated organizations are now investigating. Concerns are
heightened by the blackout on the Iberian Peninsula earlier this year.
This highlights the technical and security vulnerabilities of Japan’s electrical grid, which
faces reassessment amid growing calls for upgrades to tackle issues such as limited
interregional connectivity, aging infrastructure, and insufficient capacity to integrate
variable renewables like solar and wind.

The allegations concerning Chinese PV and grid technology raise a critical question: Do
they reflect genuine security concerns or is China unfairly scrutinized amid broader
industrial and geopolitical anxieties over its market dominance?

Abroad-originated concerns
The issue gained traction in Japan after similar concerns were raised in the U.S. and
Europe, mainly in response to alarming media reports that sparked debate and legal
action. On May 14, Reuters claimed rogue communication equipment was found in
Chinese-made solar installations, prompting U.S. officials to investigate.
The devices in question were power inverters, the component of solar panels that
converts electricity to feed directly into the energy grid. The discovery raised fears that
malign actors could shut off or alter the inverters remotely, which could destabilize,
damage, or destroy the energy grid. The article quoted anonymous inside sources and
did not provide exact figures on how many panels were inspected.

For much of the past decade, China has held sway over the global solar supply chain,
with control over more than 80% of capacity across several key segments including cells,
modules and materials. Coupled with many other serious issues, this market dominance
has fueled anti-Chinese sentiment and suspicions across the G7.
Since 2010, China’s companies have rapidly conquered the Japanese solar market. Once
a global leader with around 50% of global solar module production in the early 2000s,
Japan’s domestic output has significantly plummeted to less than 1%, unable to compete
against low-cost Chinese units.

Amid rising concerns about Chinese firms active in critical infrastructure in the U.S. and
Europe, in March, two U.S. lawmakers submitted the Decoupling from Foreign
Adversarial Battery Dependence Act, which would ban the Department of Homeland
Security from procuring batteries from six Chinese firms: Contemporary Amperex
Technology Company (CATL), BYD Company, Envision Energy, EVE Energy Company,
Hithium Energy Storage Technology Company, and Gotion High-tech Company.

In Europe, following the massive blackouts on the Iberian Peninsula in April, concerns
grew over the outsized role that Chinese technology plays in energy infrastructure, and
solar in particular. While experts estimate that control of just 3-4 GW of Europe’s
electricity would be enough to massively disrupt the energy grid, around 200 GW of
solar capacity operates with Chinese-made inverters.
Against this sensitive background, the Reuters article that claimed doubts over the
integrity of inverters sparked a firestorm of controversy and interest in the role that
Chinese technology plays within the broader energy infrastructure.

Japan’s probe into Chinese PV tech
The issue prompted Japan’s government to launch a formal investigation in late May,
with the news curiously making headlines outside of Japan first. One article that first
ignited debate within Japan appeared in the South China Morning Post. Meanwhile, the
claims received little coverage in Japan’s mainstream media, with only pro-government,
conservative Sankei Shimbun reporting on the issue.
During a recent House of Councillors session, METI Minister Muto addressed allegations
that Chinese-made solar power generation systems may contain suspicious
communication devices. He said no such cases have been reported but emphasized
ongoing international cooperation and the importance of cybersecurity. He noted that
countermeasures against outside interference with the equipment are already required
from operators.

Opposition lawmakers still called for a full investigation, given the extensive role that
Chinese companies play in Japan’s solar sector – from grid equipment and panel
suppliers to investors and developers of solar farms and other green assets. According to
lawmakers’ comments, loopholes in foreign investment rules don’t require full
transparency on corporate entity ownership, which is a concern because of land and
asset resales in the solar sector.
Justice Minister Tanaka acknowledged the potential national security risks and said
policy revisions are under consideration.

Role of solar inverters
What are the core concerns behind the probe into Chinese solar technology? Solar
inverters serve as the "brains" of solar energy systems, converting the direct current
generated by solar panels into alternating current usable by homes, businesses, and the
power grid. Without inverters, solar electricity cannot be integrated into existing
infrastructure. These devices often include remote access for maintenance and updates,
and are used in clean energy technologies, including wind turbines, batteries, heat
pumps, and EV chargers.
Following concerns raised in the U.S. and Japan, South Korea also began examining the
potential cybersecurity risks of Chinese-made inverters. Notably, up to 95% of inverters
available in South Korea are manufactured in China, though they are typically
rebranded and sold under the names of Korean companies.

Japan’s role as a global solar inverter producer is minor, overshadowed by China where
75% of the products are manufactured. Japanese companies like Omron, Sharp,
Mitsubishi Electric, TMEIC, and Kyocera design and manufacture inverters tailored to
Japan’s strict JET certification standards.
While these home brands hold a strong domestic market position due to quality and
certification compliance, they face high production costs, making their inverters
significantly more expensive – about 35–50% more than Chinese-made equivalents.

Security threat or market fear?
The growing debate over Chinese-made solar panels underscores not only legitimate
technical and security concerns but also deeper anxieties about China’s dominance.
While Japan launched a formal probe following international alarm, questions remain
whether the scrutiny is driven primarily by genuine risks or by fears within the industry
of losing market share to Chinese firms. As Japan’s energy grid undergoes critical
reassessment, balancing security with fair market competition will shape the country’s
renewables future.

None of the governments investigating the issue have concluded a probe or succeeded in
confirming the allegations. But if confirmed, the impact on the market for devices used
in the solar industry would be profound.

Complicating the situation further, Japan is not well placed to switch to domestic
production should it find that Chinese inverters really are a risk. Buying the devices
elsewhere, whether from home brands or allied nations would also inevitably lead to
higher costs for solar power and grid modernization – something that Japan can ill
afford as it embarks on a wholesale revamp of its electricity transmission infrastructure.
In the meantime, expect officials to keep stressing the need to improve cybersecurity of
grid and grid-connected facilities, and look more closely at energy asset ownership.
