Miyagi walks back some of its renewables tax proposals; seeks feedback
(Japan NRG, July 18)
•  Following the July 4 passage of the renewables tax system by the local assembly, the Miyagi Pref
discussed its proposal to create a category called “promotional operators” that would be tax-
exempt.
•  Miyagi plans a 20% tax on the operating profit of solar, wind and biomass operators that cut down

over 0.5 hectares of forest. Operators in renewables promotion zones will be exempt. If local
stakeholders recognize the operators as “collaborative”, then they’ll be granted “promotional
status” and be tax exempt.
•  Miyagi drafted guidelines for the “collaborative/promotional status” and seeks feedback from the
public and renewables operators.
•  The prefecture hopes to start the new system by Jan 1.
•  CONTEXT: Municipality taxes require approval from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and

Communications. The Japan Wind Power Association is concerned that this will deter wind
development and hinder national climate targets. The chances of ministry approval increases if the
prefecture shows the plan can drive “collaborative engagements”.
• TAKEAWAY: Miyagi’s approach shows the limitation of “renewables promotional zones”. Municipalities will
define areas where solar and wind power are encouraged. As of April, nine municipalities set up promotional
zones — mostly town halls and residential areas — to promote rooftop solar installation. Several officials told
Japan NRG that zones are pointless because operators that aren’t accountable will raise issues anyway; and it’s

not easy for municipalities to set up zones because they can face opposition from residents.



Mitsubishi, Keppel partner on Singapore’s first hydrogen-ready cogeneration plant

(Company statement, July 19)
•  Keppel, Mitsubishi Power, and Jurong Engineering began construction for Singapore's inaugural
hydrogen-ready cogeneration plant, known as the Keppel Sakra Cogen Plant KSC). It will have a
combined cycle gas turbine (600 MW capacity).
•  KSC was built to co-fire with 30% hydrogen, and eventually run on 100% hydrogen.
•  Completion is expected in early 2026; initially, it will utilize natural gas as fuel.
•  Keppel is keen to collaborate with international partners to advance low-carbon hydrogen and

hydrogen-derived fuels, such as green ammonia.
• TAKEAWAY: Singapore aims to generate up to 50% of its power from hydrogen by 2050. Local companies like
Keppel and Sembcorp Industries, along with Japan's MHI, are leading efforts to build infrastructure for
hydrogen-based energy. However, challenges remain, such as safety, turbine development, and
transportation. While Singapore sees its small size as an advantage for developing hydrogen infrastructure, it

may have to rely on imports, raising costs and supply worries. Thus, the jury is still out on the practicality and
scalability of hydrogen-fired technology.



Itochu, Sumitomo to launch $500 mln clean energy fund in North America
(Nikkei Asia, July 21)
•  Itochu and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank will launch a $500 million fund for North American solar

and wind projects, as well as for hydrogen and ammonia as fuel.
•  Both will invest $50 million each; Tokyu Land Corp and Fuyo General Lease will invest $40 million.
•  The fund will invest in as many as 10 projects over three years; each deal will average $50 to $100
million. The focus will be on operational or construction-stage projects, which are less risky.
•  CONTEXT: This will be one of Japan's largest funds for overseas renewable energy. Solar and wind
accounted for 14% of total power generated in the U.S. last year. That will reach 20% by 2024,
helped by govt subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act.



Japan and India to collaborate on semiconductors and hydrogen
(Nikkei Asia, July 17)
•  Japan and India will cooperate on developing semiconductors and hydrogen fuel. METI Minister
Nishimura will visit India to meet with their Information Technology Minister and Minister for Power
and Renewable Energy. They’ll sign an MoU to set up a framework for Japanese and Indian
companies to cooperate.
•  The two countries will share information on semiconductor technologies that are eligible for

subsidies.
•  In terms of hydrogen fuel, both nations seek safety regulations for transport. India considers green
hydrogen as a key part of national strategy. However, a lack of hydrogen pipelines and strict
regulations pose challenges.
•  Japan will support India in infrastructure development, particularly in water and power, which are
essential for the chip industry.



INPEX, Masdar to study e-methane production in UAE
(Company statement, July 18)
•  INPEX and Abu Dhabi Future Energy (Masdar) will do a study to produce synthetic methane (e-
methane) using carbon and green hydrogen in the UAE.
•  They’ll also study the transport of e-methane from the Middle East to Japan, to cover the entire e-

methane value value chain.
• TAKEAWAY: The UAE participates in the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), which allows INPEX to count some
carbon offset credits derived from UAE projects. MoE is in negotiations with other govts about counting of e-
methane-derived credits at the site of fuel consumption rather than production, but these talks have been
deadlocked. Gas companies say such a system is essential for e-methane projects, notably in the industrialized
economies that fall outside the JCM framework.

Tokyo Gas sells Japan’s first hydrogen produced from AEM electrolyzer
(Company statement, July 13)
•  Tokyo Gas started producing and selling Japan’s first hydrogen made from Anion exchange
membrane (AEM) electrolyzer at its hydrogen refueling stations. The Senju station introduced the
AEM electrolyzer from Enapter, (Germany) and switched its electricity to 100% renewables.
•  The AEM electrolyzer is a new technology. Its simple configuration enables it to easily adjust

hydrogen production volume by combining multiple small modules, which brings benefits for
hydrogen stations with limited space.
•  Tokyo Gas produces 15 Nm3/ h of hydrogen by using 30 modules of the AEM electrolyzer. Those
modules are configured to have redundancy to continuously produce hydrogen. The machine will
keep running during the night and store hydrogen in the tanks.


Sojitz invests in turquoise hydrogen tech in Finland

(Company statement, July 18)
•  Sojitz invested in Hycamite TCD Technologies, a start-up and developer of turquoise hydrogen
production technology in Finland. Turquoise hydrogen is produced through methane pyrolysis,
and Hycamite produces hydrogen and solid carbon via thermos-catalytic decomposition of
methane.
•  Hycamite raised €25 million through a third-party allotment of shares underwritten by Sojitz, the
Finnish Climate Fund, and other investors. The company will build a demo plant to produce 2,000

tons of hydrogen that starts in mid-2024 in Finland.
•  Hycamite’s zero-carbon emission production technology requires only 13% of the energy needed
to produce hydrogen through electrolysis and makes carbon nanotubes and other solid carbon
products with different crystalline structures. Thus, the hydrogen can be used in next-gen lithium-
ion batteries and other composite materials.

Hokkaido Electric starts hydrogen production facility in Tomakomai
(Nikkei, July 18)
•  Hokkaido Electric launched a hydrogen production facility in Tomakomai. It comes with a rectifier
capable of transforming alternating current into direct current and an electrolytic cell that turns

purified water into hydrogen and oxygen.
•  Hokkaido has potential for renewable energy, but there may be imbalances between supply and
demand. To fully utilize renewable energy, options include increasing electricity demand in
Hokkaido or transmitting electricity to other regions with higher demand. A plan to build an
undersea power transmission line to Honshu is underway.
•  To address the issue of surplus electricity, storing it in batteries and producing electric hydrogen is
being considered. However, the risk of freezing during winter poses a challenge in a cold region

like Hokkaido.


National Spatial Strategy calls for measures to meet 30by30 targets
(Japan NRG, July 21)
•  In July, the MLIT compiled the 8th National Spatial Strategy, calling for initiatives to meet “30by30”
targets to conserve at least 30% of land and sea areas by 2030.
•  Japan’s nature conservation rate is 20.5% of land and 13.3% of sea areas. MLIT wants to expand

protected areas and add stricter conservation rules.
•  MLIT plans a new category of conservation areas to enhance biodiversity. Potential areas are small
lakes, hills, beaches and green space areas of businesses.
• TAKEAWAY: National Spatial Strategy is a 10-year land-use development plan. Japan has 15 areas specified as
Globally Important Agricultural Heritage, but renewables projects went ahead in some areas despite local
opposition. It’s uncertain what kind of impact this new “nature conservation category” will have.

Mitsubishi, Kyushu Electric launch battery storage to manage solar power curtailment
(Company statement, July 19)
•  NTT Anode Energy, Kyushu Electric, and Mitsubishi have launched a 1.4 MW / 4.2 MWh grid-scale
battery storage system in Fukuoka Pref. It promotes renewable energy by reducing solar power
curtailment.
•  Since June 2022, the three companies have collaborated to develop a business model that utilizes

surplus solar power and creates additional power reserves. They’ve successfully operated the grid-
scale battery storage system, minimizing curtailment and ensuring power supply during times of
high demand.
•  Verification of the battery storage system includes testing the business model's feasibility,
exploring multi-use of batteries in various power markets, and validating synchronous operation of
multiple solar plants connected to the system.
•  CONTEXT: An abundance of solar power production in Japan has often created situations where

the grid operator asks some operators to stop or curtail their output to the power network to avoid
a mis-match between supply and demand. This also results in wasted energy and lost profits for
operators.
• TAKEAWAY: In FY2023, the Kyushu area alone will lose about 740 GWh of electricity, enough to power
170,000 households for a year. Finding solutions to curtailment has been tricky. Major utilities have started to
install batteries to balance the supply peaks and troughs, though the storage capacity is still small. At this

stage, battery projects like this one in Kyushu are testing the waters to better understand what impact storage
will have. The biggest battery capacity is expected to initially in the Hokkaido region.

NIES study: About 20% of solar farms are in areas with landslide risks

(Nikkei, July 18)
•  The National Institute for Environmental Studies said that 1,658 out of 9,250 solar farms with over
500 kW capacity are built on land designated as “sediment disaster alert areas”, “landslide danger
zone”, “steep slope collapse danger zone”, or “landslide prevention area” in times of heavy rain.
•  For example, a 1.1 MW solar farm in Yokose town (Saitama Pref) was built in a sediment disaster
alert area. The construction company cut trees outside the approved site; this lowered water

retention capacity and required additional drainage. Between 2013 and 2022, similar cases were
found across Japan, except in Gunma, Okayama, Kyoto, Akita, Fukui, Tokushima, Yamagata, and
Tokyo.
•  The Forest and Forestry Basic Act was revised in April to improve approval for new construction;
the goal is to support local govts to ensure that solar farms are safe.
•  CONTEXT: After the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, the govt faced a power shortage

and thus encouraged the growth of solar farms. Capacity grew from 6.6 GW in 2012 to 78.8 GW in
2022. In an effort to quickly build capacity, risk assessment sometimes was lax and the environment
reviews were much easier than for other forms of energy, such as for wind power generation.

Japan proposes a global natural gas reserve; pledges methane cuts in LNG sector
(Japan NRG, July 18)
•  Japan suggested to the IEA to create a global stockpile for natural gas that could act as a buffer in
times of shortage and help stabilize prices.
•  The proposal came as part of the 2023 LNG Producer-Consumer Conference hosted by METI in
Tokyo. This year was the first time organized by METI and the IEA.
•  “The increasing attention to the need for ensuring reserves of natural gas/LNG presents an

opportunity to further discuss potential roles of the IEA in natural gas/LNG security, learning from
its experiences in oil stockholding systems and building on its in-depth energy markets knowledge
and analysis,” METI said.
•  CONTEXT: IEA members, including Japan, are required to hold an oil reserve equivalent to at least
90 days of imports. Japan’s stocks are about double this volume.
•  Japan sees merit in creating a global stockpile system for natural gas similar to the one for crude

oil. METI wants the global reserves proposal to be discussed at the IEA ministerial meeting in
February 2024.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s LNG storage facilities allow for only about 2-3 weeks of supply as the chilled fuel tends to
evaporate. Like its Asian neighbors, Japan doesn’t have an underground natural gas storage system like
Europe. This leaves Asian importers more vulnerable to supply disruptions and sudden price hikes.

• Earlier this year, Japan said it will form a “Strategic Buffer” system for LNG starting from the winter 2023/24.
The system will see a state company purchase some “surplus” LNG cargoes from Japanese importers in case
of weak domestic demand.

• METI has also pitched an Asian LNG hub, but the response was tepid. Now, taking a similar idea to the IEA,
Japan hopes for more traction. However, the logistics of operating a stockpile are complex, as are the
questions of cost and ownership of such a facility. There’ll also likely be many questions over the stockpile’s
impact on competition and market rules.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Pledge to cut methane in LNG sector signed by Europe, U.S., Japan, etc
(Government statement, July 18)
o  Japan and partners announced the launch of a new public-private framework to help
reduce emissions – especially in methane – throughout the LNG supply chain.

o  In part, this reiterates a commitment made at COP26 in Nov 2021 to cut methane
emissions 30% by 2030 (compared to 2020). The framework will be voluntary but
signatories pledge to encourage the use of independent verification and analysis by
organizations such as the IEA and the International Methane Emissions Observatory.
o  Japan and others will seek to collect data on emissions from each LNG portfolio, project,
and cargo around the world and then incentivize project operators to end methane leaks,
flaring and other actions that could reduce impact on the environment.

•  The first insured loan will be from Sumitomo Mitsui Banking to a Singaporean unit of JERA that
imports LNG. Previously, Japanese companies preferred long-term LNG procurement contracts to
stabilize prices. However, due to Japan’s decarbonization goals, businesses are now shifting to

short-term deals.
•  These are susceptible to price fluctuations since they’re based on spot market prices at time of

ANALYSIS

BY FILIPPO PEDRETTI

Fukushima's Water Release: Controversy and Economic Implications
Although the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster in March 2011 was the result
of the most devastating earthquake and tsunami ever recorded in Japan, the fact remains
that the country’s credibility in terms of technological prowess was also damaged.

The reaction from the global community was astonishment – how could a Pacific Ocean
nation that sits on one of the planet’s most active fault zones not take sufficient measures
to guard against earthquakes and tsunamis? Though unpleasant to face, this was a
legitimate question.

Now, more than a decade later, the ghosts of Fukushima once again haunt Japan in the
form of the decision to release one million tons of treated wastewater into the ocean. This
has triggered a debate that again casts a pall over Japan’s international standing and
reputation.

While Japan argues that this water release is necessary to address water storage
limitations and environmental concerns, the plan has faced opposition both domestically
and internationally over safety and the potential consequences for the regional economy.
What are the reasons behind Japan's decision and the reactions from neighboring
countries? And how will this impact the regional economy, as well as perceptions of
Japan’s commitment to environmental safety?


Skepticism over dilution plans
Soon after the 2011 disaster, Fukushima NPP grappled with the challenge of managing
contaminated water. Large volumes of groundwater enter the plant regularly, mixing with
the molten fuel and becoming tainted. To mitigate the issue, the facility extracts and
treats the tainted water, and is able to successfully eliminate almost all radioactive
elements.

The bad news, however, is that treated water held in the 1000 plus on-site tanks has
accumulated to almost 98% of storage capacity, requiring an urgent solution. The need to
alleviate this situation convinced TEPCO, the operator of Fukushima, of the need to
release the water into the ocean.

Among the few remaining radioactive components in the treated water, tritium poses a
unique challenge. TEPCO has treated the water using an Advanced Liquid Processing
System (ALPS) to remove most of the radioactivity. Tritium, however, cannot be removed
through purification. Prior to discharge, Japan will dilute the water to ensure tritium levels
are below regulatory standards.

The plan, which will be accompanied by the removal of storage tanks on the NPP site, has
drawn criticism from Japan’s neighbor, China. In June, Chinese social media campaigns
instigated a consumer boycott of Japanese cosmetics. Some companies, like Shiseido,
saw their stock value take a beating.

Need to address legitimate concerns
The idea of releasing tritium-contaminated water into the ocean raises some concerns.
However, to assess the situation fairly, it’s important to consider the broader context. The
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) emphasized that the planned dilution and
filtration are common practices within the nuclear industry, and that other countries also
release water containing specific radionuclides.

Many nuclear plants worldwide routinely release small quantities of tritium and other
radioactive materials into rivers and oceans as part of standard procedure. Japan's plan to
annually release a maximum of 22 trillion becquerels of tritium falls below the levels
released by other countries such as France, Canada, and neighbors China and South
Korea.

Japan's strategy involves diluting the water and releasing it gradually over four decades
through a subsea tunnel that’s one kilometer in length. The IAEA has conducted an
exhaustive two-year review of the plan, including regulatory activities, independent
sampling, and data analysis.

The IAEA determined that the methodical, gradual release of treated water will have an
inconsequential impact on humans and the environment, and thus endorsed its
implementation. After receiving the IAEA report, Prime Minister Kishida stressed that the
release will not pose any harm to humans or the environment, pledging to transparently
explain the decision.


Resistance and perception management
After the IAEA's assessment endorsing the safety of the water release plan, final approval
from Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) came on July 7, following a three-day
inspection. After the approval, a discharge in August was greenlighted, but no clear
timeline has yet been given.

Meanwhile, local fishing associations in Fukushima Prefecture have expressed
apprehension. Residents and seafood exporters have also voiced opposition to the plan,
concerned about potential damage to their businesses and reputations. That outside
perception of risk is more material for local businesses than the physical realities of the
release. And how to change popular perceptions is perhaps the main challenge that
TEPCO and PM Kishida now face.

The damage from these perceptions, often fueled by rumors and hearsay, are very real. In
early July, China suspended food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, without giving
any credible scientific justification. (What’s even more surprising, four of the prefectures
are landlocked.) In response, companies such as Shiseido and Procter & Gamble issued
statements reassuring the safety of their products in response to Chinese concerns.

The Japanese government is trying to reassure its neighbors about the project’s safety,
citing the IAEA report as a basis for their explanation. A needed boost has also come
from the U.S., which voiced support after the IAEA validated the safety standards
involved. South Korea, following its own assessment and recent efforts to improve
relations with Japan, has also acknowledged the IAEA's review. A similar seal of approval
came earlier in the year from the G7 Summit.

Nevertheless, South Korea’s ban on Fukushima food will stay in place, and the main
opposition party still opposes the plan, with South Korean shoppers reportedly buying
large quantities of sea salt prior to the water’s release.

Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, said the city would ban seafood products from numerous
prefectures if Japan proceeds with the release. Such opposition could have significant
economic impact, as Hong Kong is the second-largest importer of Japanese food
products after mainland China. Japan protested, explaining the process in detail and
assured Hong Kong of the safety of Japanese food.

Half a world away, the EU has lifted restrictions on Japanese food imports in place since
the 2011 nuclear accident. The EU had required pre-export testing of food products from
certain Japanese prefectures to ensure they were not contaminated. Even after lifting the
restriction, however, the EU called for Japan to continue monitoring for radioactivity and
to share its findings.

Public concerns over the release of contaminated water have hit Kishida's approval rating,
which is down to 34.4% from 40% in June. According to one poll, about 80% of
respondents say the government's explanations of the water release are insufficient.

Moreover, 87.4% believe that regardless of government reassurances, the release of the
water will bring economic damage, simply because of rumors and emotional responses.
Once again, we see how the main problem is perception. Regarding the water release
itself, about 43% of respondents were unsure whether they would approve or disapprove
of it; while 31.3% approve and 25.6% oppose it.

While the opposition from regional neighbors is to a certain degree based on political
calculations, the concerns of local residents and associations tend to reflect a widespread
distrust of TEPCO and the government, especially how they handled the aftermath of the
Fukushima disaster in 2011.

As TEPCO moves closer to implementing the water release, transparency, constructive
dialogue, and considerations for the environment and the livelihoods of those affected
are of utmost importance. These will have a tremendous impact on how regional partners
view Japan. Hence, this issue goes far beyond environmental considerations and will have
geopolitical ramifications regarding Japan’s international reputation and credibility.

ANALYSIS

BY YURIY HUMBER

Japan Seeks to Lead in the Energy Future
Without Abandoning Present Ties

Within a single day last week, Prime Minister Kishida was pitching oil-rich Middle
Eastern states on opportunities to invest with Japan in green energy and also
delivering a video message of support for an LNG conference in Tokyo attended by
dignitaries of the world’s top buyers and sellers of natural gas.

After stops in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, where PM Kishida laid out a “Global Green
Energy Hub” concept to turn the Middle East from a hydrocarbon powerhouse to one
based on clean energy, he touched down in Qatar on July 18 to mend a relationship
that has frayed over the years due to Tokyo’s dwindling LNG purchases. The same
day, the Qatari minister for energy and CEO of the state’s main gas company,
delivered a speech at the LNG Producer-Consumer Conference, arguing that LNG will
be in high demand “for decades” after 2050.

A skilled diplomat, Kishida was Japan’s longest-serving foreign minister in postwar
history before taking on the mantle of PM in late 2021. Still, even with this experience,
Kishida and his officials are trying to thread the needle in an ever-more-volatile energy
space in which climate, social, industrial and geopolitical pressures are testing Japan’s
preference for a gradual, pragmatic shift away from fossil fuels.

Kishida’s proposal to the Middle East – and the broader global energy community – is
almost a textbook example of good international relations. Japan’s top oil and gas
producers are offered to invest in the new energy products that Tokyo wants to buy in
the future, thus compensating for the inevitable drop in hydrocarbon sales. The
investment menu Japan is putting in front of its partners includes clean hydrogen,
batteries, critical raw materials, and even semiconductors.

The problem for Kishida, and Japan as a whole, is that the fruit of these labors and
concepts will not ripen for years and possibly decades. Meanwhile, the next UN
climate summit, COP28, is already less than four months away. At which, like at almost
all previous editions, Japan will be berated by the environmental movement for
maintaining a relationship with fossil fuels.


Shrinking oil trade
The Middle East region accounted for 96.7% of Japan’s crude oil imports in May
2023. Oil’s share of the nation’s primary energy mix has steadily declined since 1990,
but it still makes up close to 40% of the total.

Just two suppliers, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, delivered over 80% of Japan’s oil
imports in May. Qatar added another 5%. The Saudis alone earned ¥1.8 trillion ($12.9
billion) from the trade.

So, it’s little surprise that Kishida’s Middle East tour last week consisted of a stop in
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and then Qatar.

Naturally, these meetings started with an expression of gratitude for stable oil
supplies over the years. But Kishida’s message focus was on what comes next with
global decarbonization and Japan’s shrinking population almost ensuring further
revenue declines.

The proposed Green Green Energy Hub would see oil-rich Middle East nations
continue to play a major role in global energy systems. This would happen not only by
converting their natural gas to hydrogen and ammonia, but also as investors in the
“green materials sector” — in batteries and in key manufacturing industries such as
semiconductor chips, according to Ministry of Foreign Affairs statements. Kishida’s
audience reportedly “concurred” with the idea.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia in particular has shown interest in Japanese investments,
but most have centered on the entertainment industry. The Saudi sovereign wealth
fund, PIF, has taken sizable stakes in games firms Nintendo and CAPCOM, and movie
maker Toei, among others.

Now, the government wants to turn foreign investor interest to its energy and
industrial plans.


Seeing green
Kishida has plenty of green vision to sell. The PM’s decarbonization strategy, called
the GX, is now enshrined in law and ready to deliver ¥150 trillion of investments in
everything from new battery manufacturing facilities, to plants that make electrolyzers,
clean fuels, renewable energy sources, and next-gen nuclear reactors.

The GX program is closely linked with a planned revival of the semiconductor
industry, with new factories expected in the Hokkaido and Kyushu regions.
Semiconductor production is highly energy intensive, however.

Beyond chips, the GX roadmap assumes a net-zero push across two dozen sectors,
but also makes clear that the government will be able to provide only a portion of the
headline ¥150 trillion. So far, Kishida has committed to financing ¥20 trillion of the
amount, via a bond issuance that will presumably be bought by private and overseas
institutions.

One aspect of the GX and energy transition that Japan wants Middle Eastern help
with is creation of a critical raw materials supply chain independent of China. The
latter dominates certain critical materials niches so completely that even when the
metal ores are mined elsewhere, they are sent to China for processing.

From the point of view of economic competitiveness and energy security, Japan has
sought to counter China’s dominance of these niches, such as rare earth metals, and
believes that joint investment with Arab countries in both extraction rights and
processing facilities are vital. Japan signed a similar critical raw materials agreement
with the U.S. earlier this year.


True blue
While pitching for the future, Kishida knows he cannot abandon the relations that
guarantee Japan’s energy security today. As with oil, demand for natural gas has

gradually declined in the country in the last 20 years, and especially in the last five
years, driven as much by the changing electricity market structures as well as climate
considerations.

The UAE and Qatar are among the top seven to eight LNG sellers to Japan, and
together with Saudi Arabia they’re all candidates to supply hydrogen or ammonia
made from natural gas. In fact, Japan has avoided labeling its hydrogen strategies as
“green” in part to allay concerns of Middle Eastern suppliers that their resources may
no longer be welcome.

Japan used to be an even bigger buyer of LNG, especially from Qatar. However, over
the years, as domestic demand has waned, Japanese buyers became reluctant to roll
over long-term deals with Qatar and the UAE, both of which offer good prices but
strict conditions on volumes, times of delivery and final port.

In late 2021, Japan’s biggest LNG importer, JERA, told Qatar that it won’t renew a
large 5.5 million ton annual long-term LNG contract, citing a lack of flexible terms and
uncertain demand outlook. This has caused friction not just on an economic but also
on a political level. Japanese buyers have not signed any new LNG deals with Qatar
since 2014 even as Chinese firms have stepped in to seal multi-decade commitments.

Kishida’s visit to Doha was the first by a Japanese premier in 10 years. As he promised
Qatar to ensure stable supplies, he likely tested the waters for Japan to switch some
of its Russian LNG volumes to Doha.

Still, tensions remain. As Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the Qatari Minister of State for
Energy Affairs, and President & CEO of QatarEnergy, delivered his remarks at the
LNG Produce-Consumer 2023 conference in Tokyo, he berated “emotional calls to
cancel hydrocarbons” as unhelpful to the billions in emerging countries that seek a
way out of energy poverty. He also forecasts that LNG will be in high demand beyond
the 2050 net-zero target of most countries.

Speakers from the LNG supplier side also warned the conference that the natural gas
and LNG sector is suffering from underinvestment that’s harming consumers and
producers, and asked for a return to more long-term contracts.

These comments show the challenge of trying to offer a “green” future while major
energy suppliers seek better terms for their product today.

Even the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, used his speech at the Tokyo
conference to portray LNG as a major contributor to energy security and stability, and
a fuel that can be a “major play in addressing climate change.”

The U.S. has produced arguably the most aggressive energy policy package to usher
in clean energy technologies with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act. But in the
last year it has also vastly expanded its LNG capacity and is on course to become the
world’s largest exporter, taking over from Qatar.

Considering the above, Kishida is not alone in trying to perform a balancing act in
energy policies. He will, however, hope he can deliver a few green wins before facing
a very different audience at the COP28 meeting in Dubai.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Brazil/ Oil production
Next month, state-run oil company Petrobras will update its 2024-2028 business plan.
Analysts expect capital expenditures similar to the $78 billion in the 2023-2027 plan.
There have been market concerns of a spending spree under the new leftist
government.

Baltic States/ Power grid
In early 2025, the Baltic States will decouple from the Russian power grid. Three
decades after splitting from the USSR, and 19 years since joining the EU, Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania still depend on Russia to ensure a stable power system.

China/ Oil imports
Oil refineries will increase Brazilian crude imports in Q3 to replace some of the lost
Saudi supply. China, the world's top crude importer, has booked nearly 1 mbpd of
Brazilian crude for August and September delivery.

Global power demand
The energy crisis and global economic downturn is expected to slow the growth of
global power demand in 2023, but a probable rebound in 2024 means more
renewable capacity must be developed, said the IEA. The global growth rate for
energy consumption is set to slow to less than 2% in 2023, down from 2.3% in 2022.
Europe/ Solar power
A heat wave is pushing solar electricity output to new highs. Electricity generation
from solar sources in Europe climbed 11% in the first half of the year, (YoY), to a
record 129 TWh, according to energy think tank Ember.

Morocco/ Natural gas
Shell will supply Morocco with an annual 0.5 bcm of LNG under a 12-year deal signed
with utility ONEE. The gas will be transported from Spanish ports using a pipeline
until Morocco builds LNG terminals. The LNG will help ONEE operate two power
stations in northern and eastern Morocco that used to operate on Algerian gas.

Netherlands/ Green hydrogen
Strict controls on nitrogen emissions undermine EU climate change efforts,
jeopardizing €10 billion of green tech investment in Rotterdam. The projects include
green hydrogen and biofuels plants, and would reduce CO2 emissions by 10 million
tons a year.

Poland/ Nuclear power
KGHM Polska Miedź and South Korea's Samsung C&T Corp will cooperate on low and
zero-emission technologies, including small modular reactors. Also, Daewoo
Engineering & Construction signed an MoU with Poland’s ERBUD to build new
projects, including nuclear power plants.

South Africa/ Renewables
Nearly half of the projects awarded under the relaunch of South Africa's renewable
power purchase program have failed, undermining plans to use wind and solar to
ease the nation's power crisis. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the country needs to fill
a 4 to 6 GW electricity production deficit.

U.S./ Geothermal power
Houston-based Fervo made a breakthrough with a full-scale, 30-day well test at its
Project Red site in north Nevada that generated 3.5 MW of electricity. Project Red will
connect to the grid later this year and power Google's data centers in Nevada.

Vietnam/ EVs
Automaker VinFast, a unit of Vietnam's largest conglomerate, Vingroup, will start work
on a $4 billion EV factory in the state of North Carolina next week. The plan calls for
the start of production in 2025, a year later than initially planned.
