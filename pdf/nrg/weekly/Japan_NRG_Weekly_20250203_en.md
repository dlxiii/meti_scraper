NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


PM Ishiba takes tactical approach with Trump, seeks to deepen Asia ties for resources

(Nikkei, Jan 30)
•  PM Ishiba is preparing for his first meeting with President Trump, which will be on Feb 7; energy
diplomacy will be at the forefront.
•  Trump seeks to boost energy exports, cementing U.S.’s status as the world’s top oil and gas
producer. Japan sources over 60% of its LNG from Australia, Malaysia, and Russia, but imported
8% from the U.S. in 2023. Increasing supplies of U.S. shale gas aligns with Ishiba’s strategy to
bolster energy security.
•  Ishiba is also deepening energy ties in Asia. His recent SE Asia tour firmed up Malaysia’s
commitment to LNG supply, and cooperation in CCUS and hydrogen.
•  He also agreed with Indonesia on resource and infrastructure cooperation, including a geothermal
project under the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC).
•  Equally, Ishiba is expanding Japan’s presence in Central Asia, a region rich in uranium, oil, gas, and
rare metals critical for electronics.
•  CONTEXT: Ishiba is positioning Japan as a key AI and energy player. Seeking insight into Trump’s
priorities, he consulted with SoftBank CEO Son Masayoshi, who recently won favor with Trump after
announcing a $500 billion AI investment.
• TAKEAWAY: Ishiba’s visit to the U.S. appears to be a tactical move to maintain amicable ties. However, Ishiba
reportedly passed up the chance to meet with Trump before his inauguration and is known for lacking
diplomatic experience. Ishiba’s focus on resource diplomacy aims to engage with the Trump Administration on
more business-like terms, while shoring up Japan's security and influence on the broader regional stage.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan considers supporting $44 bln Alaska gas pipeline project
(Reuters, Jan 31)
o  Japan is weighing potential support for a $44 billion gas pipeline project in Alaska as part
of efforts to maintain favorable trade relations with the U.S. and avoid tariffs.
o  PM Ishiba may discuss the project with Trump when they meet, though Japan remains
skeptical of the project’s commercial viability due to cost concerns.
o  Tokyo may offer exploratory commitments alongside other trade concessions, such as

increased U.S. LNG purchases and investment in U.S. defense and manufacturing, to
address the $56 billion trade deficit.
o  The project could help Japan diversify away from Russian LNG supply. Several U.S. current
and former officials have advised Japan to offer an increase in LNG purchases and the
Alaska project investment.
o  CONTEXT: The project to build an LNG facility in Alaska was first considered years ago, but
was shelved due to high infrastructure costs. In 2022, Mitsubishi agreed with state-owned
Alaska Gasline Development Corp to assess the feasibility of using local gas deposits to produce
ammonia, but there has since been no update on this plan. The project does, however, have
legal approval.
• TAKEAWAY: Softbank’s Son Masayoshi has shown that the way to win Trump’s approval is through mega-
projects; and so, PM Ishiba seeks a similar coup. Unlike Son, however, the PM cannot compel Japanese private
firms to engage, and without generous state guarantees businesses will assess the Alaska project based on its
economics. Should Trump show interest in investment from Japan, it’s likely that a multi-year feasibility study
will follow, buying Tokyo stakeholders time. Ishiba’s goal will be to avoid the extreme outcomes: one-sided
concessions or Trump losing interest in dealing with Tokyo. Japanese analysts fear Trump might bypass Japan
and negotiate security matters directly with China.

Govt to submit five energy and environmental bills to the Diet
(Denki Shimbun, Jan 27)
•  The govt will submit five energy and environmental bills to the Diet, seeking a legal framework for
the GX-ETS (carbon emissions trading system) starting in FY2026.
•  Companies emitting over 100,000 tons of CO2 a year will have to participate. The bill also outlines
a fossil fuel surcharge starting FY2028.
•  Other issues to be addressed are:
o  Creating a coordination mechanism for offshore wind base ports; to allow temporary use
by other companies in case of emergencies
o  Simplifying initial procedures for replacing onshore wind turbines and addressing
transparency issues; (this will be done by allowing the environment minister to disclose
EIA documents with operator consent)
o  Imposing stricter regulations on copper scrap dealers, including mandatory registration,

identity verification, and penalties; (there will be penalties for unauthorized possession of
cable-cutting tools)
o  Reintroducing a bill to expand offshore wind development in the Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ); (it failed in the previous Diet session)
•  The government is also considering a law to promote solar panel recycling, given the expected
surge in panel waste from the 2030s.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI to launch new power system reform discussions, submit bill to Diet
(Government statement, Jan 27)
o  In April, METI will establish a new panel to discuss revisions to the power system, focusing
on investment incentives and retail market regulations.
o  The reform plan, presented by METI’s advisory committee, aims to facilitate power
generation investment and improve electricity market mechanisms through three key
areas: long-term supply security, price index formation, and short-term trading.
o  The govt may amend the Electricity Business Act if necessary, with legislative discussions
expected within the year for potential submission to the Diet in 2026.
o  Public consultation will conclude by late March, after which formal recommendations will
be finalized.



METI unveils report for energy transition roadmap for construction machinery
(Government statement, Jan 31)
•  METI issued an interim report with guidelines for clean energy transition focusing on construction
machinery.
•  The 114-page document envisions a maximum adoption scenation, an aspirational goal rather than
a mandatory requirement, that would allow flexibility for adjustments based on market trends and
industry conditions.
•  It has been drafted based on electrification targets in the U.S. and France, and the current domestic
market for electric construction machinery.
•  Key challenges faced by the sector today include:
o  developing charging infrastructure at construction sites;
o  advancing collaborative technology development;

o  clarifying regulatory applications related to powertrain changes.
•  To address these issues, a research committee was formed with stakeholders from both the supply
side (manufacturers) and demand side (users and rental businesses). METI will continue
discussions with the private sector, together with MLIT and MoE.

technologies.
•  Current investments include Amogy (hydrogen from ammonia), Boston Metal (low-carbon steel),
Furbo Energy (geothermal power), and Infinitum Electric (energy-efficient motors).
•  CONTEXT: Trading house Mitsubishi owns over 90% of Marunouchi Innovation Partners, with 4.9%
held by MUFJ.
• TAKEAWAY: The number of domestic private funds that invest specifically in cleantech and related clean energy
companies remains small, with this Mitsubishi-led vehicle among the largest in the sector. In addition, several
state-backed funds exist, such as the public-private Japan Green Investment Corp for Carbon Neutrality (JICN),
but the latter invests and provides loans at the project level.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan announces new regulation on JCM credits
(Government statement, Jan 31)
o  Japan announced new regulations on JCM (Joint Crediting Mechanism) credits, as part of
the revised Climate Change Countermeasures Act. These measures aim to strengthen the
JCM system and corporate overseas expansion.
o  The regulations establish procedures for issuing and managing JCM credits. They include
electronic applications and certification of verification bodies.
o  The new rules take effect in April.

Chemical major Resonac to recycle plastics to produce ammonia
(Company statements, Jan 20 and Jan 30)
•  Chemical manufacturer Resonac unveiled a business model for recycling plastics and textiles into
CO2, hydrogen, and chemical raw materials such as acrylonitrile and ammonia. These will then be
transformed into various end products.
•  The recycling process involves gasifying plastics and other materials at high temperatures and
breaking them down to the molecular level, at which point hydrogen and CO2 can be extracted.
The hydrogen is used for power generation in fuel cells, which are installed at a hotel in Kawasaki
City.
•  CONTEXT: Resonac was formed in a 2023 merger between Showa Denko and what used to be Hitachi
Chemical. It claims the world’s oldest gasification chemical plant at its Kawasaki site, able to process
about 1 mln tons of plastic a year.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan NRG covered the “hydrogen hotel” in question in our May 22, 2023, issue. It is based near
Resonac’s Kawasaki site and receives hydrogen by pipeline. Since then, at least one other hotel has pledged to
switch some power to hydrogen fuel cells. While these examples are few, they show how sectors adjacent to
hydrogen or ammonia manufacturing sites can utilize these fuels without heavy infrastructure investments.




UBE to exit ammonia production ahead of schedule by 2028
(Company statement, Jan 28)
•  As part of a larger corporate reorganization, UBE will stop producing ammonia by March 2028,
more than two years ahead of schedule.

Toshiba, Chubu Electric to develop rock-based thermal energy storage

(Nikkei, Jan 30)
•  Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions, along with Chubu Electric, Shin Tokai Paper, and Shimada
City plan to commercialize rock-based thermal energy storage.
•  The approach leverages the natural properties of rocks — heating up quickly and cooling down
slowly – to store and release heat energy, acting as a natural battery.
•  The system will have a heat capacity equivalent to 10 MWh. The installation will include a large
rectangular tank (4m high, 11m wide, 4m deep) filled with rocks, heated up to 600°C (1,112°F)
within an hour.
•  In 2026, a demo will be held at a Shin Tokai Paper factory in Shimada City.
•  The tech’s advantages over conventional batteries are:
o  Unlike Li-ion batteries, rocks can be used indefinitely,
o  The system does not need scarce and pricey minerals like cobalt and nickel;
o  The estimated cost is about half that of battery storage systems.
• TAKEAWAY: Sustainable, large-scale energy storage is the holy grail for all non-fossil energy systems. Siemens
launched a large-scale demo plant for rock-based thermal power in Germany in 2019. Some U.S. experts believe
that non-traditional power storage is poised for a big year, especially due to its low cost. Japan’s project also has
a compact footprint compared to similar tests overseas.

IEA releases report on global nuclear energy

(Agency statement, Jan 28)
•  IEA issued ''The Path to a New Era for Nuclear Energy,'' which lists Japan as the most experienced
in restarting nuclear reactors.
•  Other countries face greater challenges in restarting reactors due to political or market reasons,
especially in regard to reactor maintenance.
•  The report also discusses the back-end costs of nuclear energy – reprocessing spent fuel, disposing
of high-level radioactive waste, and decommissioning. In Japan, these costs are covered by private
utilities-operators that must pay fees to state-authorized organizations for reprocessing,
decommissioning management, etc.
•  CONTEXT: Reopening a reactor can cost billions of dollars, regardless of its size or age. It may involve
significant technical difficulties, especially if dismantling has begun.



China tests of Fukushima seawater find no harmful levels

The Future of Japan’s Thermal Power Plants: A Precarious Balancing Act

To run or not to run: this is the dilemma facing Japan’s utilities as they weigh the future
of their aging thermal power plants. With stricter environmental regulations and
ambitious decarbonization targets, the once straightforward decision of whether to
switch on more baseload generation has become far more complex.
Utilization rates at coal-fired power plants of major utilities, also known as EPCOs, have
dropped below 60% from close to 80% in FY2018. And while the total installed capacity
of coal stations has inched higher, and is unlikely to drop in the coming decade, how
much the utilities rely on those units looks set to decline further.

EPCOs are now exploring seasonal shutdowns and reduced operations to stay within
state-mandated emissions limits, a shift that underscores the changing economics of
thermal power. From the coming fiscal year, there will also be a cap on the run rate of
less-efficient coal-fired power plants.

Until a decade ago, Japan’s power generation landscape was dictated by
straightforward calculations: forecast electricity demand, procure fuel, maintain plants,
and pass on costs to consumers through regulated tariffs. However, the liberalization of
Japan’s electricity market in 2016 ushered in a new era of cost competition, leading to
the closure of many older and less efficient thermal power plants.
The introduction of state-mandated emissions targets has further complicated matters.
Starting in fiscal year (FY) 2026, major emitters will face legal obligations to report
their carbon footprints and demonstrate reductions. By the end of the decade, a carbon
levy and mandatory emissions caps will require utilities either to cut emissions or to
purchase offset credits. These policies are already reshaping operational strategies.

Thermal power: Essential but controversial
Thermal power plants, which account for about 70% of Japan’s electricity generation,
play a critical role in ensuring grid stability. They provide balancing power to
compensate for the variability of renewables and help maintain frequency and voltage
stability. However, they are also Japan’s largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions.
As utilities pivot toward decarbonization, the operational hours of coal-fired plants have
declined, and many are being phased out.

The capacity factor, or run rate of coal-fired power plants operated by EPCOs fell to
56.6% in FY2023, the latest year for which all data is available. That percentage is even
lower when the coal plants operated by other companies, such as big industrial firms
with captive power stations, are taken into account.

Power capacity, generation, and capacity factors for coal-fired power plants

Still, progress in phasing out coal-power generation has been slow. Energy supply
concerns have delayed the retirement of inefficient plants, which continue to serve as a
backup during emergencies. METI has even asked utilities to alert the ministry before
announcing further plant closures in order to avoid capacity shortages in certain
regions.

Environmental assessments and operational restrictions
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system requires utilities to assess and
disclose the environmental consequences of their generation projects. For thermal
power plants, the EIAs cover air and water pollution, noise, and GHG emissions.
Compliance often necessitates operational restrictions, including limits on emissions
and output.
Major utilities participating in Japan’s wholesale electricity market (JEPX) face
additional pressures. Regulators mandate that utilities with dominant market positions
offer surplus power at prices reflecting marginal costs. However, there have been
instances where utilities have withheld power from the market to comply with
emissions limits specified in EIAs. Such self-restrictions are permissible, provided they
occur during periods of low demand to avoid distorting market prices.
JERA, Japan’s largest power generation company, offers a glimpse into the industry’s
evolving strategies. The company plans to idle several coal-fired plants during spring
and autumn – seasons of lower electricity demand – to reduce emissions. For example,

later this year operations at its Taketoyo Thermal Power Plant in Aichi Prefecture will
be scaled back.

The Taketoyo facility initially tried to lower its carbon footprint by adding biomass as a
second fuel. However, a fire in 2024 forced JERA to reduce the biomass co-firing ratio,
thus raising the volume of CO2 emitted per kilowatt hour. As a result, the plant’s
operating rate will now be curtailed so that it can meet EIA requirements.
Challenges in securing thermal power capacity
Japan’s electricity demand is poised to change significantly over the next decade. While
residential demand is expected to decline due to population shrinkage, and energy
efficiency gains are expected, industrial demand is projected to rise, driven by data
center expansion and semiconductor manufacturing.

Advances in Chinese and other nation’s AI technologies notwithstanding, domestic data
centers are seen as imperative to creating “the world’s most AI-friendly country”,
according to government strategy.
The rollout of clean energy capacity will need to occur even faster, not just to reduce
the nation’s CO2 footprint but also to cover the declining contribution of the thermal
stations.

Current plans show, according to OCCTO, that domestic thermal power capacity is set
to decline slightly after 2025. Plans for new thermal power plants are outpaced by
closures, with notable reductions in coal-fired capacity. For instance, by 2030, J-Power
plans to retire five coal-fired plants – amounting to 2.7 GW, or 30% of its domestic
thermal capacity. The company aims to replace these plants with facilities capable of co-
firing clean-burning fuels or employing integrated coal gasification combined cycle
(IGCC) technology.
Trends in Power Capacity
















Source: OCCTO “Compilation of Supply Plan for FY2024”

Market mechanisms and policy shifts
To accelerate the phase-out of inefficient coal-fired plants, Japan’s capacity market
imposes strict efficiency standards. Starting in FY2025, coal plants with an energy
efficiency below 42% will face annual capacity factor limits of 50% or less. Violations
will incur penalties of up to 20% of the contract value.

To ensure there is sufficient baseload capacity in its place, METI has tried to incentivize
new construction through several sets of capacity auctions. Within the LTDA capacity
auction, for example, there is a category to support the building of new LNG-fired
plants. The scheme, launched in 2024, promised to subsidize up to 6 GW of new gas-
fired capacity over the course of three auction rounds. METI ended up awarding
subsidies to LNG plants with 5.8 GW in total capacity in just the first round.
As a result, an additional 2.2 GW of subsidies for the LNG category were set aside in the
second round of LTDA, which is under way as of last month.

The new LNG capacity will take time to get built. Yet gaps in supply are starting to
appear already.

To ensure utilities keep their older thermal plants available at least as an emergency
backup, METI introduced a special reserve power supply auction. It offers payment for
thermal plants with capacities of over 100 MW to be available for standby in case of
emergency. However, the initial auction in 2024 failed to attract bidders, as plant
operators deemed the financial returns inadequate. METI is now revising the scheme.
The long-term outlook
Japan’s energy mix is undergoing a fundamental transformation and by 2040
renewables are expected to be the dominant source of power. Still, even then, the share
of thermal power in the nation’s mix is forecast at 40%. The impact of low-carbon fuels
such as hydrogen and ammonia is hard to estimate.

This means that in the coming few years, the government and utilities will be in a push-
pull situation and power supply volatility may increase. Officials will demand both
energy supply and low emissions, and utilities will need to choose their options with
several criteria in mind. Meanwhile, power markets will be sending their own signals to
generators.

Energy Jobs in Japan: 2025 Outlook

In the past 12 years, Japan’s renewable energy sector has grown rapidly, driven by
policy changes after the Fukushima incident and strong incentives. Renewables now
account for about 25% of Japan’s energy mix, with over 75 GW of installed capacity.

December saw the outline for the 7th Strategic Energy Plan, which outlines an increase
in renewable capacity to 40-50% of the energy mix by 2040. Nuclear power is also
slated to increase, certainly through reactor restarts, though also encouraging
replacement reactors on existing sites and potential new buildout.
As opposed to the previous plan released in 2021, which was prior to key global events
such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflicts, as well as the rapid
rise of energy hungry AI and data centers, the current plan predicts an increase in
overall energy consumption. This has led to a sudden embrace of nuclear power.

Last October, Shigeru Ishiba became Japan’s new Prime Minister. A longtime advocate
for renewable energy and decarbonization, in his first speech he mentioned that energy
demand will rise due to AI and digitalization, even before the new Strategic Energy Plan
is released.
Despite Donald Trump’s re-election to office in the U.S., and close U.S.-Japan ties, the
key factors of increasing energy demand and importance on energy security for Japan
point in the direction of a growing, further diversified and distributed energy market for
Japan. Let’s look at our outlook for the job market in key sectors for 2025.

PPA demand Increase
Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) are growing in Japan, driven by strong
private sector demand for green energy. Last year, Shizen Energy signed CPPAs with
Microsoft and Google for 30 MW each, while Invenergy secured a 60 MW virtual PPA
with Honda for its Hokkaido wind farm. Eku Energy and Tokyo Gas also set up the first
tolling agreement for a 30 MW BESS project in Kyushu. PPA deal sizes are increasing,
with Vena Energy signing a 72 MW PPA with Yahoo/LINE for a single project.
This surge in demand is creating more job opportunities in the energy market, with
developers, offtakers, market advisors, lenders and brokerage firms all clamoring for
talent who can originate, negotiate, structure and price CPPA agreements.

Japan’s power markets is the place to be
Japan, the third-largest national energy market globally, is seeing significant growth in
power market trading, driven by increased volumes on the European Energy Exchange
(EEX), which saw almost a fourfold rise last year. Global players like InCommodities,
BP, Citadel, Engie, and Japanese megabank MUFG have entered the market, alongside a
rise in physical power trading on JEPX, spot trading, and algorithmic trading.
This surge in activity is creating more opportunities for traders, analysts, and risk
professionals, as demand for expertise in managing market volatility, trading strategies,
and risk management grows. While Japan’s market isn't as volatile as Australia’s, the
larger capacity and attractive growth potential make it a key focus for global players.

Slow and steady despite headwinds, offshore wind
Despite challenges in the global offshore wind sector, including auction delays and
high-profile market exits, the number of projects set for construction by 2030 is steadily
increasing, creating significant job opportunities.
Following a delay over Round 1’s uproar over accusations of unfair practices, the Round
2 auction had four projects totaling 1.8 GW, with a diverse range of winners, including
major trading houses, EPCOs, and foreign firms like RWE and Iberdrola. Round 3
results are now out, with the new combo of JERA+BP involved in both Akita and
Yamagata projects.

Additionally, new promotion zones in Akita, Hokkaido, and Wakayama are advancing,
with Wakayama’s floating offshore wind zone marking a key development. Floating
wind is seen as crucial to unlocking Japan’s vast offshore wind potential, possibly able
to generate hundreds of GW of power from the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ).
While rising raw material and supply chain costs continue to present challenges, the
long-term outlook remains positive, with increasing projects expected to drive job
growth across construction, manufacturing, and project management roles in the
offshore wind industry.

Solar, smaller and more distributed with local growth expected
During the FiT boom of the mid-2010s, generous subsidies led to questionable large-
scale solar projects, often built on mountainsides, displacing thousands of trees and
habitats, while incurring high civil engineering costs. With FiT prices for solar now
below ¥8/ kWh, and CPPA prices driven by market forces, such projects are no longer
economically viable or considered environmentally acceptable. Though large scale
projects are still under development, they’re increasingly scarce and competed over,
which relates to a plateau in the number of career opportunities in mega-solar.
Meanwhile, distributed solar is gaining momentum. The trend of aggregating numerous
small-scale (<2MW) plants and installing on-site solar for commercial and industrial
customers is growing rapidly. Carports, rooftops, small onsite installations as well as
agri-solar plants for crops that need higher shade, such as matcha tea, are increasing.
This is more of a market for domestic players rather than large multinational
developers, hence we see the solar increase becoming more distributed over the country
and less internationalized than over the past decade.
Big battery boom comes to Japan
Last summer, renewable generators, particularly in Kyushu and Chugoku faced
frustration, with curtailment rates reaching up to 50% in some areas. This has spurred
the development of BESS assets to absorb excess power, which has attracted a number
of new market players.

While financing pure merchant BESS projects remains challenging, and tolling
agreements are still emerging, the LTDA is driving short-term growth, with 30 projects
receiving subsidies in 2024, split between Japanese and foreign developers, and a
planned doubling of BESS allocations in 2025. More recently, 27 projects received
subsidies through the Sustainable Open Innovation Initiative that will continue to add
more flexible capacity in the coming years.
As many BESS players are active in PV solar and other power generation projects, the
demand for talent in land acquisition, project development, and project management is
growing but not at the rate of a market built from scratch. Rather, specific demand in
electrical engineering, energy procurement and market expertise creates more
opportunities for experienced professionals.

What about things that burn?
Last year, the Japanese government announced a ¥3 trillion fund to develop the
hydrogen supply chain, including a cost-for-difference (CfD) mechanism to subsidize
the gap between production and market prices, similar to the UK's model for scaling
costly new technologies. In Japan, low-carbon hydrogen includes both green and blue
hydrogen.
LNG is clearly going to be a major part of Japan’s energy mix for the foreseeable future
due to increasing demand, and a long ramp of renewables, nuclear restarts and
hydrogen/ammonia technologies reaching levels suitable for commercial scale
deployment.

This is an area where we see demand for talent plateauing, as LNG or other
hydrocarbon skilled professionals will have the opportunity to transfer to H2/ NH3
related jobs within the large Japanese trading and engineering firms that operate across
both fossil and clean-burning fuels.

China / Renewables
Chinese companies installed a record 24 GW of energy capacity in Belt & Road
countries in 2024, doubling the figure over 2023 and the highest level of investment
since the initiative was launched in 2013. According to Wood Mackenzie, 52% of the
projects were renewables, which includes 8 GW of solar power and 5 GW of
hydroelectric power. Solar energy made up 67% of clean energy capacity added in
2024.
Green hydrogen
Around 83% of the low carbon hydrogen capacity to go online in 2030 is expected to
come from green hydrogen plants, reported GlobalData. The remainder will come from
blue hydrogen, whilst purple and turquoise hydrogen capacities are anticipated to be
miniscule. Only about 2% of the total expected by 2030 is currently operational.

India / Coal imports
India lowered imports of thermal coal by over 5.5 Mt in 2024 over 2023, according to
Kpler. But India’s total coal-fired power generation hit new highs last year; lower
imports mean that higher volumes of domestic coal were burned for power instead.
India / Renewables
Reliance Power appointed Neeraj Parakh as its CEO, subject to the approval of board
members. The appointment took effect on Jan 20 and runs for three years.

Indonesia / Coal
Indonesia said that the U.S. plans to scrap a coal climate plan as Trump promotes
policies to foster fossil fuels production and consumption. The two countries are part of
the Just Energy Transition Partnership.
Malaysia / Oil
Over the next three years to 2027, Petronas aims to increase Malaysia’s oil and gas
production by about 18% to 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). As of
2024, Malaysia’s oil and gas output has averaged 1.7 million boepd.

Sri Lanka / Energy development
The World Bank will support Sri Lanka in the development of various sectors, including
energy, with plans to finance three key projects totaling $200 million.

South Korea / Microgrids
Scientists from Incheon National University have developed a new optimization model
to improve microgrid operation in response to unexpected changes in power supply and
demand. The enhanced model boosts the efficiency and reliability of microgrids and
also offers scalable solutions.
