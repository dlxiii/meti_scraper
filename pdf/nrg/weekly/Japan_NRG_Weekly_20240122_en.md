NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





JFTC cites power market practices not compliant with antitrust rules

(Government statement, Jan 17)
•  The Japan Fair Trade Commission published research on the power sector, citing practices that
may violate the Antimonopoly Act (AMA). Former regional power monopolies (EPCOs) hold a 70%
share of the electricity market, and the balance by new market entrants, also known as
independent power providers (IPPs).
•  EPCOs prohibiting IPPs from re-selling EPCO power to third parties may restrain competition and
violate the AMA. EPCOs retailing power to customers below cost is also a possible AMA violation,

the Commission pronounced.
•  The JFTC proposal included allowing IPPs wider access to EPCO power resources and data. EPCO
power facilities were not built on EPCO funds alone but were financed by various sources, the
Commission said.
•  The IPPs should negotiate with the EPCO generating unit to secure power contracts, rather than
the EPCO retail unit that’s in direct competition with the IPPs.
•  CONTEXT: The JFTC launched the research in 2022. During that time, a separate JFTC team

exposed an alleged cartel by four EPCOs – Kansai Electric, Chubu Electric, Chugoku Electric and
Kyushu Electric.
• TAKEAWAY: Companies cited for possible antitrust violations during the course of the research are not fined
but are expected to rectify their practices. The JFTC clarifying some EPCO behavior as potential AMA
violations would improve competition among the IPPs, which have complained of EPCO dumping for over a
decade but have not been able to provide sufficient evidence. Many IPPs also say JFTC has been too slow to

take action.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI approves power distribution fee schemes of EPCOs
(Government statement, Jan 17)

o  METI approved power distribution and transmission fees to be charged by regional
electric power utilities (EPCOs) to end-users and independent power providers.
o  The new fee structure takes effect April 2024.




METI proposes to produce gas from subsea methane hydrate by 2030
(Government statement, Jan 1)
•  METI proposed a revision of the Basic Ocean Strategy that addresses subsea mining for methane
and mineral resources. The govt seeks to retrieve methane hydrate solids in the sea, as well as

encourage subsea natural gas and oil production.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  During FY2023-2027, the govt will undertake exploration, data analysis, technology development,
production tests and environmental impact assessments. And then it will hand over the projects to
the private sector by FY2030.
•  METI will choose sites for exploring potential of shallow type methane hydrate along the coast of
Sakata (Yamagata Pref), Joetsu (Niigata Pref), etc.
•  METI also plans to spur oil and natural gas production in the Sea of Japan and will continue

exploration.
•  CONTEXT: Methane hydrate is an ice-like solid containing massive amounts of methane, and
found in the sea around Japan. There are two types of methane hydrate: shallow type and pore-
filling type.




MoE to survey the EEZ for offshore wind power potential
(Denki Shimbun, Jan 17)
•  The MoE is conducting a preliminary survey of offshore wind power development in the Exclusive

Economic Zone (EEZ), especially regarding the risk of bird strikes on turbine blades and impact on
the nearby area.
•  CONTEXT: Globally, Japan’s EEZ ranks sixth in terms of area. Under the Renewable Energy Sea
Area Utilization Act, the govt designates promotion areas for offshore wind power and selects
power generation operators via tenders. Application of this law, however, is limited to territorial
waters, and excludes the EEZ.
• TAKEAWAY: While the govt is eager to expand offshore wind power into the Exclusive Economic Zone, which

extends beyond territorial waters, the costs to build the necessary infrastructure currently make it doubtful that
such distant wind farms would be economically viable.




Japan to mandate disclosure of hazardous substances for PV panels
(Government statement, Jan 15)
•  New solar power plant operators will be required to use panels registered with the Japan

Photovoltaic Energy Association, which should clarify if the equipment includes hazardous
substances.
•  Panel producers will need to state whether their modules contain substances such as cadmium,
lead, arsenic and selenium, and when the panels were made.
•  The change is planned as part of an amendment to Japan’s Act on Renewable Energy Special
Measures planned for this spring.
•  METI and MoE plan similar recycling schemes for wind and other renewables.

•  CONTEXT: The move comes as Japan aims to address disposal of solar panels and pushes for their
recycling. So far, recycling companies have been struggling with processing PVs due to a lack of
information on components and their composition.

Furukawa Electric invests £10 million in UK fusion energy company
(Company statement, Jan 18)
o  Furukawa Electric invested around £10 million in Tokamak Energy, a UK fusion energy
company.
o  CONTEXT: Tokamak Energy has proposed to the United Kingdom Atomic Energy

Authority (UKAEA) a small fusion reactor consisting of an ultra-high magnetic field and
superconducting magnets of its own design. The UK firm’s design relies on a yttrium-
based high-temperature superconducting (HTS) wire made by SuperPower Inc, a
Furukawa Electric group company based in the U.S.
o  The three companies now aim to focus on further R&D to commercialize small-scale
fusion reactors. They’ll also develop high-field electromagnets. The partnership will
explore new markets for the products, including Japan.




Companies disclose emission goals on GX League website

(Government statement, Jan 16)
•  On the GX League website, 372 out of the 568 member companies disclosed long term Scope 1
and 2 emission goals and past records.
•  The FY2021 total that was reported for Scope I emissions accounted for over half of the national
total, METI said. The 2025 Scope 1 reduction goal is 620 million tons, and 480 million tons for
2030.
•  The data will be updated on a monthly basis.

• TAKEAWAY: The GX League is a group of companies collaborating with METI to design and run the carbon
credit exchange. League participation and emission disclosures are on a voluntary basis, which creates data
inconsistencies. For example, Japan’s major emitter Nippon Steel reported its FY2013 emissions, but not
FY2021. Nippon Steel is also selective in its inclusion of assets for the emission reporting. For example, it did
not include Nippon Steel Stainless Steel, which operated a coal-fired blast furnace until last year. Itochu, whose

affiliate ENEX Electric Power runs coal power plants, gave FY2021 figures but on a non-consolidated basis. The
lack of data uniformity makes comparative analysis difficult.




Biofuels: METI clarifies rice husks and straw are not for renewables
(Government statement, Jan 16)
•  METI clarified biomass power operators won’t be able to use rice husks and straw, as well as wheat

straw, as fuel, since they conflict with the food supply chains. This rule applies to operators in both
Feed-in-Tariff and Feed-in-Premium schemes.
• TAKEAWAY: Husks and straw are livestock feeds. Japan even imports straws as domestic supplies are not
enough. The govt is trying to raise the self-sufficiency of food, just like energy. Meanwhile, some farms are
considering growing crops for energy as well as food, depending on market prices.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mitsui and Brazil’s Suzano ink agreement on biomaterial
(Company statement, Jan 16)
o  Mitsui & Co, and Brazil’s Suzano agreed to study the manufacture and sales of biofuels
and other biomaterials utilizing the latter’s forest resources.
o  Suzano owns forest resources covering 2.6 mln hectares.




Obayashi Corp launches hydrogen transport trial in Fukushima

(Company statement, Jan 19)
•  Obayashi Corp launched a hydrogen trial in Namie (Fukushima Pref) to test truck transport in the
70 MPa high pressure environment instead of the usual 19.6 MPa.
•  The trial will also include a pipeline network to evaluate a new approach – using electrical cable
trenches.
•  CONTEXT: Hydrogen compresses at higher pressure, improving transport efficiency. This is

Japan’s first attempt to test its transport at 70 MPa. Obayashi will apply high pressure handling
technologies developed by Toyota Motor.
• TAKEAWAY: Obayashi produces green hydrogen at its Oita geothermal plant and has been tasked with
finding applications for green hydrogen produced at the Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field (FH2R) in
Namie. FH2R produces 200 tons /year of green hydrogen for research and plans to offer it to the market.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Rail transport cuts green hydrogen emissions by 82%: Obayashi Corp
(Company statement, Jan 15)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Obayashi Corp, which produces green hydrogen at its geothermal plant in Oita Pref,
reported emission cuts of 82% by switching to railways from trucks.
o  Transporting hydrogen from the production site in Oita to the Iwatani Corp facility in
Kobe City (Hyogo Pref.) by rail incurred emissions of just 0.062 tons of CO2 for one
journey. Truck transport emits 0.347 tons.




Perovskite startup PXP develops solar EV prototype

(Company statement, Jan 17)
•  PXP Corp, a perovskite startup, created a solar Electric Vehicle (EV) prototype with bendable
modules made of copper alloy chalcopyrite on its rooftop. PXP is still adjusting the prototype as it
conducts outdoor driving tests, and plans to upgrade the setup by placing a perovskite layer on
top of the chalcopyrite.
•  Chalcopyrite modules have a 18% power efficiency, and with a perovskite layer, the efficiency
reaches 28%, enough for a vehicle to drive 37 km/day on solar power.
•  PXP chose chalcopyrite because it’s pitch

black and hides the white linings around the
cells, improving vehicle appearance.
• TAKEAWAY: This is Japan’s second solar-EV prototype
with bendable thin modules. Last year, Sharp unveiled the
first Toyota hybrid vehicle with bendable thin solar
modules made of silicon. Sharp’s modules achieved the

world’s highest power efficiency of 33.7%. The modules
were tested on Nissan EVs as well. Storage battery
systems are key to realizing solar EV commercialization, or
cars won’t drive on rainy days.





Chugai Ro to expand equipment for all-solid-state batteries and start sales in 2026
(Nikkei, Jan 16)
•  Chugai Ro has developed manufacturing equipment for electrode materials and solid electrolytes

for all-solid-state batteries, and plans to start sales to battery parts manufacturers by 2026.
•  CONTEXT: Compared to lithium-ion batteries that use liquid electrolyte which possibly leaks, all-
solid-state batteries are safer, operate under a wider range of temperatures, etc. When used in
EVs, they are expected to improve cruising range.
• TAKEAWAY: Sales of all-solid-state-lithium ion batteries at limited volumes already started last year. One of
the manufacturers, Hitachi Zosen, told Japan NRG that it aims to launch mass production around 2026.

MOL’s ocean thermal energy conversion project in Mauritius to be commercialized
(Company statement, Jan 15)
•  Research on installation of water intake pipes by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines in Mauritius was selected by

METI to be part of a feasibility study for deep-ocean water applications to commercialize ocean
thermal energy conversion (OTEC).
•  OTEC uses the temperature difference between warm water in the surface layer and cold water in
the deep sea to generate electricity.
•  CONTEXT: Since OTEC is not impacted much by weather conditions, it can ensure stable and
predictable power output 24/7. Mitsui aims to commercialize OTEC in Japan and overseas,
including Mauritius. The project was included in METI’s FY2023 Infrastructure Development

Program for the Joint Crediting Mechanism.

Tokyu Land-led group uses snow to generate power at ski resort
(Nikkei, Jan 15)
•  The Niseko ski resort area in Hokkaido is being used as a renewable energy generation site. A
group led by Tokyu Land, a major real estate development company, joined a move to produce

power using snow.
•  Power is produced as the engine is driven by the temperature difference between the snow and
heat source. Specifically, antifreeze added to water is circulated around the hut through pipes, and
the difference between the antifreeze solution cooled by the snow and the heat from the biomass
boiler is used to generate electricity.
•  CONTEXT: The group has chosen Niseko to draw more attention to the project given the
location’s popularity with tourists from overseas.

Offshore Wind: bidding starts for Round 3 tender, 1.05 GW up for auction

(Japan NRG, Jan 19)
•  METI and MLIT began soliciting bids for two wind power projects off the coast of Yuza, Yamagata
Pref and the southern side of the Sea of Japan, off the coast of Tsugaru City and Ajigasawa Town
in southwestern Aomori Pref.
•  The govt is offering the opportunity to build a wind farm with capacity of as much as 450 MW at
the Yamagata site and as much as 600 MW at the Aomori site. Occupancy is up to 30 years.
•  The sites were designated as “promotion zones,” deemed suitable for an offshore wind farm

because they meet certain criteria, including weather and land conditions.
•  The govt welcomed public feedback on the sites from Nov 17 to Dec 17. Tender bids will be
accepted until July 19, 2024.
•  CONTEXT: To ensure coexistence with the fishing industry, offshore wind turbines can’t be
installed in waters one nautical mile from the coastline.
• TAKEAWAY: METI’s swift decision to start soliciting for Round 3 soon after concluding most of Round 2 shows
a desire to speed up the expansion of offshore wind. Only areas that are designated as “promotion zones” are

allowed to go to auction and time is of the essence, given that so far only 3.5 GW capacity has been tendered.
Those wind farms, however, might only
be operational in FY2029, if there are
no unexpected problems. For an in-
depth look at the state of the offshore
wind auctions, see this week’s Analysis
section.

•  The firm predicts the market will significantly grow especially for solar and biomass power
generation. Estimated revenue for FY2040 is ¥4.5 trillion with 25% of total electricity sales
expected to switch to renewable energy sources.
•  For corporate PPAs, the market for solar power is projected to reach ¥410 billion in FY2040,
around 10 times the FY2022 level.




Eurus Energy starts operation of wind farm in Hokkaido

(Company statement, Jan 15)
•  Eurus Energy launched its 64 MW Kawanishi Wind Farm in Hokkaido.
•  The plant, one of Japan’s largest, is the third built under the firm’s Dohoku Wind Power Generation
Project, which will have a total of 107 turbines across six wind farms.
•  The project uses 15 Siemens Gamesa turbines (each 4.3 MW). The electricity generated will be
sold to Hokkaido Electric.
•  CONTEXT: Last year, due to Hokkaido’s insufficient transmission line capacity, Eurus and partners

set up North Hokkaido Wind Energy Transmission to operate govt-subsidized, large-scale power
grid and storage battery facilities in the area.




MoE minister comments on J-Power’s Hisatsu wind farm impact report
(Government statement, Jan 19)
•  The MoE minister advised J-Power to take note of noise, water, and bird life impact at the site for
the 129 MW Hisatsu wind farm in Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefs.
•  J-Power plans to build 30 turbines (each 4.3 MW). Turbine No. 14 and No. 16 were identified as
planned in locations potentially harmful to black eagles.

•  CONTEXT: The Hisatsu project environmental impact assessment started in 2020. Last month, the
Kumamoto governor asked J-Power to revise the project as the measures to prevent floods and
impact of heavy rain were absent in the preparatory impact report. The company needs to file a
formal report reflecting these comments. METI will make a final decision based on the final report.




J-POWER to revamp coal plant with IGCC, mull biomass, hydrogen, CCS options
(Nikkei, Jan 11)
•  J-POWER is exploring a number of options to revamp its coal-fired Matsushima Thermal Power
Plant, which sits on the island of Saikai, Nagasaki Pref, about 2km from the mainland.

•  The utility will shutter the two coal-firing units by the end of FY2024. The first unit (500 MW) will be
decommissioned.
•  The second 500-MW unit will be revamped using Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle
(IGCC) technology, which involves steaming and burning coal to extract a mixture of carbon
monoxide and hydrogen gas, which is then used to rotate turbines to generate electricity. A boiler

Japan moving away from Russian energy: Analyst

(Japan NRG, Jan 17)
•  In 2024, energy commodity prices will ease from 2023 but supply uncertainties will limit their fall.
Meanwhile, Japan is expected to buy less energy from Russia, said Ito Toshinori of Ito Research &
Advisory at a Tokyo Commodity Exchange event.
•  Ito noted a sharp decrease in energy imports from Russia, whose 2021 crude oil sales to Japan
were 5.242 mln kiloliters (33 mln barrels or 3.6% of total Japan imports) but fell to 2.287 mln
kiloliters (1.5%) in 2022.
•  Russian thermal coal imports halved — 13.7 Mt (12.2%) in 2021 became 7.87 Mt (6.8%) in 2022. As

for LNG, 2021 imports from Russia were 6.57 Mt (8.8%), while in 2022 they rose to 6.87 Mt (9.5%).
•  CONTEXT: At the end of 2023, Russian thermal coal was 3% of Japan’s total coal imports. Japan
relies mostly on Australia for coal, but due to high prices, Japan will try to balance that more with
purchases from countries like Indonesia. Japan's need for LNG will also largely depend on whether

Japan’s Offshore Wind Sector Poised for
Fast Growth Amid Unexpected Obstacles

After a slow start and some early setbacks, Japan’s efforts to build offshore wind
power generation – literally from the ground up – are finally gaining traction. With
only six years remaining to meet 2030 interim clean energy goals, the government is
seeking to accelerate the rollout of wind energy.

It took over two years to host Round 1 wind auctions (1.7 GW) and then adjust the
tender rules to satisfy most industry players. In contrast, by the end of this year METI
hopes to have selected developers for over 2.4 GW of capacity within 13 months.

Equally important, the industry’s reaction to the Round 2 results, announced last
month, was strong enough to start the bidding process for Round 3 a month later. On
Friday, January 19, METI began soliciting bids for two areas off Yamagata and Aomori
Prefectures, with a total capacity of 1.05 GW.

While officials hesitate to put a timeframe on subsequent tenders beyond this year’s
Round 3, preparatory work on zoning and other regulations is in progress. Also, the
frequency of policy meetings at METI on offshore wind has increased, mainly to cover
floating offshore wind tech that will be vital for the development of deeper waters to
which the industry will shift focus in the 2030s.

To maintain the momentum, Japan’s government will need to provide offshore wind
projects plenty of support as the industry finds itself in a challenging position. Supply
chain disruptions, high interest rates and rising costs for steel and critical metals have
stalled projects across the globe. Japanese firms active in offshore wind in Taiwan
have recently announced project exits or hinted at such action.

In this complex environment, METI and industry players find themselves dependent
on each other for the success of the local wind sector. Officials need to hit their target
of auctioning 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by FY2030 and hope that a portion will
be operational. Japanese waters offer the industry a fresh start in a country short of
green electricity options.

Slow start
In 2022, Japan’s installed power capacity was estimated at 335 GW. Renewables
accounted for about 22.7% of that, up from 16% of the total in 2015. In terms of
volume, however, solar’s share was 10% of the nation’s mix, while wind power
provided less than 1%.

By 2030, the current national strategy states that renewables are due to account for
36-38% of Japan’s energy mix. That target looks increasingly doubtful, but the
government believes that progress in offshore wind and next-generation solar tech
will put the country in a position to quickly build up its renewable energy portfolio in
the latter part of this decade.

The rollout of offshore wind alone is supposed to accelerate from 10 GW in 2030 to as
much as 45 GW in 2040 – should floating wind turbines become a commercial reality.
To expand the pipeline, METI plans to boost the capacity it auctions each year to an
average of 2-3 GW from about 2030.

The current status of the sector, however, is anemic. At the end of 2022, Japan had
just 4.8 GW of total wind capacity, of which 98% was onshore. Offshore facilities
totalled just 135 MW, data by the Japan Wind Power Association show.

The offshore wind sector was supposed to take off back in 2021 when METI hosted
Round 1 auctions, but the fact that officials awarded all three fixed-bottom turbine
tenders to consortia led by Mitsubishi Corp led to an uproar. Accusations of favoritism
prompted the government to revise the rules in order to ensure a fair playing field, a
discussion with industry and academic experts that lasted over a year.


The winners of the three tenders from Round 2, announced in December 2023, were a
lot more varied, with a non-Japanese company part of a winning consortium for the
first time. A fourth tender for a project in Aomori Prefecture, with 350 MW in capacity,
will be announced in March.

More good news followed on January 1 when JERA and Green Power Investment
(GPI) announced the commercial launch of the country’s first large-scale offshore wind
farm, off Hokkaido coast, in Ishikari Bay (112 MW. Hokkaido Electric will buy the
project’s entire output over 20 years. Shimizu Corp and Nippon Steel Engineering
were responsible for the construction.

Promising zones vs. Promotion zones
Zoning is the key to the next stage. Site selection and feasibility studies are the first
steps in building an offshore wind farm. The government identifies potential locations
with favorable wind conditions, and conducts feasibility studies to assess the site’s
environmental, technical, and economic viability. These include currents, depth and
condition of the sea bottom. Also, the interests of local stakeholders, such as
fishermen and nearby ports with their maritime traffic, must be considered.

To this end, the government designates marine areas suitable for offshore wind power
generation and assigns them into three categories:
•  Preparation zones
•  Promising zones, and

19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Promotion zones.

Only promotion zones can be offered for offshore wind projects and, currently, all of
Japan’s existing “promotion zones” have been auctioned via Round 1 and Round 2,
or are attracting bidders in Round 3. A successful auction bidder has the right to
exclusively use their specified area for up to 30 years.

Today, there are nine zones in the category immediately preceding “promotion”. To
make sure there are enough projects for the next auctions, METI began to speed up
the elevation of “promising” areas into “promotion” ones.

ANRE, the energy agency under METI’s auspices, recently upgraded the status of five
areas to “promising,” one step ahead of the “promotion” stage. These are waters off
the coast of Ganu-Minamishiribeshi, Hiyama, Ishikari, Shimamaki and Matsumae – all
towns and cities on the island of Hokkaido. The government concluded that there’s
sufficient grid capacity to accept connections from wind farms in those zones.

Promotion zones placed up for auction in Round 1, 2 and 3:

Facing the obstacles
Once the likely zones are established, operators need to carry out their own
assessment of the sea, wind and other conditions to consider whether they can create
a profitable wind farm in the area. One other consideration, however, is which ports
the developer will need to use to build the project.
With so many of the initial promising zones clustered in nearby areas of northern
Japan, the number of ports that they can use is limited. Already, one of the tenders
from Round 2 (the Happo-Noshiro project in Akita Prefecture) was delayed from
December 2023 to March 2024 after officials saw that its construction schedule and

port utilization plans overlapped with that of other wind farms. The ports in question
are Akita Port and Noshiro Port, which could serve ships working in the Happo-
Noshiro and Oga-Katagami-Akita areas.

As a result, METI has asked the bidders for the Happo-Noshiro project to revise their
plans to take into account the logistical constraints.

Securing qualified and motivated workers is another critical issue for the industry. In
2030 alone it’s estimated that wind farm operators will need to hire as many as 15,700
engineers and other highly skilled staff. By 2040, that figure will rise to over 38,200
qualified operators.

The government is aware of the problem. To address it, it has contracted a
consortium comprising shipping firm Nippon Yusen and Nippon Kaiyo, a surveying
services provider, to establish a training center for marine crew and operators of
offshore wind power plants in Oga, Akita Prefecture. The center, which will accept
1,000 trainees per year, is slated to open in April.

Other obstacles are still awaiting resolution, especially around permitting. In order for
more offshore wind projects to come online by 2030, the government may need to
shorten the bidding and assessment periods to allow vendors more time to meet
other requirements and gain approvals from local communities.


Each project already requires as much as eight years to execute even after a bid is
finalized. The preliminary review alone takes more than one year and the
environmental impact assessment may take between four to six years.

Round 3
After the Round 2 announcement, Japan quickly moved into Round 3 tenders, which
focus on the south side of the Sea of Japan – off Aomori Prefecture, and the seas off
Yuza Town in Yamagata Prefecture. The total capacity of those projects is 1.05 GW.

Draft guidelines for Round 3 were released in November and the government opened
it to public comment. Developers will be able to submit plans until July 19, 2024;
results are expected this calendar year. Most results of the previous rounds were
announced in December.

The level of interest in Round 3 will be a significant factor in understanding just how
much risk domestic and international wind developers are willing to take. With costs
for offshore wind rising, and projects canceled in other countries, Japan will have to
find a way to buck that trend and find cost efficient solutions.

The government won’t be able to act solely as judge and arbiter. As developers
pioneer offshore wind’s unchartered waters, the burden will be on government
officials to stimulate construction and reassure investors about the sector’s long-term
viability.

What You Need to Know Before Trialing Perovskite Solar Tech
A few years ago, Perovskite solar cells (PSC) were a technology confined to technical
papers. Yet in 2023, this bendable, lightweight material swiftly progressed from the
lab stage to demonstration tests, the success of which should allow it to emerge as a
viable and commercial option for decarbonization.


Interest in PSC has emerged at a wide range of Japanese firms. Companies as diverse
as Toyota Motor and new-age farming startup Notas are sourcing PSC modules to
explore how they can be integrated into the business, and what impact it will have on
their green power portfolio and emissions.

However, the rush to revolutionize industry through this more flexible next-generation
solar technology is also uncovering some of the limitations of PSC, at least in the form
that it exists today. Much like the AI revolution in business processes, there are great
aspirations but also great challenges in achieving Japan’s goal of commercializing the
PSC sector within two years.

As the number of field trials of glass-mounted PSC modules rises, Japan NRG spoke
to consultants at various projects to discuss how the technology was performing and
what issues have emerged.
(See the table below for a list of major PSC field trials).

PSC impact on buildings
A year ago, there was just one PSC demo, and companies were helping the demos as
a corporate social initiative. Today, demo projects are proliferating and certain trends
have become clear.

Walls are popular spots for PSC installations; at least 13 out of 19 demo projects in
Japan use building and facility walls and windows. PSC modules are light, and
prototype modules that are over one-meter squared in size are now being developed,
allowing installations in wide areas.

Construction consultants, however, point out that wall installations may be at odds
with energy efficiency measures currently in place. That’s partly because of the heat
released during power generation. Whether PSC modules are printed on thin films, or
mounted on glass or metal sheets, they release heat when generating electricity.

One scientist told Japan NRG that the temperatures of PSC modules will be the same,
or lower than those of other commercially available solar modules made of silicon.
This means that module temperatures could rise to 80°C on hot summer days when
outdoor air temperature is in the mid-30s°C.

The 80°C threshold suggests that direct installations of PSC-printed films on walls may
require caution, depending on what the wall is made of. Many buildings deploy
thermal insulation materials made of petrochemicals. The melting point for
polyurethane foam, which is used for wall insulation, is 200°C, but at around 92°C it
already starts to degrade quickly. Some consultants at PSC projects today say that at
80°C the performance of building materials tends to suffer.


Wooden commercial buildings are rare today, but their numbers are rising due to
concern about concrete’s environmental impact. Japan is keen to promote the
consumption of cross-laminated timber (CLT) as a concrete alternative, thus reducing
construction’s carbon footprint. When combined with PSC, however, the results are
troubling.

Wood rots faster when exposed to heat. Depending on the heat intensity, PSC
modules placed on walls, for example, may speed up wall erosion, which in a worst-
case scenario could lead to the collapse of the entire building.

In most current demos, PSC is mounted on metal or glass sheets to fix its module in
position. Although PSC modules are lightweight, it cannot be assumed that they have
no impact on the building's structural integrity.

Meanwhile, glass-integrated PSC modules may block direct sunlight into a building,
requiring more power for indoor lighting.

What happens if PSC breaks?
During demos, some modules break and the broken pieces are gathered for analysis.
If the pieces and chemical elements are blown or washed away by rain this is a
problem because PSCs contain lead. The impact on the environment is still not clear.

Disposal of the end-of-life PSC modules is another gray area. Sigma Aldrich Japan, a
supplier of perovskite raw materials, says that users need to consult with municipalities
on disposal.

Some researchers said they follow guidelines for chemical disposals at their respective
institutions. Such guidelines say the material should be separated according to types
and sent to contracted waste processing companies for disposal.

No data, no life
The biggest concern is a lack of data. Most of the research into PSC properties so far
has been in lab conditions or with a narrow focus, and that has limited application in
outdoor operating environments.

For example, several PSC researchers said they did not measure and monitor module
temperatures during power generation because this aspect was outside of their R&D
focus – which was to improve power efficiency.

For researchers, the main scope of work has been to find ways to scale up the module
sizes, make PSC more efficient, explore automated production processes, and
improve module endurance.


On the other hand, as the technology moves into practical use companies want
information about best installation practices, system deployment, and operational
know-how.

The government’s desire to protect Japanese IP in this burgeoning sector is leading
to other kinds of information gaps. One construction firm was approached by an
affiliate of a company developing PSC modules to ask about collaborating on demo
projects. But the affiliate couldn’t disclose much about the modules in question,
making evaluation of joint work nearly impossible.

“We were not shown the actual PSC modules. We were not given data. So, how do
they expect us to make a project agreement without knowing what it is?” said an
official at the construction firm.

Japan faces a fine balancing act in PSC development. METI’s desire to promote it as a
sector of national importance, with restrictions on information sharing related to
module manufacturing, makes sense due to intense international competition.

But it’s also important to offer technical transparency, for example, regarding
installation in order to ensure healthy industry growth.

As with a lot of technologies, certain data sharing will be needed to encourage wide
adoption of PSC across business sectors. It will benefit society if the results of field
trials are disclosed and shared with the public.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

ASEAN / Wind and solar
The operating utility-scale solar and wind capacity of ASEAN countries rose 20% YoY
in 2023 to reach over 28 GW, led by Vietnam that had the largest operating utility-
scale solar and wind capacity with 19 GW, followed by the Philippines and Thailand,
with 3 GW each, reports Global Energy Monitor.

China / CRMs
EV maker BYD has held talks about a potential takeover of Brazilian lithium producer,
Sigma Lithium, in a deal valued at $2.9 billion. Backed by Warren Buffett, BYD
recently overtook Tesla as the world’s largest EV manufacturer.

India / Wind and solar power
Avaada Group and the Gujarat govt signed a MoU to develop 6 GW of hybrid wind
and solar power projects with an investment of around $4.8 billion. Avaada said the
projects will be built mostly in the underdeveloped wastelands of Kutch.

Indonesia / EVs
BYD will invest $1.3 billion in an EV factory in Indonesia. The Chinese carmaker
unveiled three new models with the aim of becoming Indonesia’s biggest EV brand.
The site would be the sixth auto plant planned outside China — following Brazil,
Hungary, Mexico, Thailand and Uzbekistan.

LNG
Projects capable of producing 140 mtpa are set to come onstream between 2025 and
2027, according to Bernstein. That’s more than 30% of the current market. A further
190 mtpa of gas projects is also under consideration well into the next decade.

Nuclear power
Asia Pacific's nuclear power sector expanded, reaching 132 GW of capacity in
operation; also 48 GW of capacity is under construction, and 91 GW is in the planning
stage. APAC is followed by Europe with 119 GW in operational capacity, 10 GW in
construction, and 37 GW in planning.

Offshore wind
Total offshore wind investments that closed in 2023 reached a record 12.3 GW, a
rebound from the 0.8 GW that reached a final investment decision (FID) in 2022. Asia
Pacific accounted for 2.3 GW of projects that reached FID, mostly in Taiwan and South
Korea.

Oman / Solar power
The govt has issued a tender for the 500 MW Ibri III Solar IPP farm. The project will
need investment of about $403 million, and is expected to start operations by Q1 of
2024.

Philippines and Indonesia
President Marcos and President Widodo signed a MoU to boost cooperation in the
energy sector amidst supply constraints on coal and LNG. The Philippines depends on
Indonesia for coal, sourcing 98% of its total from the country in 2022.

Shipping
The re-routing of a growing number of ships around Africa to avoid attacks in the Red
Sea is altering refueling patterns. Ships are topping up more at the ports of Singapore
and Rotterdam, the two busiest bunkering ports and where fuel is competitively
priced.
