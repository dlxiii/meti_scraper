ANRE to prevent unauthorized data access by power operators, EGC also probes this issue
(Japan NRG, March 1)
•  ANRE began work on measures to keep regional power companies from accessing the customer
data of new market players connecting to the grid. Separate from ANRE, the Electricity and Gas
Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) is probing this issue.
•  ANRE is reviewing the effect of separations of different operational units, data management

required, governance and market competition issues.
•  Members of the Electricity and Gas Basic Policy Sub Committee called for more rigid separation
between the power system operation and other units of regional utilities. One panelist urged a
review of the EGC as well, since it failed to spot incompliance although it had been monitoring the
activities of different units after the 2020 separation.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Task force calls to separate ownership of transmission companies from
EPCOs, violators might see license revoked
(Denki Shimbun, March 3)
o  The Task Force for regulation of Renewable Energy, which is under the Cabinet, required

EPCOs to separate ownership of their power transmission companies; this is in response
to recent unlawful computer access issues by the EPCOs.
o  With reference to the Electricity Business Act, the Task Force requested to cancel the
license of power transmission companies that lack compliance.
o  They also accused the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) of
failing to detect the issue beforehand.
• TAKEAWAY: Separating transmission companies is a first important step to prevent further such abuses and

unlawful access; but this might not be so feasible due to the proprietary right issue of power transmission
equipment.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Tohoku Electric scandal: Unauthorized access to customer information worse than thought
(Nikkei, March 1)
o  Tohoku Electric said 214 people gained illegal access to customer data — on 36,980
occasions — from their power management company Tohoku Electric Power Network.
o  Also, there were 9,402 incidents of illegal access by 75 employees at two contractors.
o  In January the company said the number was 130, but then corrected that figure upon

further investigation.

Cabinet submits proposed amendments of nuclear and renewable laws to parliament
(Government statement, Feb. 28)
•  The Kishida Cabinet submitted to the Diet amendments for nuclear and renewable energy laws, to
allow NPPS to operate beyond 40 years, to mandate renewable operators to communicate their

plans with local stakeholders ahead of plant construction, etc.
• TAKEAWAY: Kishida made it clear that the state will be responsible for satisfying demands of stakeholders in
communities affected by nuclear projects. In contrast, renewable operators, including offshore wind stations in
EEZ, are responsible for striking agreements with the various stakeholders themselves.



JCM to expand to multilateral GHG reduction projects
(Japan NRG, March 1)
•  Joint Crediting Mechanism, a system to transfer carbon offset credits to Japan from overseas, will
be expanded to include projects involving multiple countries.
•  Takahashi Yasuo, the executive director of Institute for Global Environmental Strategy (IGES), told a

sustainability law forum in Tokyo that governments are discussing rules on dividing the offset
credits among several countries. Presently, credit transfers are bilateral undertakings between
Japan and a partner country.
•  JCM’s principle remains unchanged – providing decarbonizing tech to developing nations. The
transfer of credits from industrialized economies to Japan will be implemented in a framework
separate from JCM, Takahashi added.
•  CONTEXT: Many carbon capture and storage and carbon recycling projects are planned in North

America and Australia. Project participants have been seeking expansion of the JCM framework to
include industrialized economies.
• TAKEAWAY: Use of market mechanisms such as the JCM have been an important part of Japan’s GHG
reduction strategy since the days of the Kyoto Protocol. One reason why Japan puts a strong focus on earning
credits from decarbonization projects in developing economies is that project costs are likely to be lower
there.




J-Credit recognizes rice field drying as GHG reduction method

(Government statement, March 1)
•  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said rice field drying was added to the GHG
reduction methodology of the J-Credit carbon offset system.
•  From mid-April, rice farmers that extend the field drying period by seven days or more from the
past two-year period will be awarded GHG offset credits.
•  CONTEXT: For one to two weeks, water in the rice fields is removed to prevent weeds growing
and to strengthen the roots of rice plants. This process also cuts methane emissions. Rice fields

account for over 40% of Japan’s total methane emissions.

METI drafts resource recycling action plan
(Japan NRG, Feb. 27)
•  METI drafted a resource recycling action plan called the Growth Oriented and Self-sufficient
Resource Economy Strategy to drive recycling.

Sharing information on raw materials used
recycle
Making one’s contribution to sustainable Possibly providing benefits to parties making significant
economy more visual       contributions in circular economy
•  METI plans to strengthen surveys of critical resources and include ambitious recycling projects to

the GX financing program.
•  The goal is to double the recycling capacity of spent batteries and electronic scrap and plastics by
2030.
•  CONTEXT: The size of the recycled materials market, dubbed “circular market”, is estimated to
now be ¥50 trillion and will grow to ¥80 trillion by 2030, according to METI’s plan.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is a global technology leader in the recycling of platinum group metals, which are used as

catalysts to speed up hydrogen and ammonia chemical reactions. However, due to high labor costs of
collecting and sorting scrap, Japan relies on China, Southeast Asia and Russia for materials that are not as
highly priced as platinum, such as recycled aluminum alloys.



Municipalities declaring net zero now cover 99% of country’s population
(Japan NRG, Feb. 28)
•  The number of municipalities pledging to be carbon neutral by 2050 hit 831; they cover 99% of the
Japanese population, according to the MoE.
•  However, few municipalities have set detailed roadmaps to net zero and the MoE has launched a
promotional zone program that will serve as a model for others.

•  The municipalities in the program will set roadmaps by 2025. They are also required to name
businesses operating in their areas as project partners.
• TAKEAWAY: Community conflicts caused by renewable projects have resulted in tighter regulations on
renewables operators, but the MoE plans to drive sustainable energy development at municipal levels.

METI to promote overseas geothermal power generation
(Nikkei, Feb. 26)
•  METI will promote exploratory drilling companies participating in overseas projects, possibly in
Indonesia and New Zealand, where INPEX is considering expansion of existing geothermal power

plants and new geological surveys.
•  ¥630 million is included in the FY2023 budget. JOGMEC will provide funding.
•  The international cooperation will help METI to gain the knowledge and know-how necessary for
geothermal power generation technology.
• TAKEAWAY Many suitable sites for geothermal power are in national or national sponsored parks, and thus
development is slow. According to METI, geothermal power related sources in Japan have a capacity potential

of 23 GW, one of the world’s biggest. However, current geothermal power capacity is only 600 MW, 0.3% of
Japan’s total power. This is why METI has been working to revise the regulation since 2021.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan to lend Indonesian utility PLN $200 mn for renewable energy

(Asia Nikkei, March 3)
o  Japanese banks are due to lend $200 million to Indonesian state-owned power utility
PLN as part of a Tokyo-backed effort to speed a transition from coal to renewable
energy.
o  Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) was due to sign an MoU with PLN as
part of the Asia Zero Emission Community initiative.
o  CONTEXT: PLN, or Perusahaan Listrik Negara, plans no new coal-fired power plants and

will replace existing ones with solar and geothermal plants from 2025.


Government orders new strategy to accelerate development of nuclear fusion
(Denki Shimbun, Mar. 2)
•  The Council of Advisers on How to Develop Nuclear Fusion Technology called for a strategy to

develop nuclear fusion by April 2023.
•  Next, the Cabinet will discuss more specific roadmaps both for nuclear fusion technology
development and for suppliers.
•  The government decided to "realize fusion power generation as early as possible" instead of the
previous vague goal of “around 2050”.
• TAKEAWAY: The GX calls for completing a detailed design for a prototype nuclear fusion reactor by 2030 and
construction by 2050. Other nuclear tech, such as next-gen PWR / BWR, SMR, fast reactor and HTGR (high

temperature gas-cooled reactor), are all scheduled to start operation before mid 2040s. Thus, nuclear fusion
will be the last of the new technologies to start generating electricity.



Cabinet approves 60+ year operation of NPP reactors
(Nikkei, Feb. 28)
•  The Cabinet approved laws to allow operation of NPP reactors for more than 60 years. A suite of
laws, including the Electricity Business Act and Atomic Energy Fundamental A, would be amended
under this cabinet decision.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  This is a big change to the rule that was decided after the Fukushima disaster, which set maximum
operation years for reactors as “Originally 40 years, but can be extended for 20 years if approved
by the NRA (40 + 20 = 60)”.
•  Under the new rule, the original operation year is lessened to 30 years, but a three-time extension
of 10 years each is possible. Moreover, the reactors are allowed to exclude the period of time they

were forced to stop by the government; therefore, this is the equation being used: (30 + 10 + 10 +
10 + stopped years).
• TAKEAWAY: While it's true that this amendment offers relief for utilities, since many reactors are already aged,
early replacement may be required for both sound management and stable supply.




Tokyo Gas and Sumitomo subsidiary developed Japan’s first H2-firing reheating burner
(Company statement, Feb. 28)
•  Tokyo Gas and Sunray Reinetsu, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Electric, developed Japan’s first
reheating burner for a hydrogen-firing gas turbine cogeneration system.
•  By combining this product with a gas turbine that generates power using 100% hydrogen, it will

realize zero CO2 emissions from the entire gas turbine cogeneration system. It also reduces NOx
emissions to the same level as city gas.
•  CONTEXT: Gas turbine cogeneration systems with a supplementary burner can increase the
amount of steam generated by waste heat boilers by further heating its own exhaust.



CO2 marine transportation to be tested next year at Maizuru power station
(Yomiuri Shimbun, March 2)
•  Japan's first demo to transport liquefied CO2 by ship will begin in 2024 at KEPCO’s Maizuru
thermal power station. The aim is to solve problems such as temperature control during
transportation and establish stable transport technology by FY2026.
•  CO2 storage facilities will be built at the Maizuru power station and in Tomakomai (Hokkaido). The
facilities will be linked by cargo ship. Total cost is about ¥16 billion.

• TAKEAWAY: Japan aims to put technology for capturing and storing CO2 into practical use by 2030. The
storage sites are expected to be mainly underground on the seabed, but proper management of temperature
and pressure will be necessary to safely transport liquefied CO2.



Mitsui subscribes to bond issue for Hexagon Purus, leading hydrogen tank manufacturer
(Company statement, March 2)
•  Mitsui will subscribe to about ¥6.5 billion in convertible bonds of Norway's Hexagon Purus, one of
the world's largest hydrogen tank manufacturers. The two companies will promote new businesses
related to vehicle electrification.
•  Hexagon Purus is a subsidiary of Hexagon Composites, in which Mitsui has invested since 2016.

•  CONTEXT: Mitsui has developed compressed hydrogen that is used in Europe and the U.S. as fuel
for fuel cell vehicles (FCEV) and for land transportation of hydrogen.

MOL and Methanex completed the first net-zero voyage fueled by bio-methanol
(Company statement, Feb. 28)
•  Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and Methanex announced that the dual-fuel vessel, “Cajun Sun,”
successfully completed the first-ever, net-zero trans-Atlantic voyage fueled by bio-methanol.

(Video in English, link https://youtu.be/U9G4Ym9qNEg)
•  The use of methanol as an alternative marine fuel was pioneered in 2016 by Waterfront Shipping
partnering with Methanex, MOL, and others. A net-zero voyage means the total GHG emissions
measured on a lifecycle basis, including the avoided emissions that occurred during bio-methanol
production.
•  MOL plans to further develop bio-methanol to decarbonize marine shipping.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

MOL and Air Water studies use of liquefied bio-methane as marine fuel
(Company statement, Feb. 22)
o  Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and Air Water signed an MoU to study the use of liquefied bio-
methane (LBM) that’s derived from cattle manure for use in LNG fueled vessels. Air Water
produces LBM in Hokkaido and supplies MOL.
o  This study is part of an LBM R&D program approved by the MoE. The two companies will

verify if LBM can be transported, supplied, and used with the existing shore and onboard
equipment. If successful, this will be Japan’s first use of LBM as marine fuel.
o  Methane is the main component of LBM and LNG, and the current LNG supply chains
can be used. LBM reduces CO2 emissions more than LNG does.



“K” LINE trials use of B24 marine biofuel supplied by BP to JFE Steel’s bulker

(Company statement, Feb. 22)
•  Kawasaki Kisen (“K” LINE) conducted a trial use of B24 marine biofuel blended with very low sulfur
fuel oil supplied by BP to the capesize bulker, “Cape Tsubaki” that’s chartered by JFE Steel Corp.
•  The biofuel was stored for two months in a tank and used during the voyage from Ponta da
Madeira to Japan. No problems were reported. The blended fuel is expected to achieve a 80-90%
reduction in GHG emission from fuel generation to consumption, without changing current engine

specifications.



IHI begins studies on green ammonia business in India
(Company statement, Feb. 21)
•  IHI signed a MoU with ACME, a leading renewable energy company in India, to study the
feasibility of producing and utilizing green ammonia derived from renewable energy.
•  IHI is mulling green ammonia projects led by ACME, in Oman, India, the U.S., and Egypt. IHA is

also studying ammonia co-firing in thermal power plants in India to contribute to early
implementation of ammonia fuel and decarbonization.

Winter power demand down from last year on warmer temperatures, power saving
(Japan NRG, March 1)
•  ANRE said power demand slid from December to February due to warmer temperatures and
power saving efforts on the back of rising prices: December demand was down 1%; January down
5%; and the first three weeks of February were down 9%.
•  On January 25-31, temperatures were the lowest in the last five years and power demand rose 6%.

But there was no critical power shortage.
•  Consumption by households and businesses decreased due to power conservation.



METI to make utilities resubmit data for price hikes appeal

(Asahi Shimbun, March 1)
•  METI will review the latest data on foreign exchange rates and fuel import prices, which are the
basis for the electricity prices increase. This will help to reduce the electricity price hikes that seven
major power companies have requested.
•  As the yen and fuel prices become more stable, METI believes it will be possible to limit the price
increase and will ask companies to resubmit their most recent data.
•  The electricity rates under discussion are 'regulated fees' that require government approval.
Companies plan to raise rates by an average of 28-45%.




Regulator ruling helps Hokuriku Electric’s reactor move closer to a restart
(NHK, March 3)
•  Nuclear regulator said that Hokuriku Electric’s Shika NPP does not sit on an active geological fault
line. That is a shift in NRA’s opinion from seven years ago, when it stated it as a possibility and thus
started a years-long review of the geology.

•  CONTEXT: The NRA’s previous assessment required Unit 1 of the station to be decommissioned
and Unit 2 to undergo major modifications.
•  The utility presented evidence using a new evaluation method using the state of minerals in the
soil to show they have not been disturbed by a fault. The data presented by Hokuriku Electric has
convinced the NRA, the regulator said.
• TAKEAWAY: Hokuriku Electric has not even applied to restart Unit 1 of Shika NPP, but it did do so for Unit 2 in

2014. This ruling suggests that a Unit 2 restart is now looking more likely. However, the NRA is yet to conclude
a host of other reviews around the safety of the site, so the regulatory approval is still a way off.

Kyushu Electric will consolidate renewable energy capacity with subsidiary Kyuden Mirai
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 28)
•  Kyushu Electric will consolidate its renewable energy business with its subsidiary Kyuden Mirai
Energy. Firstly, geothermal will be transferred in April 2024, and hydro capacity will follow.

•  Kyuden Mirai owns a total of 100 MW of renewables capacity, including wind, solar and biomass
power. After the consolidation, Kyushu says its renewable energy assets will total 1.6 GW, making
it Japan’s second largest renewables operator. This capacity breaks down as follows: 50% hydro,
21% biomass, 14% wind, 9% geothermal, and 6% solar.
•  By 2030, the company’s renewables capacity will almost double to 5 GW.




INPEX buys Mitsubishi’s 16.7% stake in 950 MW Scottish offshore wind farm
(Denki Shimbun, March 3)
•  INPEX, Japan's largest oil and gas exploration and production company, acquired Mitsubishi’s
16.7% stake in the Moray East offshore wind farm in Scotland, which began operation in April 2022
and consists of one hundred 9.5 MW wind turbines.
•  Other Moral East shareholders include Kansai Electric, EDP Renewables and ENGIE.
• TAKEAWAY: One reason why INPEX is keen to develop offshore wind is because the technology has much in

common with drilling for oil and gas. This is the company’s third offshore wind project; the other two are in the
Netherlands and were acquired last year.




Baseload power auction fetches higher prices
(Government data, Feb. 27)
•  The Jan 31 baseload power auction closed at ¥25.30/ kWh for east Japan; and ¥20/ kWh for west
Japan; compared to ¥14.87/ kWh and 14.50/ kWh a year ago. There was no settlement for the
Hokkaido area.
•  The transactions totaled 280 GWh for delivery in April 2023-March 2024, down from 510 GWh a

year ago.
•  CONTEXT: Baseload power auctions are held four times a year. This was the last auction for the
current fiscal term.
• TAKEAWAY: Out of the 280 GWh transacted, 270 GWh were in west Japan. East Japan is seeing limited
activity possibly due to a lack of nuclear power online. If the restart of TEPCO’S Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP Unit 7
is delayed after the October timeline set out by the company, it will have ripple effects beyond the Tokyo

utility. The baseload market may not be functional at all.


METI to discuss baseload market contracts longer than 1-year

(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 28)
•  At the System Design Working Group of the Advisory Committee METI said it began discussion
around introducing contracts longer than one year for the baseload market.
•  Under the present rule, baseload contracts cover following-year generation at nuclear, large hydro
and coal-fired power plants owned by EPCOs. The main buyers are new power market players.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  If the contract term is extended beyond a year, then fuel price volatility could be higher. Thus, the
working group presented two ideas to reduce risk: 1) allow fixing the price at the time when the
year changes, and 2) add a system to adjust prices automatically.
• TAKEAWAY: In 2019, Japan launched the baseload market to secure electricity at affordable cost and bridge
the imbalance between EPCOs (which own large power plants) and new power market players (which often

own small plants or none at all). The system was meant to ensure that EPCOs supply a certain amount of
electricity to the baseload market. However, prices are not always as low as expected. Officials hope that a
change to market design can improve its liquidity and operation.



ANRE mulls auction alternatives for backup power supplies
(Japan NRG, Feb. 27)
•  ANRE seeks alternatives to auctions for securing backup power supplies, due to a lack of
consistency in its availability.
•  One possibility is to float a tender with a wide selection criterion including non-price factors, and

another is selecting suppliers without a formal bidding process if potential suppliers are limited.
•  CONTEXT: Backup power is positioned as a long-term source that complements the capacity
market. The power type, size, launch schedules, management organization, and financial rules have
yet to be decided.


Tokyo Gas allocates about ¥215 billion in investments for wind power, climate tech

(Company statement, Feb. 22)
•  Tokyo Gas announced a ¥1 trillion investment plan for the FY2023-2025 period focused on green
transformation (GX). Of that money, ¥650 billion will go into so-called growth investments.
•  One-third of the growth investments are in decarbonization fields. In particular, the utility will focus
on wind power; its capacity will reach 2.2 GW by 2025, up from the current level of 1.5 GW.
•  The company plans an annual 12-million-ton reduction of CO2 by FY2025. This includes using
more “carbon neutral LNG (CNL)” and developing a global e-methane supply chain on a

commercial scale.
•  CONTEXT: In early February, Tokyo Gas said it would start a study for a 30 MW floating wind farm
off Fukushima Prefecture’s coast, aiming to start operations in 2027. In addition, Chiba and Ibaraki
prefectures are also considered.



EPCOs still supply power to corporate clients that switched to new power market players

(Nikkei, Feb. 28)
•  Around 41,000 corporate clients which had switched their power supplier from EPCOs to cheaper
new market players, and saw those go bankrupt or withdraw from service, still haven’t found a
replacement.
•  This number peaked in October 2022 at 46,000 companies. Since then, only 10% have found new
power suppliers. The remaining 41,000 now get electricity from EPCOs as “Final power supply

security” customers, which must pay extra charges for the electricity.

•  Complying with METI’s requirements, the EPCOs will accept their former clients as a “standard
customer” starting April 2023.
• TAKEAWAY: Many new power market players have stopped signing new contracts to sell electricity, because
the more they sell the more they sink into the red. Corporate clients who once left EPCOs are having to return,
but are now being asked to pay according to a new price menu. Some corporates can’t afford this, which is

why they are listed as “Final power supply security” customers. So, METI has requested EPCOs to accept their
former corporate clients at a cheaper standard pricing. EPCOs are complying, but limiting the rate at which
they accept the return of their former customers. Due to a sharp hike in fuel costs, EPCOs can't accept all
customers that wish to buy power at the “standard” menu. This is why the number of stranded corporate
clients remains high.



New power market players see retail market volume decline 19.7%
(Denki Shimbun, Mar. 2)
•  According to the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC), the total amount of

electric power sold by EPCOs was 48,639 GWh, while new market players sold 10,681 GWh.
•  The monthly volume sold by EPCOs fell 2.5% YoY; new retail market players saw their volume
decline 19.7%, the second consecutive month of double-digit loss.
•  The market share of new power players for November was 18.0%, down 3.1% YoY.
• TAKEAWAY: The market share held by new retail players is expected to decline further in December 2022 or
January 2023.



Osaka Gas and Leapton Energy agree to buy power from FIP sources

(Company statement, March 1)
•  Osaka Gas agreed with Leapton Energy, which installs solar power plants, for long-term power
supplies from solar power plants that utilize FIP.
•  Osaka Gas will buy 5 MW per year or more — at a fixed price.
•  Osaka Gas targets 5 GW of renewable capacity in Japan and overseas by FY2030.



Hitachi Energy to build HVDC factory in India – fourth production base globally

(Denki Shimbun, March 2)
•  In February, Hitachi Energy will open a plant in Chennai, India to make high voltage direct current
(HVDC) transmission equipment. This is their fourth factory for HVDC t, following a new factory in
Sweden last November.
•  In reaction to the global trend of building large scale offshore wind farms, Hitachi Energy is
receiving orders for HVDC transmission equipment. To date, Hitachi has a total of seven orders
from India.
• TAKEAWAY: Hitachi’s engineering know-how for HVDC equipment mostly depends on ABB’s grid business,

which it fully took over in 2022. The origin of HVDC dates to 1954 when Asea (which represents the “A” of
ABB) built the world's first HVDC transmission system from mainland Sweden to Gotland Island.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
AND FILIPPO PEDRETTI

Japan’s Energy Market in the New World Disorder
The tectonic geopolitical shifts in 2022 brought tremendous changes to global energy
markets. While politics reshaped Japan’s energy sources, import data shows that
Asia’s second-largest economy also charted a pragmatic course, especially in relation
to the purchase of Russian commodities.

The war in Ukraine has led to the creation of two major geopolitical blocs, with each
side grouping consumers into categories of “friendly” and “unfriendly” nations. Japan
stood with its G7 allies, denouncing Russia’s February 2022 incursion into Ukraine, and
took swift action on sanctions.

Altering energy flows in line with political positions, however, has proved challenging,
especially since the ensuing market disarray led to a steep rise in commodity prices.
What’s more, inflation and rate increases in western markets significantly weakened
the yen, restricting Tokyo’s room for maneuver. So, while the import of Russian coal
and crude oil slowed, purchases of its LNG actually climbed.

Early trade data from this year indicates that energy pragmatism and security concerns
remain Japan’s dominant government and corporate policy. Japan NRG analyzed
trade data to see how the new global geopolitical landscape has influenced the
energy sector.

In 2022, the value of Japan’s LNG imports reached ¥8.5 trillion, doubling from ¥4.3
trillion in 2021. That’s despite import volumes declining only slightly to 72 million tons
from 74 million tons a year earlier. With Chinese LNG purchase down significantly,
Japan retained its crown as the world’s largest importer of the fuel.

Russia held on to its place as Japan’s third largest supplier, trailing Australia and
Malaysia. Japan persuaded its G7 partners to exempt gas produced at Russia's
Sakhalin-2 LNG plant from sanctions; the country’s energy security hung in the
balance and any damage could have ripple effects.

Russian LNG sales to Japan increased to 6.9 million tons from 6.6 million tons,
bringing its share of Japan’s total to 9.5%, up from 8.8% a year earlier.

Nearly all of the Russian gas came from the Sakhalin-2 plant where Japanese trading
companies Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co. continue to hold onto their stakes
despite voices of unease both from allies and in Moscow. The reasons for that include
decades of investment in Russian LNG infrastructure development and proximity of
Sakhalin-2 to Japanese ports. In addition, the price for Russian gas averaged ¥98,640/
ton in 2022, below the overall average of ¥117,356/ ton at which Japan imported the
molecules.

Meanwhile, imports from Qatar slumped to 2.9 million tons, from 9 million tons a year
prior, reflecting JERA’s decision not to renew a 5.5 million ton/ year long-term
contract that expired at the end of 2021. Imports from the U.S. decreased to 4.1
million tons, down from 7.1 million tons, mostly due to the lingering effects of the
accident at the Freeport LNG facility in Texas. In late 2021, JERA, the world's biggest
LNG buyer, acquired a 25.7% stake in Freeport.

Australia, the top supplier to Japan, exported 31 million tons of LNG, up from 27
million tons a year ago. Malaysia exported 12 million tons despite a blast at the key
Sabah-Sarawak gas pipeline, which has restricted the nation’s exports since October
2022. Supply from Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Algeria also rose.

In January 2023, Russia accounted for 10% of total imports, behind Australia’s 34%
and Malaysia’s 16%.

Crude oil
The 2022 total value of crude imports was ¥13.3 trillion, nearly double the previous
annual amount of ¥6.9 trillion. By volume, Japan imported a total of 132 billion
kiloliters of crude oil (830.28 billion barrels), up 8.6% from a year earlier.

Ironically, in 2022, Japan shifted back to the Middle East, which accounted for a total
of 94.1% of crude imports; this compares to 68% in 1987 and 92.7% in 2021. This is a
drastic about-face. In the 2010s, Japan specifically increased purchases of Russian
crude to shift away from overt dependence on a historically volatile Middle East
region.

Imports from Saudi Arabia, the biggest supplier, increased by 7.8% year-on-year to 59
billion kiloliters; and the U.A.E., the second biggest seller for Japan, rose 18% to 49
billion kiloliters. Omani crude surged 150% to 1.6 billion kiloliters.

Despite the smaller market share, Russia remains Japan’s second largest crude
supplier outside the Middle East. In 2022, the share of Russian crude oil imports fell to
1.5% of Japan’s total, down from 3.6%, as imports from Sakhalin-1 were suspended.
Those imports hit zero from September to December, but Japan will continue to
receive Sakhalin-2 crude, a byproduct of LNG that’s exempted from U.S.-led
sanctions. Japan has argued that the loss of the crude byproduct would alter the
economics of LNG production.

The U.S. was a big winner as oil sales to Japan jumped more than three-fold to
¥144.9 billion. The U.S. expanded its share to 9.9%, up from 7.2%. The price of
American oil averaged ¥110/ kiloliter, which was above the overall ¥100/ kiloliter
average and the Russian average of ¥91/ kiloliter.

In January 2023, Russia accounted for 1% of Japan’s oil imports. The U.S. had 2%.

Coal
In terms of coal, 2022 was certainly a difficult year for Japan. While volumes were
almost identical to 2021, at 183 million tons, the financial value of imports almost
tripled to ¥7.79 trillion. Of the total, 115 million tons were in thermal coal for power
generation, and 63 million tons were coking coal for steel production.
Last year, PM Kishida vowed to phase out Russian coal imports, without giving a
timeline. Data shows that Japan has halved its dependence on coal from Russia, which
accounted for 10.8% of total imports in 2021 and just 6.3% in 2022. Still, Russia
remained the third-largest coal supplier after Australia and Indonesia. Canada crawled
17


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

up to fourth place, thanks to a doubling of its thermal coal exports. Those three
countries took market share away from Russia.

In terms of value, Russian thermal coal imports increased dramatically, by 76.7% and
unlike LNG or crude oil, the price was not at a heavy discount to global markets,
reflecting the challenge of replacing specific grades of the mineral. Russian imports
averaged ¥42,936/ ton, less than the cost of Australian coal but higher than Canadian
or Indonesian equivalents.

Australia confirmed its position as Japan's largest coal source, accounting for 67% of
total imports. However, Australian thermal coal cost jumped 201.5%, with the
benchmark Newcastle price exceeding a record $400 per ton last year.

Although Australian coal is suitable for Japanese power plants due to its low ash and
sulfur levels, many companies now intend to look for lower grade alternatives in order
to shrink costs. Africa and South America are seen as interesting alternative sources
for the fuel. Such strategic planning is even more necessary as China, a top coal
importer, prepares for an economic recovery. As a result, Australia’s Newcastle
benchmark regressed to just $179.57 per ton at the end of February.

Russian coal imports declined to 3% of Japan’s total in January 2023.


Limits to diversification’s effectiveness
The biggest energy drama of 2022 was likely in the LNG sector, which faced tight
global supplies. With Russian pipeline volumes down significantly, cas-starved E.U.
became the premium global market, bidding up LNG cargo prices to divert supply
from Asia. In addition to this, Japanese buyers had to deal with LNG supply
disruptions in the U.S. and Malaysia, and had walked away from new Qatari contracts.

Ironically, Russian LNG served as Japan’s safety net while supplies from the U.S. and
Malaysia declined. Tokyo’s response was to launch a new national stockpile called the
Strategic Buffer LNG, where importers can keep extra supplies in case of
emergencies.

Japan reduced reliance on Russian crude oil but its decades-long strategy to depend
less on the volatile Middle East fell apart. Ties with Southeast Asian oil producers look
promising but those countries have less room to export because their domestic
energy demand is rising. Japan’s answer to this conundrum was to deepen ties with
Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Oman, signing bilateral agreements on stabilizing fossil
fuel supplies and in return helping them develop ammonia and hydrogen resources.

Last year showed that Japan’s strategy of locking supplies in long-term contracts, and
diversifying supply sources to minimize dependency on high-risk regions is not always
viable. That strategy worked well in a buyers’ market, but in today’s new geopolitical
disorder, it leaves countries scrambling to secure fuel from any possible option.

For now, 2023 has started with a milder tone. Commodity prices have softened and
the yen has strengthened against the dollar. But like the future of the war in Ukraine,
the picture of future energy flows remains blurry. Businesses and governments will
need to create more buffers, more risk-hedging strategies and even more
diversification options to maintain balance.

Notes From Major Energy Summits Last Week:
All Eyes on How to Decarbonize

Several big events took place in Tokyo last week, among them the Asia Zero
Emissions Community (AZEC) Public-Private Investment Forum and the Japan Energy
Summit. While LNG and thermal power featured prominently, almost all discussions
and speeches focused on how to decarbonize energy systems and the great
uncertainty in demand outlook for fossil fuels in the coming decades. How to bridge
traditional and new energy technologies, while maintaining security of supply, remains
a key conundrum. We list some of the big talking points from last week’s events.


AZEC, March 3
The AZEC forum is supported both by the Japanese government (via METI) and big
businesses (via the Keidanren lobby group). It aims to align Japan’s energy transition
strategies with those of other nations in the region, especially those in Southeast Asia.
With Japan already a major investor in energy and electricity facilities in Asia,
achieving regional consensus on policies is good for business. So, while METI hosted
top political leaders from Asia in Tokyo at the AZEC Ministerial Meeting, the Public-
Private Investment Forum gave a chance for politicians to be joined by the chiefs of
Japan’s biggest energy companies.

Attendees at the AZEC forum included the ministers responsible for energy in
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Australia. Business speakers included the presidents of
JERA, JOGMEC, IHI, Sumitomo Corporation, Erex and Shizen Energy, as well as
senior executives from Tokyo Gas, MUFG Bank, Kawasaki Heavy and Mitsubishi
Heavy.

Presentations by Japanese firms especially focused on technological advances and
new projects in carbon capture (including the transportation of CO2 and its recycling),
hydrogen (both from a green and blue perspective), e-methane as a future clean gas
pathway, and energy storage systems. Speakers from MOE and NEDO, among others
were also keen to point out that Japan has put aside significant public funds to
advance these technologies and would look to sponsor projects that introduce them
both at home and abroad.

Japan’s actions to cut emissions abroad (via its companies and technologies), and an
ability to county part of the reduced volumes against its own CO2 reduction targets, is
a big part of the national strategy, according to a presentation from the MOE official.

Finance officials were keen to show the sector was moving forward in forging clean
investment rules that can apply to Asia while respecting the region’s unique position.

One sector that perhaps did not get as much attention, however, was renewable
energy generation. Offshore wind is the main topic at a couple of other industry
gatherings in Tokyo in early March, but it has yet to gain prominence at regional
diplomacy showcases like the AZEC.

Japan Energy Summit, Feb 28-March 2
Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition was originally an event for the natural gas and LNG
industry, but it has evolved in the last two years to include hydrogen, ammonia and
other clean energy technologies. As such, many of the event’s 12 sessions involved
discussions on how to incorporate these fuels into a net-zero world, with over 300
participants also joining in polls during panels to offer their perspectives.

The event featured keynote speeches from the director of the gas and petroleum
division of METI, Soda Takeshi, the Secretary General of the International Energy
Forum, Joseph McMonigle, and the Executive Director of the Hydrogen Council,
Daryl Wilson. Panelists over the three days were senior executives from JERA, Tokyo
Gas, Osaka Gas, JOGMEC, Venture Global LNG, JBIC, Kawasaki Heavy, PetroChina,
Alaska LNG and Bosch Corp.

A brief summary of select sessions:

METI Keynote:
• Japan needs an additional 1,050 GW of renewable energy to achieve carbon
neutrality by 2050, and METI is preparing for both the most optimistic and worst-
case outcome based on IEA scenarios.
• Asian countries still need coal-fired power generation, but METI will support
energy transition initiatives in Asia while promoting economic security.


International Energy Forum (IEF) Keynote:
• Half of the net-zero goals for 2050 can be met with existing technologies. For the
rest, we need to rely on innovative technologies still in the R&D stage or even
earlier.

Gas buyers panel:
• Japan needs to stabilize its gas reserves.
• War in Ukraine sent gas prices to levels that are beyond affordability in Asia,

which is why the industry needs to have better contingency plans and work much
harder on its pricing.

Hydrogen Council Keynote:
• Asia can be a hydrogen trade hub and Japan is one of the leaders in private
sector development of the various steps in the supply chain of the fuel, with state
support.
• Biggest challenge for hydrogen over the next 12-24 months is achieving

international consensus on standardization and certification. The ability to track
CO2 volumes across all steps of the supply chain and prioritize low carbon
numbers over color (for example: green vs blue) is important to create a
transparent global market for hydrogen.

Hydrogen panel:
• Many of Japan’s hydrogen technologies are valid but not yet economical.




20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• Ammonia is currently seen as the most likely way to transport hydrogen and store
it. But, each hydrogen carrier pathway has its merits and will be able to appeal to
its own consumer niche / geography.
• E-methane is gaining in recognition and there are U.S.-Japan projects starting to
emerge in this niche.


Energy trading panel:
• As the price of LNG has been increased drastically, Japan needs measures to
stabilize supply. This can be done through a stronger rollout of renewable energy
or a more active restart of nuclear power plants.
• The market for electricity derivatives is growing rapidly, but is still relatively small.
Futures volume is equal to about 5% of physical volume in Japan. In mature

markets, derivatives volume is several times larger than physical volume.

Tech and infrastructure panel:
• Osaka Gas is focusing on methanation and building out low-cost e-methane
supply chains to bring down the emissions from natural gas.
• Japanese startup Helical Fusion, in association with universities in Tokyo, Nagoya
and Kyoto, aims to establish a working nuclear fusion energy facility in Japan by
2034.
• ABB sees wide scope to cut GHG in the LNG value chain.


International LNG cooperation panel:
• The EU became one of the world’s biggest LNG buyers last year, but it maintains
its course to phase out fossil fuels over the mid-term and focus on renewable
energy and hydrogen. However, in the meantime, Europe will need to engage in
“LNG diplomacy”.
• Europe’s recent investments in LNG receiving infrastructure could be repurposed

for clean fuels or moved for use elsewhere. So, the investment does not
necessarily lock Europe into LNG use for the long term.
• New projects like the Alaska LNG development are already thinking about how
they can be attractive to buyers by adding CCS tech and potential pathways into
ammonia production.
• Africa’s natural gas industry could emerge as a major exporter over coming

decade in addition to U.S. and Middle East supply.

Zero-emissions mobility panel:
• ENEOS operates 47 out of 160 hydrogen refueling stations in Japan, but
struggles to maintain the facilities with only 5-6 customer a day.
• ChemOne produces sustainable aviation fuel from palm oil and used cooking oil.
Japan aims to switch 10% of aviation fuel to SAF by 2030.

Maritime industry panel:
• By 2050, the world needs 110 times more vessels that operate on clean fuels such

as ammonia or methanol.


21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• Companies are still looking at both pipeline and shipping technologies to move
hydrogen.

CCS panel:
• Carbon capture (via CCS, CCUS and DAC) are seen as key to achieving net zero.
This is the essential component of decarbonizing thermal power generation.

• Japan’s CCUS site in Tomakomai is a good example of a project that was well
executed and showed no CO2 leakage. But now Japan must identify more sites
(at home and abroad) in order to move the sector forward. Japan’s new CCS
projects expected to start around 2030.
• Japan expects annual CCS storage needs to be between 120 and 240 million tons
of CO2 by 2050. Transportation tech for the CO2 needs verification.


Carbon trading speeches and panels:
• Former IEA chief Tanaka Nobuo and METI official Nakayama Ryutaro discussed
how Japan could achieve carbon neutrality by developing a domestic market for
carbon.
• METI plans to implement Phase 1 of the Green Transformation over the next two-
three years, which will see the gradual incorporation of carbon pricing in the
broader economy.
• Recent focus on energy security has slowed investment in carbon credits and

offsets, which has delayed work to introduce carbon trading mechanisms in
Japan. But this momentum will pick up and, more importantly, it needs
international cooperation to make sure carbon credit systems are inter-connected
or that they share common standards and rules.

Energy policy panel:
• METI said it’s planning to upgrade Japan’s power grid to allow an 8-fold growth
in renewable energy over time.

• At the same time, officials believe Japan must develop next-generation nuclear
reactors to maintain energy security.
• Japan should learn from the U.S.’s IRA and EU’s Green Deal subsidy programs
and work out its own plans. Equally, the government needs to motivate the
population to change behavior in order to accelerate the move to carbon
neutrality in Japan.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Canada/ LNG
Pipeline operator Enbridge will invest C$3.3 billion in natural gas and liquids
infrastructure and in renewable power. The company will also buy a gas storage
facility on the Gulf of Mexico to strengthen its LNG export business.

Carbon emissions
Global CO2 emissions from energy hit a record high last year, but increased slower
than expected thanks to growth in renewable energy. The record 36.8 billion tons of
CO2 emissions in 2022 was a rise of just under 1%, the IEA said. In 2021, that rise was
6%.

Energy Transition
In 2021, financing for energy totalled $1.9 trillion, $1 trillion of which went to fossil
fuels and the rest to low-carbon energy projects. To reach energy transition goals for
2030, the world needs to invest $4 in renewable energy for every $1 invested in fossil
fuels.

Europe/ Energy crisis
European countries' bill to shield households and companies from soaring energy
costs has climbed to nearly €800 billion, reported the Brussels-based think tank,
Bruegel. Germany led the continent, spending about €280 billion.

India/ Solar power
Solar module makers, including Reliance Industries and Tata Power, are among
bidders for $2.4 billion in incentives to expand domestic manufacturing and curb
imports from China. The government’s goal is to boost the country’s module-making
capacity to 90 GW.

Malaysia/ Renewable energy
Gentari, the clean energy arm of state oil firm Petronas, sees India and Australia as key
markets for growth. In June, Petronas launched Gentari with the goal to build 40 GW
in renewable energy capacity and produce up to 1.2 million tons of hydrogen annually
by 2030.

Mozambique/ LNG
In July, Italy’s Saipem will restart its LNG project for TotalEnergies. Frozen in 2021 due
to security issues, the project will be the first onshore LNG plant in Mozambique. The
Saipem contract is €3.5 billion.

Solar power
By 2027 solar PV power will have the largest share of capacity of any generation
source, according to the IEA. A decade ago, solar power had less than 1% of global
energy capacity, the smallest share of any power source at that time.

Spain/ Offshore wind power
The government approved its first areas for wind farms on 5,000 km2 of maritime area
that’s divided into 19 sectors. Spain has one of the largest expanses of sea in the EU.

UK/ Nuclear power
EDF's new nuclear plant is likely to cost 30% more than its last budget estimate as
inflation propels the price tag to almost £33 billion. The Hinkley Point C is Britain's
first new nuclear plant in two decades. EDF is building the plant with China's CGN,
which has a 33.5% stake.

UK/ North Sea energy
The windfall tax led to more than 90% of North Sea oil and gas producers cutting
spending, with the policy “undermining” the country’s energy security, say critics.
Meanwhile, the North Sea has potential for as much as £220 billion to be spent on oil
and gas, offshore wind, CCS and hydrogen projects by 2030, said the head of the
North Sea Transition Authority.
