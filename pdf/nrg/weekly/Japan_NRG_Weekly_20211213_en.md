Japan’s 2020 carbon emissions down to lowest since 1990

(Japan NRG, Dec. 10)
•  Japan released 1.15 billion tons of carbon in fiscal 2020 ending in March 2021, down 5.1% from
the previous term; the lowest since records were taken in 1990.
•  In 2020 emissions dropped 18.4% from 2013 levels; down 16.8% from 2005.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s fiscal 2030 emissions reduction pledge is based on fiscal 2013 as its
benchmark. That year Japan had no nuclear power plants operating and usage of fossil fuels was at
elevated levels.





































Thermal power plants claim 10 million tons of CO2 were cut due to upgrades

(Japan NRG, Dec. 6)

•  A power plant operators association said its members cut over 10 million tons of CO2 in fiscal 2020
thanks to upgrades at members’ thermal power stations.
•  The Council of Electric Utilities for Low Carbon Society (ELCS), which is comprised of 65 power
operators that account for about 75% of power generated in Japan, said that in April 2020 to
March 2021 its members released 328 million tons of carbon, a decrease of 17 million tons.

•  Of the cuts, 10.6 million tons were thanks to the launch of a high-performance thermal power plant
and to improving heat efficiency at two other plants.
•  An ELCS official also told a METI sub-panel that early restarts of nuclear power plants are vital to
achieve greater emission cuts in Japan.

•  CONTEXT: In 2021, in April and in November, two IGCC plants were brought on-stream in

Fukushima. Launch of an integrated coal gasification fuel cycle (IGFC) plant is planned for 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: According to the International Energy Agency, no matter how advanced the technology, a coal
power plant without CCS or the means to mitigate emissions should be phased out. For the moment, Japan is
not entirely following that principle.

• METI said previously that a 1 GW IGCC, or an A-USC coal plant at a 70% run rate, emits 4.4 million tons of
CO2/ year, compared to over 5 million tons for older coal-fired technology. An IGFC plant is expected to emit
3.6 million tons under the same conditions.




METI panel for designing carbon exchange kicks off
(Japan NRG, Dec. 8)
•  The nine-member carbon credit framework panel that will design Japan’s carbon exchange, set to
launch in 2022, held its inaugural meeting.
•  The panel will hold interviews with trading houses, energy companies, financial institutions and
exchanges, and it will issue a report to be made public in spring 2022.

•  Panel chairman, Professor Arimura Toshi of Waseda University, warned that price discovery on the
exchange will be slow as Japanese companies aren’t under any obligation to cap and trade
emissions. Japan also needs to open its programs globally to stay relevant. Points raised by other
panel members included:
o  The exchange mechanism will likely incentivize suppliers but less so consumers; will
buyers reach out for just any offset credits?
o  Each credit type has its own market; there is stronger interest in credits from projects that

absorb carbon rather than from those that claim to reduce it;

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Is market-driven “carbon neutrality” compatible with the IPCC definition? The term
“carbon neutrality” should not be used for carbon trading;
o  The exchange should have options to hold auctions in the absence of price signals in
lackluster trading;
o  Clarity is lacking on what exactly are voluntary credits, absorption/reduction of carbon,

and the links between corporate reduction efforts and nationally determined
contributions (NDC);
o  Japan’s voluntary credits are negligible internationally and need to develop.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s powerful business lobby, Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), opposes a
hike in the greenhouse warming tax and placing caps on emissions, claiming this potentially deters
competitiveness. The Kishida government has so far closely followed the voice of big business.

PM confirms 46% GHG target for 2030; net-zero by 2050

(Sekiyu Tsushin, Dec. 8)
•  As the Diet convened on Dec. 6, Prime Minister Kishida reiterated his commitment to reduce GHG
emissions 46% by 2030, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and deregulate to boost investment in
renewables.
•  The PM cited plans to electrify infrastructure, upgrade the grid, install more battery storage, and
convert thermal plants to run on ammonia or hydrogen.
•  The government plans to turn climate action into a growth industry.

Japan, China and S. Korea Environment Ministers agree on eight climate action initiatives
(Japan NRG, Dec. 7)
•  The environmental ministers of Japan, China and South Korea agreed on eight climate action
programs at the Triparty Environment Ministers Meeting (TEMM) on Dec. 7. The initiatives include

stronger monitoring of acid rain and other air pollution, carbon neutrality policy, green economy
development, promotion of zero-waste cities, sharing bio diversity best practices, and more.
•  The ministers also shared plans to end state funding of coal plants overseas.
•  In April, South Korea said it will end state financing of overseas coal plants, followed by Japan in
June, and China in September. Domestic phase-out plans were not discussed.
•  The ministers will meet online again on Dec. 17 for the “trilateral business round table”, although

businesses are not invited.
•  Domestic coal power phase out plans of the three countries:

Installed capacity Phase out plans

Japan      48 GW        To cut coal power share to 26% by 2030 (6th Basic Energy Plan)
South Korea 36 GW       To close all plants whose 30-year life cycle expires by 2034 (9th Basic Energy Plan)

METI committee proposes to exclude geothermal plants under 1 MW from FIP scheme

(Japan NRG, Dec. 8)
•  The Power Tariff Committee under METI proposes to exclude geothermal plants under 1 MW from
the 2024 Feed-in-Premium scheme due to high costs; 90% of existing plants have capacity of less
than 1 MW.
•  Plants over 1 MW are 60% more cost efficient than the smaller ones.

•  CONTEXT: Japan’s current geothermal capacity is 0.6 GW. The 2030 goal is to expand it to 0.7-1
GW, generating 3.4 TWh. The 2021 Feed-in-Tariff geothermal rates are ¥26-40/ kWh. In
comparison, power rates in the U.S., which has six times more capacity, are about ¥8/ kWh.
• TAKEAWAY: While the Tariff Committee’s proposal would exclude small 10 kW plants at hot spring resort

hotels, geothermal heat used for home air conditioning is supported under the zero-emission home (ZEH)
program. Experts have urged expanding the use of geothermal resources beyond power generation.

Japan-Sweden venture takes delivery of world’s first LNG+battery fueled vessel
(Kankyo Business, Dec. 6)
•  United European Car Carriers (UECC), a joint venture between Nippon Yusen (NYK Line) and
Swedish shipbuilder Wallenius Lines, said it has taken delivery of the world's first hybrid car carrier

that combines LNG fuel and batteries.
•  The vessel, named AUTO ADVANCE (gross tonnage 35,667 tons), is the first in a series of three
ordered by UECC from China's Jiangnan Shipbuilding. It is also the world's first LNG-fueled car
carrier to adopt a battery hybrid system to further improve fuel efficiency. The vessel will be used
in Europe.
•  According to NYK, the conversion to LNG fuel and the installation of a battery hybrid system are

expected to reduce Sox emissions by about 90%, NOx emissions by about 85%, and CO2
emissions by about 25% compared to conventional heavy oil-fired vessels.



Underground hydrogen storage solves energy challenges
(Nikkei X-Tech, Dec. 7)
•  In partnership with U.S.-based Magnum Development, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is working on a

project to store 150 GW hours’ worth of energy in the form of hydrogen gas in an underground
cavern carved into salt.
•  The site is in the State of Utah and will begin operations in 2025.
•  Compressed hydrogen will be stored at depths of more than 1,000 meters.
•  This approach offers low-cost, long-term storage in an environment that is less prone to leaking
than tanks on the surface.
•  The hydrogen will be pressurized to between 10 and 30 mega-pascals to prevent the cavern walls

from caving in.



Nippon Paper invents wood-based battery
(Nikkei, Dec. 6)
•  Nippon Paper successfully used a wood-based battery to power a light bulb.

Japanese consortium starts Vehicle-to-Home charging experiment

(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 7)
•  Kansai Electric, Idemitsu Kosan, and Sumitomo Electric Industries announced the start of a V2H
(Vehicle-to-Home) recharging and discharging experiment.
•  The three companies have conducted experiments to stabilize the power grid and create benefits
for users by recharging vehicles during times when electricity demand and unit prices are low.
•  In light of the tight supply and demand of electricity last winter, the companies plan to control

remotely the discharging of electricity during periods of high demand and high unit prices.
•  The aim is to use this system as a VPP (Virtual Power Plant) resource for electric vehicles (EVs) in
general households, with no loss of usability.




One-Dot News:
•  Shipping firm Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha signed a marine biofuel supply contract with BP after
conducting a test voyage using marine biofuel. The shipper’s car carrier sailed on marine biofuel

METI calls on utilities to limit thermal output
(Nikkei, Dec. 7)
•  METI is beefing up rules that require operators of gas and coal-fired plants to limit output at times
of high output from renewable facilities.
•  This will stop renewably-generated energy from being wasted.
•  Previously, operators of thermal plants could be ordered to limit output to 50% of capacity. Under

the new rules, METI could instruct generators to limit output to 30%, or even 20%, of capacity.
•  This is part of efforts to turn renewables into a main source of electricity.
•  Based on METI statistics, limiting output from some major thermal plants to 20% of capacity will
free up around 1.5 GW of transmission capacity.
• TAKEAWAY: The idea that major power utilities should be ordered to stop prioritizing their big thermal and
nuclear power plants for grid access and curtailing energy from the smaller renewables developers was
promoted much earlier this year under then Prime Minister Suga. This order seems to be a continuation of the

same policy and therefore should not come as a major surprise. However, at a glance, it looks like a loss for the
big power utilities, the EPCos, which sought to show that the overall cost of electricity and the system’s
stability would be undermined if their large power facilities were forced to curtail at the expense of renewables
capacity.

• It’s interesting to note that this change comes after some large domestic non-electricity companies entered
the industry over the last six to 10 months. This will be a corporate strategy story as well as a technical grid
story worth monitoring over the next few years.



JERA shuts down 2.4 GW of aging thermal power capacity
(Nikkei, Dec. 7)
•  JERA decommissioned Units 1 through 4 (capacity 2.4 GW) at its Anegasaki plant.
•  The LNG-fired plant is in Chiba and generated electricity for over 40 years.
•  Units 5 and 6 haven’t been decommissioned, but neither is operational. JERA will restart Unit 5 in

January to avert winter power shortages.
•  In 2023, JERA will modernize the site with state-of-the-art equipment.




Itochu plans to build 5,000 mini solar plants nationwide by 2025
(Asia Nikkei, Dec. 10)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Itochu Corp. plans to build 5,000 small solar power plants across Japan by 2025 and market the
electricity to companies seeking green power options. The total capacity may be around 500 MW.
•  In November, Itochu invested in Clean Energy Connect, a solar power developer in Japan. The
companies plan to acquire idle land across the country for the mini solar farms. The electricity
generated will be bundled and supplied to companies on 20-year contracts known as power

purchase agreements (PPA).
•  The electricity will cost similar to the current level of the feed-in tariff.
•  This project could make Itochu one of the biggest retailers of electricity from renewable sources in
Japan. Currently, there is a shortage of electricity from renewable sources as companies seek to
lower their CO2 footprint.
•  CONTEXT: The pace of introduction of new renewables capacity in Japan has slowed as the tariffs

that guarantee developers a certain fee for the power have dropped over the years.




Solar generators hit by price increases, delays
(Mega Solar Business, Dec. 9)
•  Two thirds of solar operators surveyed by the Japan PV Planner Association said they’re paying at
least 15% more for solar panels than last year.

•  The higher prices impacted utilization of the FIT plan, with some saying they had filed fewer FIT
applications.
•  46% of respondents said they waited less than one month for solar panel deliveries; 35% waited
over three months for deliveries, while 28% said their suppliers would not even commit to a
delivery date.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

NRA chairman warns Spring 2023 treated water release deadline under pressure
(Asahi Shimbun, Dec. 9)
o  Chairman of the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), said that if TEPCO does not submit

plans for new facilities to be built for the release of treated Fukushima water before the
end of this year, it will be difficult to start releasing the water in spring of 2023.
o  CONTEXT: TEPCO’s water release plans are being delayed by the preparatory work
around the construction of an undersea tunnel to allow for the water discharge to take
place one kilometer offshore.




Will LNG shortage mean higher gas/power bills?
(Motohashi Keiichi, Energy Shift, Dec 8)
•  Most of Japan’s LNG is purchased on long-term contracts, so utilities are less vulnerable to
volatility in LNG spot markets in Asia and Europe.
•  However, strong demand in China and India means that the global LNG supply is likely to remain
tight until 2030.
•  These factors, combined with the phasing out of coal-fired power stations, mean that Japanese

power and gas bills are unlikely to fall. Consumers can expect gas and power tariffs to remain high.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE


A Review of the Net-Zero Strategies of Japanese Trading Houses

A good bellwether for industrial Japan is the nation’s trading houses. These ultimate
conglomerates span hundreds of industries, products and geographies, and they carry
a historic mission to secure Japan’s raw materials and sources of energy.

With that in mind, the actions and words of Japan’s top seven trading houses over the
last six months are highly indicative of the country’s overall net-zero strategy. All seven
quickly unveiled net-zero targets for 2050 and signaled plans to stop new investments
in coal.

Several, including Mitsubishi Corp. and Toyota Tsusho, unveiled trillion-yen spending
plans on decarbonization, and most added carbon capture and storage (CCS) and
ammonia/hydrogen supply chain building to their to-do list.

This push into clean energy, however, won’t come at the expense of all fossil fuel
investments. While new coal fields and power plants are off the menu, interest in new
gas (and LNG) projects remains healthy, with the caveat that CCS solutions should be
an option. Oil divestments are “replaced” with other oil assets that offer lower carbon
intensity or better economics.

The strategies of the seven majors are not in sync in all fields. For example, in EVs and
batteries the approaches are diverse.

Getting ahead of the trend has kept Japan’s trading houses in business for centuries.
Their latest actions indicate that while new energy systems are being assembled and
scaled up, existing hydrocarbon infrastructure (in some form) will retain a significant
role for several more decades.


History’s big wins
No investor wins big every time and the trading houses have had big misses too, but
the group known as sogo shosha in Japanese have notched up several famous hits.
For example, the trading houses invested heavily in Australian coal in the 1970s,
securing fuel not only for Japan but for China’s economic surge that started the
1990s.

The group also moved into power and water utilities, a more conservative investment,
a decade before the last commodity rally wound down.

Once the Japanese government pledged to decarbonize in late 2020, the traders
moved quickly to make net-zero commitments for 2050. Mitsubishi Corp. said it would
allocate ¥2 trillion to decarbonization over this decade, and Toyota Tsusho set its
budget for the same at ¥1.6 trillion.

In reality, the seven largest trading houses – Mitsubishi, Marubeni, Mitsui, Sumitomo,
Toyota Tsusho, Itochu, and Sojitz – made inroads into clean energy years ago with

investments in solar, wind, biomass, storage, AI-driven electricity system management
and other technologies.

Despite that, the traders never abandoned their fossil fuel assets and it looks like they
are also cautious about letting them go now.

Coal does not phase out easily
In the past six months, the seven largest trading houses said they will not be acquiring
new thermal coal assets or investing in new coal-fired power plants. The timeline to
phase out their existing assets in the field, however, has been set over the next one to
two decades.

Itochu is likely to achieve the first complete withdrawal from coal-fired power
generation, as it has interests in only one Indonesian plant that is currently on sale.
Mitsui aims to divest from its coal power projects by 2030, while Marubeni and
Sumitomo plan to do so in 2040-2050. Mitsubishi and Marubeni do not own any
stakes in thermal coal mines. Itochu seeks to sell its mining projects by March 2024,
and Sojitz and Sumitomo by 2030.

Divesting coal assets does not entirely mean the end of the coal business. Among the
trading houses, only Sumitomo said it won’t enter into any contracts to construct coal
power plants. It is not clear if the others are retaining the options to engage with
construction, consulting and other contract work with coal plants.

The companies will continue to trade coal. So long as Japan continues to run coal-
fired power plants, they will have a role in the coal value chain as typically Japanese
power plant operators do not directly import coal to avert risks.

Japanese steelmakers are developing hydrogen steel that does not require coking
coal. Nippon Steel has claimed the technology will make the company carbon neutral

such “revolutionary technologies”.

Only Sojitz has clearly committed to exit from coking coal mines by 2050. Meanwhile,
Mitsui clearly said it won’t move away from coking coal supply chains because it’s not
seeing any decrease in demand. While western countries increase usage of steel scrap
that won’t require coking coal, demand will increase in Southeast Asia and India,
Mitsui says, justifying its position.

In other fossil fuels, Sojitz plans to sell all oil assets by 2030. Other trading houses plan
to rebalance oil and gas asset portfolios to improve their competitiveness. Mitsui,
Mitsubishi, and Itochu said they will seek new LNG projects with low environmental
impact as they have the mission to secure Japan’s energy supplies.

Renewable expansion plans
Mitsubishi   To double renewable capacity to 660 MW in 2030
Marubeni     To raise share of renewable power generation to 20% from 15% by 2023

Mitsui       To raise share of renewable power generation to 30% from 14% by 2030
Sumitomo     To raise share of renewable power generation to 30% from 20% by 2030

Itochu       To raise share of renewable power generation to 20% from 14.5% by 2030
Toyota Tsusho To expand global renewable capacity to 4.9 GW by March 2024 from 3.4 GW
Sojitz       Renewable accounts for 30% of power in 2020



Net-zero growth pipelines
The trading houses plan to increase activity in renewables, CCUS, ammonia,
hydrogen, and zero emission vehicles.

In CCUS, Mitsui has invested in Storegga Geotechnologies in the UK and Fairway
Methanol in the U.S. Mitsubishi signed a strategic partnership with Swiss-based South
Pole and Denbury in the U.S. Marubeni acquired a stake in the UK’s Carbon Clean
Solutions.

Itochu and Toyota Tsusho, rather than acquiring companies, are partnering with them.
Since 2010, Sojitz has been running a CCS project with Canada’s Saskatchewan Power
Corporation. The companies are also involved in ammonia and hydrogen research
projects and supply chain construction frameworks.

The trading houses hold a common vision that zero-emission cars will drive up
demand for battery metals, copper and aluminum. However, they have varied
approaches.

Toyota Tsusho is building an integrated battery supply chain that comprises raw
materials and battery parts, battery manufacturing, battery-based infrastructures such
as charging stations, and recycling of spent batteries and auto parts.

Mitsubishi focuses on upstream copper, aluminum and battery metal investments. It
runs copper and aluminum smelting operations globally, and upstream copper
concentrate and bauxite resources will raise efficiency of their value chains.

Itochu has limited exposure to nonferrous metal production and has been more
downstream focused. It started to run a pilot battery recycling plant that recovers
nickel, cobalt and lithium from spent batteries and plans to commercialize it.
Sumitomo, Mitsui and Marubeni eye both upstream and recycling investments.


Keeping options open
Judging by the strategies of the trading houses, the net-zero trend still contains plenty
of risks. One is that every company trying to decarbonize simultaneously will lead to
price inflation for clean energy assets. Another is that the buy-in from local
communities can be as tricky for renewable energy developments as for those in fossil
fuels.

Also, an expert with the MoE notes that the government is fielding multiple
complaints from firms that feel unable to proceed with renewable energy projects due
to opposition from local communities.

A further risk is that the clean tech of today will be challenged or significantly
improved upon by R&D in the future.

For business conglomerates that have survived in one form or another since the 16th
century, their approach to energy transition could be summarized as “trust but verify”.
And that means maintaining a broad portfolio that can be regularly adjusted and
modernized.

The Complex Business of

Japan’s Municipality-Owned Power Retailers
Once Japan’s power market fully opened up in 2016, private companies and investors
were not the only ones to rush in. A growing trend has emerged of municipalities
setting up their own, local electricity retail firms to supply power to government
buildings, and in some cases, the broader community.

This trend has accelerated in the past two years, and there were 40 municipally-owned
power retailers at the end of FY2020. By May 2021, that number was 75, and it might
exceed 100 if all the municipalities that answered a 2018 survey from Hitotsubashi
University and Asahi Shimbun follow through.

In theory, this gives local governments greater control of their electricity supply and
helps to promote further decarbonization. Japan’s central government has strongly
supported this trend, with METI, MoE and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries (MAFF) among the cheerleaders.

The results so far, however, raise questions. Lacking size and the necessary talent to
operate such businesses, some of the municipally-owned power companies have run
into trouble.


The goal
For municipalities, these ventures have multiple purposes. The first is to help in
decarbonization. Encouraged by METI, the municipalities want to promote the local
consumption of power generated at local plants.

This is intended to increase the consumption of CO2-free energy, while reducing
pressure on the transmission and distribution network since the electricity stays in the
same branch of the grid. The idea also syncs with METI’s broader goal of promoting
the development of micro-grids that best suit local power needs.

As of September 2021, 464 municipalities accounting for 112 million residents have
pledged to reach net-zero CO2 emission by 2050. A recent survey of municipality-
owned retailers showed that 85% launched operations in order to help tackle global
warming.

The second major goal is local economic revitalization. By developing and running
these businesses, municipalities expect to boost local employment, develop local
industries, and lower power costs of public facilities. For example, Himi City in the
Hokuriku area partners with local solar PV installers for rooftop installation work. It also
focuses on signing PPAs with local energy producers.

Hamamatsu City local power producer and supplier, Hamamatsu Shin Denryoku, was
established to increase the self-sufficiency rate of power consumption and revitalize
the local economy. It procures power mainly from local PV and biomass (waste) plants

and covers 80% of its demand with local production. It supplies power to public
facilities, private companies, households, and all public elementary and junior high
schools. The city also offers subsidies for solar power generation and home EV
chargers.

The third goal is to finance social programs for residents. The retailer can also offer
special prices for some residents. Himi City offers reduced prices for senior citizens
and families with children. Shonan Power in Odawara uses profits to support a soccer
team, art programs, environmental improvement, businesses, and etc

The concept of grid resilience in case of natural disaster was also mentioned by 57%
of respondents. Chiba Mutsuzawa Energy is one example of this. Following a major
typhoon in September 2019 that left most of the local area in the dark, the firm kept
powering some of its public facilities and welcomed residents for shelter.


Structure and Business strategy
A 2020 survey showed that local government investment in these businesses is on
average 54% of the total capital. Local energy companies, financial companies, and
other partners account for 17%, and non-local companies 29%.

The municipalities usually partner with energy companies that can either help with the
procurement of local renewable power or have the operational know-how. For
example, Himi City partnered with Hokuriku Electric; and Karatsu City in Kyushu
partnered with a local gas company and with Shizen Energy Group.

Some major regional utilities are worried that this could lead to lower revenue.
Hokuriku Electric and Shikoku Electric, for example, are exploring partnerships with
municipalities to maintain some involvement with clients and offer new services.

Municipalities usually lack the know-how to run retail operations and most of these
companies outsource some functions. Local energy procurement from renewable and
FIT assets is only 36% on average. Most procure the rest of their power from a third
party, usually the same company that provides the balancing operations.

For example, Shin Denryoku Oita signed a PPA with five PV plants in Oita and two in
Kumamoto to secure 11 MW of capacity, 30% of their total power procurement. Of
the remaining power, 30% comes from the JEPX spot market and 40% comes from
major regional utilities.

Surveys show that the next step is to supply power to local companies and residents,
and in rare cases to go beyond the municipality itself. Osumi Peninsula’s Smart Energy
was funded by Kimotsuki Town in Kagoshima Prefecture, and it seeks to introduce the
“Stadt Werke” system, in which a public company runs public facilities and
transportation in the area.

Kimotsuki Town’s population is only 15,000, and it invited four cities and five towns to
join the project. The profits will introduce small generators at schools, rent electric
bikes to tourists, and set up charging bases for cyclists.

Government Support
METI, MOE and MAFF all offer subsidies for the development of municipality-owned
power retailers. METI’s subsidies total ¥3.47 billion, and go towards supporting the
creation of micro-grids for up to two-thirds of the total cost. This funding applies only
to public-private partnerships.

MOE focuses on regional decarbonization, subsidizing businesses in which local
government is involved or which are funded by citizens and that promote
decarbonization. The yearly budget is ¥100 million; since 2018, 16 companies have
received this subsidy.

MAFF fosters sustainable systems and the revitalization of agricultural, fishery, and
mountain areas by introducing renewable power. It helps with consulting and business
matching between renewable power generators, retailers, and consumers in
agricultural, fishery, and mountain areas.


Hurdles Faced by Municipalities
While the concept grows more popular, many municipalities lack the resources or
know-how. The small scale of the business, supplying power only to public facilities,
and a poor understanding of the business, can quickly lead these retailers into the
red.

Risk management is another issue - some retailers were hit hard during last winter’s
JEPX spot price spike crisis. Also, some residents of Ikoma City requested the city to
be audited as the power procured through Ikoma Civic Power turned out to be more
expensive than under previous contracts. Their request was declined.

Miyama Smart Energy in Fukuoka Prefecture expanded its business rapidly and started
selling power nationwide. However, it was badly hit by last winter’s crisis and posted
heavy losses. This was on top of previously reported governance problems.

In Nobeoka City, Miyazaki Prefecture has been talking of establishing a retail company
continues for three years. Some local councilors and businesses oppose the idea,
fearing it will be unprofitable.

Despite support from the government, it is often unclear who benefits from the
creation of these companies. The impact on the development of micro-grids and the
increase in local consumption of locally-produced power is not yet well demonstrated.

The next big test for the municipal-owned firms may come this winter. While their
mission is well received and for the most part supported, these new power retailers
will need to survive the upcoming winter peak in order to be called a success.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Offshore wind power
Alinta Energy, the Hong Kong-owned electricity generating and gas retailer, plans a
$4 billion, 1 GW wind farm off the coast of Victoria province to help power the
Portland aluminium smelter. It would be one of Australia’s first smelters powered
100% by renewables.

China/ Renewable energy
China began the second development round of its 100 GW desert renewable energy
project. Proposals are now accepted by the National Energy Administration; each
project must have at least 1 GW capacity, with construction starting in 2022 and
completed by 2023. The first desert projects were launched in October.

Denmark/ Offshore wind power
Germany's RWE beat out Denmark's Orsted, the world's biggest offshore wind
developer, to build a $2.4 billion, 1 GW wind farm. Dubbed “Thor”, it will be the
world's first offshore wind farm built with payments to the state. Once operational,
possibly in 2026, RWE will pay the Danish state until it reaches a cap of 2.8 billion
Danish crowns ($426 million).

Fossil fuels/ investments
Saudi Aramco’s CEO, Amin Nasser, called for more investment in fossil fuels.
Speaking at the World Petroleum Congress in Texas, Nasser said the transition to
clean fuels was “deeply flawed” and there’s a possibility of “energy insecurity,
rampant inflation and social unrest as prices become intolerably high.”

Hong Kong/ Fossil fuel divestment
Insurance giant AIA Group, which manages a portfolio of $286 billion, sold off $10
billion in coal-related investments, ending its exposure to that industry. AIA joins
many other insurers seeking to decarbonize portfolios. In summer, 15 major insurers
pledged to bring their portfolios to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Indonesia/ Oil and gas
ConocoPhillips will sell its assets in Indonesia for $1.36 billion to local energy
company, Medco Energi Internasional. The asset in question is a 54% stake in
Indonesia Corridor Block Production consisting of two oil fields and seven gas fields,
and a 35% share in the Transasia Pipeline Co.

Saudi Arabia/ Natural gas
A group led by BlackRock will invest $15 billion to buy a 49% stake in a new company
that has 20-year leasing rights to pipelines that carry Saudi Aramco’s gas across the
country. BlackRock and partners outbid EIG, Italian infrastructure firm Snam, and
China’s state-backed Silk Road Fund Co.

Saudi Arabia/ Renewable energy
The Energy Ministry plans to build 10 GW in renewable energy capacity in the next
four years. The Ministry also said the kingdom’s current renewable capacity is about
900 MW, accounting for only 1% of the country’s total power.

Solar power/ China/ U.S.
The U.S. and China will account for 57% of new solar capacity by 2030, adding 151
GW and 437 GW, respectively, according to a report by Fitch Solutions. The U.S. will
remain the second largest solar market behind China, with solar’s share of its power
mix increasing from the current 3.3% to 9% by 2030.

Switzerland/ Commodities trading
Trafigura posted record profits of $3.1 billion, double the previous period, (in the year
to September). Revenue rose 57% to $231 billion on higher commodity prices and
increased trading volumes. The company traded a daily average of 7 million barrels of
oil and petroleum products, up 25%, YoY.

U.S./ Oil and net-zero
Exxon Mobil aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions in the Permian basin by 2030.
The new target is part of the company’s effort to reduce upstream GHG emissions
40% by 2030, compared to 2016 levels. Exxon also plans to eliminate routine flaring
at its Permian basin operations by the end of 2022.

U.S./ LNG
Following high global natural gas demand, deliveries to LNG export terminals surged
to record levels at the end of November, topping 12 Bcf/d. In related news,
construction of the Jordan Cove LNG terminal in Oregon is officially terminated. For
years, the project had stalled due to regulatory and commercial problems.
