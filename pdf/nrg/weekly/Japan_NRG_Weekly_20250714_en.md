NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


FSA to postpone mandatory sustainability disclosures for small companies

(Nikkei, July 7)
•  The Financial Services Agency (FSA) will postpone mandatory sustainability disclosure requirement
for Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime-listed companies with a market capitalization below ¥500 billion. A
final decision on whether to mandate disclosure for these companies will come within a few years.
•  The plan was to ask all Prime-listed firms to disclose sustainability data by FY2030. Now, the
obligation will come in phases. Companies with market caps over ¥3 trillion must start in FY2026.
Those between ¥1 trillion and ¥3 trillion in FY2027. And those between ¥500 billion and ¥1 trillion
could need to start from FY2028, though that timeline may now change.
•  The FSA noted that about 45% of firms in the ¥500 billion–¥1 trillion range have foreign ownership
above 30%. This is in contrast to less than 30% in the ¥300–500 billion range. Foreign investors
tend to demand sustainability data.
•  CONTEXT: Sustainability disclosure is corporate information about environmental, social, human
rights, and governance practices. While companies have included some of this in their securities reports,
there were no clear standards until now. Starting FY2027, companies will need to disclose more detailed
data. They include Scope 3 GHG emissions and climate-related risk strategies. This will be on the basis
of new guidelines set by the Sustainability Standards Board of Japan (SSBJ).



MOL and Kinetics ink MoU for world’s first floating data center platform
(Company statement, July 7)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), signed a MoU with Kinetics, a clean energy and infrastructure initiative
by Karpowership, to develop the world’s first integrated floating data center platform.
•  The project will involve retrofitting used vessels into mobile data centers that will receive power
from Karpowership’s LNG-fueled ships. It’s also possible to integrate onshore grids, solar farms, or
offshore wind depending on location.
•  The first floating data center will launch in 2027, with a capacity of 20 to 73 MW. It will connect to
land-based internet exchanges and submarine cables.
•  The vessel for the data center will weigh 9,731 tons, with a length of 120 meters.
• TAKEAWAY: The offshore model offers several advantages – independent of local electricity supplies; and avoids
the need for expensive and limited land acquisition in metropolitan areas. Also, while a typical land-based data
center may take four years to build, the conversion of a used vessel takes about one year. And the floating
platform allows for mobility. And yet, while this offers respite for a while, it’s not clear how much scale such

offshore centers can offer in the longer-term.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
J-Power and Hitachi sign MoU for renewable-powered data centers
(Company statement, July 7)
o  J-Power and Hitachi inked an MoU to develop a renewable energy-powered AI data center.
o  The move is part of collaborations under the “watt-bitt” model for renewables to power the
increasing high-energy needs of data centers and grow domestic cloud supplying industries.

NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


ANRE proposes mandating electricity retailers to secure supply

(Government statement, July 4)
•  ANRE proposed mandating electricity retailers to secure a certain amount of supply to support
smooth mid- to long-term trading.
•  Under the current Electricity Business Act, retailers are obligated to secure sufficient power supply
capacity. The new system requires retailers to secure 50% of expected demand (kWh) three years
before the actual supply year, and 70% one year prior.
•  To encourage compliance, the system will be reviewed with a focus on clarifying that a violation of
this requirement could be grounds for revoking a retailer’s registration.
•  CONTEXT: Currently, the JEPX operates a baseload market and a forward market – the markets that
allow for mid- to long-term power procurement. But, there are issues with this setup, such as a lack of
options to secure supply capacity in the shorter term.
• TAKEAWAY: Requiring retailers to secure both capacity-based supply (kW) and energy-based supply (kWh) in
an integrated manner should improve the predictability of electricity sales volumes for generators, and help
foster a favorable environment for long-term fuel procurement contracts and encouraging investment in power
sources. However, some retailers will see the new structure as locking them into a system that favors the bigger
power producers as well as retailers with captive generating capacity. The energy agency will need to be wary of
balancing its desire to support stable power supply with the need to allow market signals to play their role in a
liberalized sector.



TOCOM  power futures trading surges on geopolitical risks

(Exchange data, July 8)
•  Electricity futures trading on the TOCOM surged in June, with traded volume jumping 4.3-fold from
May to 766 GWh.
•  Middle East tensions likely spurred trading, with large volumes (705 contracts totaling 618 GWh)
executed for FY2026 delivery, mostly on June 19 and 20.
•  Open interest (positions not offset by opposing trades) hit a record high of 1.5 TWh at month-end,
up 79.2% from May.
•  Prices rose significantly due to tight summer supply and increased demand; notably, Western-area
baseload futures for July increased by ¥1.58/ kWh.



Electricity intraday market sees trading drop despite rising demand
(Denki Shimbun, July 8)
•  Average daily contracted volume in Japan's intraday electricity market fell 14.3% MoM to 16.8
GWh, marking the first decline in two months.
•  Monthly contracted volume dropped 17.1% to 504 GWh, with average daily transactions down
1.7% to 8,375, representing just 0.7% of total electricity demand across nine regional markets.
•  The average monthly contract price rose by ¥1.43 to ¥11.26/ kWh, ¥0.39 higher than the spot
market price; prices rose notably from mid-month amid greater cooling demand due to high
temperatures.


4



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The highest price recorded was ¥50/ kWh on June 17, reflecting tight supply-demand conditions as
temperatures climbed nationwide.



June heatwave spikes spot electricity demand in Japan
(Exchange data, June 8)
•  The electricity spot market saw sharp increases in buying bids in late June as persistent high
temperatures boosted demand, with buying volumes up 11.4% month-on-month.
•  Average daily buying volume reached 921.27 GWh, peaking in mid-to-late June amid hot weather
conditions, causing a brief narrowing of the supply-demand gap and pushing system prices to
monthly highs.
•  Nighttime supply rose notably by 8.8%, indicating recovery in thermal power generation ahead of
peak summer demand.



Enaris and Shibaura Tech continue research for supply-demand market

(Company statement, July 10)
•  Enaris, a subsidiary of KDDI, pledged to continue its research with Shibaura Institute of Technology
to advance resource control technologies.
•  This comes in anticipation of FY2026, when “low-voltage resources” such as EVs and residential
storage batteries will be permitted to participate in the supply-demand adjustment (i.e. balancing)
market. The goal is to expand the number of controllable low-voltage resources and further enhance
control precision.
•  The project will also leverage the computational capabilities of control terminals attached to
batteries and other devices.
•  CONTEXT: The research began in 2024 using Shibaura Institute’s distributed processing control
technology known as MEC-RM.
• TAKEAWAY: The aim is to improve control precision and increase the volume of adjustable capacity that can be
offered to the market. This should offer new balancing levers to TSOs, but will also make the calculations more
complex.



NEWS:    HYDROGEN



METI revises plans and budgets of some hydrogen/ ammonia projects
(Government statement, July 7)
•  METI has revised the plans and budgets of some hydrogen and ammonia-related projects supported

and the discovery of reducing agents, will be terminated due to a significant shortfall in achieving
targets. The total project budget will be revised from ¥71.27 billion to ¥69.8 billion.



MHIET launches sales of gas cogeneration system with hydrogen co-firing
(Company statement, July 4)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Engine & Turbocharger (MHIET) will launch a new gas cogeneration
system with a power output of 450 kW, capable of hydrogen co-firing, and jointly developed with
Toho Gas.
•  The hydrogen mixing ratio is set at a maximum of 15% to minimize the extent of modifications
required from conventional gas engines.
•  The system offers two operation modes: a city gas 13A-only mode and a hydrogen co-firing mode
that can be switched freely during load operation.
•  CONTEXT: In August 2021, the two companies completed Japan's first trial of a system with a power
output of 450 kW and a hydrogen co-firing ratio of 35%.



IHI and Vopak to develop ammonia import terminal

(Company statement, July 11)
•  IHI and Vopak will set up a JV to build and operate an ammonia terminal, aiming for commercial
operation by 2030. No location has yet been chosen.
•  The terminal development aims to facilitate the receiving and storing of imported ammonia within
Japan and to facilitate the establishment of a system for stable supply of such ammonia in Japan.
•  It will also serve as a hub for marine transportation.

NEWS:    WIND    POWER      AND   OTHER     RENEWABLES



Renova freezes new biomass development amid reduced subsidies, high costs
(Nikkei, July 11)
•  Renova will freeze development of new large-scale biomass power projects that use wood as fuel.
The decision comes as fuel costs remain high and government subsidy conditions are stricter.
•  Large-scale biomass projects using imported fuel are now ineligible for subsidies.
•  Moving forward, Renova will prioritize developing smaller-scale solar, battery storage, and onshore
wind projects, as well as improving profitability of its existing biomass operations.
•  CONTEXT: Biomass power generation expanded under the FIT, which began in 2012. Historically, fuel
for these projects has included domestic thinning materials and waste, as well as imported wood pellets
from North America and SE Asia.
•  JAPEX, which operates large-scale biomass facilities at four domestic locations, has also confirmed it
has no new development plans at present.
• TAKEAWAY: According to METI, the amount of woody biomass power generation eligible for state subsidies has
been decreasing year by year. In 2024, state subsidies for biomass power generation declined for the first time in
four years, attributed to fewer new plans, project cancellations, and the closure of power plants.

Mayor urges federal govt to take lead in selecting nuclear waste disposal sites
(Nikkei, July 9)
•  Mayor Kataoka Haruo of Suttsu, Hokkaido, said he’s concerned about the method of selecting final
disposal sites for nuclear waste. Suttsu was one of the first municipalities to complete the initial
literature survey phase.
•  He said the federal govt’s approach incites divisions in communities, as in his town.
•  Kataoka called for the national govt to choose many candidate sites and then seek cooperation from
local govts. This would put responsibility back on the national level, and could encourage debate
and greater public understanding.
• TAKEAWAY: The government has tried to utilize the ‘Scandinavian’ model of encouraging local governments to
declare their interest in hosting a nuclear waste hub in return for ample subsidies. However, as the Suttsu mayor
says, this has a number of drawbacks in Japan, where even small local opposition can derail huge infrastructure
initiatives. Many look to and even expect the national government to take responsibility for a major facility such

as a nuclear waste hub and it will likely require a more active Cabinet to bring to light. It should be noted,
however, that one reason the national government tries to steer clear of this topic is the fear that it will be taken
up as an issue by opposition parties and used to drive down government popularity.



Niigata Pref to survey public opinion on Kashiwazaki-Kariwa restart
(Nikkei, July 8)
•  In September, Niigata Pref will survey public opinion on the restart of TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
NPP.
•  This will help Gov Hanazumi’s decide whether or not to give consent for the restart.
•  Besides the survey, discussions with local mayors will conclude by Aug 7, and public hearings will
go on until Aug 31.
• TAKEAWAY: Last month TEPCO suspended efforts to restart Unit 7 due to delays in anti-terrorism facility
construction, subsequently unable to meet the stated deadline. Thus, the utility decided to shift focus to
preparing Unit 6, and it estimates two months are needed from the moment of approval to begin commercial
operation. However, a new public opinion survey further delays any potential restart date, now unlikely to
happen by year’s end.
This development also shows the ‘mastery’ of Gov Hanazumi, who has managed to delay and obfuscate the
restart issue for years. He has always hinted at wanting to shift the responsibility for greenlighting the restart to
the public and while his call for a referendum was denied by state officials, this public opinion survey is in fact a
similar move.

Japan’s warning over Australia's LNG politics, Cook visits Tokyo
(Financial Review, July 8)
•  West Australian Premier Roger Cook visited Japan to promote his region’s LNG exports and CCS
opportunities. The Australian govt is considering building an east coast gas reservation, raising
Japanese concerns that it could threaten energy security and long-term investment.
•  Australia is now prioritizing domestic gas supply, and Cook warns that investment in the sector
might drop if Australia restricts LNG exports.

9



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Japan is highly dependent on Australian LNG. West Australia alone has been a key supplier,
accounting for 28% of Japan’s total LNG imports in 2023. In total, all of Australia accounts for about
40% of Japan’s LNG imports.
•  Cook reassured Japan that West Australia remains a stable partner, as long as domestic gas supply
commitments are upheld.
•  Cook pointed to further trade opportunities with Japan in hydrogen, ammonia, and critical
minerals.



INPEX advances Abadi LNG project in Indonesia
(Nikkei Asia, July 9)
•  INPEX is advancing the $20 billion Abadi LNG project in Indonesia's Maluku province. It will
produce 9.5 Mtpa of LNG, making it Indonesia’s second-largest LNG project. Inpex (65% stake)
leads development with partners Pertamina and Petronas.
•  Construction could start in 2027, with production by the early 2030s. Gas will be drilled offshore
and piped 180 km to onshore liquefaction facilities. Inpex will need to hire 10,000 workers for full-
scale construction.
•  CONTEXT: Abadi could become a second major revenue source for INPEX, along with Ichthys LNG in
Australia, which currently accounts for 60% of profits.



Petronas ships first cargo from LNG Canada to Japan

(Company statement, July 8)
•  Petronas shipped its first cargo from the LNG Canada facility in Kitimat, British Columbia. The cargo
is headed to Japan.
•  With a 25% stake in the LNG Canada project, Petronas aims to diversify its supply portfolio. The
facility uses hydro-powered electricity and advanced methane control systems.
•  CONTEXT: LNG Canada is a JV of Shell, Petronas, PetroChina, Mitsubishi Corp and KOGAS. This is
Canada’s first major LNG project, with a 14 Mtpa capacity. Mitsubishi will offtake 15% (2.1 Mtpa) and
supply to Japan through its subsidiary, Diamond Gas International.



Alaska LNG eyes Asian markets
(Nikkei Asia, Japan NRG, July 8)
•  CONTEXT: The story covers the main status of the Alaska LNG project, noting that the backers are
making headway in planning the 1,300-km pipeline to transport gas from north Alaska to Anchorage.
From there, once a liquefaction plant is added, it can travel to Asia, with potential interest from Japan
and South Korea. The LNG plant's capacity is expected to be 20 Mtpa, equal to roughly 30% of Japan’s
yearly demand.
•  Alaska LNG operating company, Glenfarne plans to make a FID on the first phase of the project by
end of 2025. Gas deliveries to Anchorage should begin by late 2028, and LNG exports to Asia could
start in 2030.
•  The pipeline is considered one of the project’s top challenges. Construction costs are estimated at
$11 billion, about a quarter of the total $44 billion project cost.
•  Thailand’s PTT inked a non-binding deal to buy 2 Mtpa of LNG for 20 years. Taiwan’s CPC agreed in
principle to buy 6 Mtpa. Japanese and South Korean companies are reportedly also seen as likely
investors or buyers.

Chiyoda to shift away from megaprojects after LNG losses in the U.S.
(Nikkei, July 10)
•  Chiyoda Corp will no longer take on massive, overseas trillion-yen LNG projects, and will diversify
by focusing on smaller-scale projects, said company President Ota Koji.
•  In recent years, the company has been hit with heavy losses due to construction delays at Cameron
LNG, as well as losses with the Golden Pass LNG project, both in the U.S.
•  The Cameron LNG construction suffered from a labor shortage. Golden Pass LNG was a JV with U.S.
firm Zachry Industrial, which went bankrupt due to rising costs.
•  Chiyoda aims for an average consolidated net profit of ¥15 billion per year. It will strengthen risk
management at the contract stage. Traditional contracts required contractors to bear all post-signing

cost increases. This will now be re-evaluated together with customers for fairer risk-sharing.

NEWS:    CARBON      CAPTURE      & SYNTHETIC       FUELS



METI outlines safety measures for CO2 storage projects

(Government statement, July 10)
•  METI said that for the legal and regulatory carbon storage framework, three main approvals are
required: 1) CO2 Storage Project Permit; 2) Implementation Plan Approval; 3) and Safety
Regulations Submission and Review. These fall under the CCS Business Act.
•  Project operators must put in place safety measures on land excavation for storage projects and
must be careful of storage of CO2 in geological formations.
•  Safety measures include handling of explosives and fire hazards. These mirror measures for
exploratory drilling.
•  For permits and implementation plans, operators must prove technical and financial capabilities and
provide proper CO2 storage methods and monitoring, as well as measures to prevent leakage and
ensure safety. Finally, operators must show that there is no conflict with other industries or public
interest and no alternative disposal method in marine areas.
•  Monitoring needs to confirm CO2 storage conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature). Operators must
inject CO2 and conduct continuous monitoring.
•  The Safety Subcommittee will continue reviewing safety obligations for CO2 storage. They will
reference international standards and Japan's Tomakomai demo project. The goal is to complete the
guidelines at least by the end of summer.

Dynamic Duo: Japan and Singapore Drive Energy in East Asia
News and analysis about Japan’s foreign relations in the energy sector are often
dominated by partnerships and deals with Australia, China, Qatar, the U.S., and UAE.
Rarely does the bilateral relationship between Japan and Singapore garner much
attention.

But these two countries, despite their differences, have developed a potent tandem that’s
driving developments in regional and global energy markets in ways that don’t always
grab headlines. While energy deals between the two countries don’t register in billion-
dollar figures – as they do with Australia and the U.S. – Tokyo’s relationship with
Singapore is a cornerstone of regional energy cooperation and development in East Asia.
Despite contrasting geographic profiles, both nations are resource-scarce and function
with trade-dependent economies. As well as becoming energy hubs, Japan and
Singapore also share a deep dependence on thermal power plants and, hitherto, a strong
reliance on natural gas. Today, however, they are united in exploring alternatives in
hydrogen, battery energy storage, and pioneering the energy transition in the region.

Japan’s technological prowess in CCS, hydrogen, and renewables complements
Singapore’s financial, trading and logistical strengths. Japan NRG explores their
collaborative efforts in a number of sectors and the impact across the Asia Pacific.

LNG and foundations of energy cooperation
The convergence of business needs – Japan as a major energy consumer and Singapore
as a critical node in energy trade – is the bedrock of this half-century partnership.
Singapore’s location along major maritime shipping lanes and its development of Jurong
Island as a hub for energy and petrochemicals since the 1960s have made it a vital
partner for Japan.
Despite determined efforts in greening its energy sector, Japan remains heavily reliant
on LNG imports for power generation. In addition, Japanese companies are increasingly
looking for LNG trading opportunities to countries across Asia. Singapore plays a pivotal
role as a hub, hosting LNG trading operations for companies such as JERA, Japan’s
largest utility, as well as global majors such as BP, and ExxonMobil.

In March, the city-state’s importance for Japan’s energy strategy was ramped up a notch
when the natural gas and coal trading operations of JERA merged with France’s EDF to
form the Singapore-based firm JERA Global Markets – 66.7% owned by JERA, with the
remaining stake held by EDF Trading.
Investments in Singapore’s energy infrastructure
The second pillar of Japan-Singapore energy relations is the ownership and operation of
Singapore’s energy assets, particularly in electricity generation.

In late 2008, Marubeni led a consortium that included Kyushu Electric, Kansai Electric, the
Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC), and GDF Suez (now Engie) to acquire
Senoko Power from Singapore state-owned Temasek Holdings. The consortium, known as
Lion Power Holdings, was controlled by Marubeni and Engie holding 30% each.

In late June, trading house Marubeni increased its stake in Senoko from 30% to 50% by
acquiring the Lion Power shares from Kyushu Electric, KEPCO, and JBIC. Senoko, with

its 2.6 GW capacity, supplies about 18% of Singapore’s electricity, making it the state’s
second largest power provider.

That deal has positioned Marubeni as a 50/50 co-owner along with Sembcorp Utilities, a
subsidiary of Singapore’s state-owned Sembcorp Industries. This deal highlights
deepening trust and collaboration between firms from the two nations, leading to a
symbiotic dynamic – meeting Singapore’s need for stable electricity with Japan’s
constant pursuit of overseas investment opportunities.
Finally, Japanese investors in Singapore’s power sector are a counterbalance to Chinese
firms. Huaneng Power International owns Tuas Power, the city-state’s largest power
company, with a 20% market share.

BESS and AI boom in Japan
Both nations are investing heavily in renewable energy and energy storage. Singapore-
based firms with backing from global investors – such as Peak Energy, Gurīn Energy,
and Vena Energy – are making significant inroads into Japan’s renewables market,
particularly in solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS).
The ambitions of Singaporean players align with Japan’s push to combine renewable
energy with advanced technology, particularly as AI and digital services drive energy
consumption.

In mid June, Peak Energy acquired a portfolio of ready-to-build, high-voltage solar farms
in Tokyo and Tohoku, with a combined capacity of 48 MW. These facilities, equipped
with BESS, are set to be operational between 2026 and 2028 and will supply power to
corporate customers through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).

Also in mid June, Gurīn Energy, in collaboration with France’s Saft (a TotalEnergies
subsidiary), said it is developing a project in Soma City, Fukushima Prefecture, that will
provide over 1 GWh of storage capacity to integrate renewables into Japan’s grid.
In late May, Vena Energy added to its 1 GW of operating solar capacity in Japan, as well
as wind and battery ambitions, by creating a data center subsidiary, Vena Nexus. The
new entity has some Japanese assets in its pipeline and among these is a partnership
with Tokyo-based startup Quantum Mesh, with whom Vena is developing small-scale,
renewables-powered data centers for AI-driven and digital infrastructure.

Vena Energy’s ambitions extend beyond Tokyo, but the Japanese business is one of the
firm’s largest.

Rooftop solar, transition finance and eye on India
Singapore’s role as a financial and operational hub underscores its importance as a
springboard for Japanese players to connect with other Asian markets.
In early June, TEPCO, in partnership with Hong Kong’s ESR Group, secured ¥1.1 billion
in financing from Taiwan’s Bank SinoPac for a 10 MW rooftop solar project in
Singapore, with plans to expand to 40 MW through an additional ¥3.9 billion.

Supported by multiple corporate PPAs, this joint venture reflects TEPCO’s goal to deploy
100 MW of rooftop solar across the Asia-Pacific, leveraging Singapore’s favorable
investment climate and demand for clean energy.

Japan’s Climate Transition Bonds (also known as GX Bonds) have been highlighted by
the International Energy Agency (IEA) as a model for emerging economies, offering

15



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

government-backed credit support to facilitate clean energy spending. As a global
financial center, Singapore can play a role in facilitating the trading of GX Bonds.

The Japanese government aims to issue ¥20 trillion worth of GX bonds over the next
decade to support decarbonization across multiple sectors. A significant portion of the
proceeds (over 50%) is allocated to energy transition R&D.
Meanwhile, firms from Japan and Singapore are exploring joint investments in third
countries to counterbalance the limitations and even shrinking in their domestic
businesses. As part of Osaka Gas's broader strategy to expand its energy business in
emerging markets, Osaka Gas Singapore has invested in Singapore-based AG&P City
Gas, which is developing 12 city gas distribution concessions in South India and
Rajasthan. (The company’s subsidiary in India is known as AG&P Pratham.)

In 2024, AG&P secured exclusive gas distribution rights covering 10% of India’s land
area, and targets annual sales of 3.5 billion cubic meters by 2030. Toward that goal, the
company is laying a 100 km gas pipeline in Chennai. But it’s also expanding into
renewables, planning to develop 400 MW solar and wind power capacity in India by
2028.
This robust international strategy, driven by Japan’s shrinking domestic market, saw
Osaka Gas’s non-Japan revenue surge from ¥18.7 billion in FY2016 to ¥116.4 billion in
FY2024.

CCS partnership
In August 2024, during the 2nd Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) meeting in
Indonesia, METI Minister Saito Ken and Singapore’s Second Minister for Trade and
Industry, Dr. Tan See Leng, agreed to cooperate on carbon capture and storage.

Japan, a leader in CCS technology innovation, is well placed to support Singapore’s
ambitions to decarbonize its energy-intensive industries, including power generation,
chemicals, and waste management.
Constrained by limited land and domestic renewable energy potential, Singapore views
CCS as a vital tool for reducing emissions while maintaining its role as a regional energy
hub. The two countries will develop common standards for CCS, fostering a market for
CCS solutions across the Asia-Pacific.

Conclusion
While only a city-state with a population of just under six million, nearly 21 times less
than Japan’s 125 million people, Singapore occupies an outsized place in Japan’s
regional energy strategy.
While much is said about Singapore’s geographic location, part of its allure for Japanese
players is the state’s high levels of efficiency and services, and low levels of corruption.
The stability of local business relations is another trait valued by Japanese firms.
(Singapore ranks No 3 globally for least corruption; while Japan ranks 20th.)

Of course, Singapore has attracted investors from various locations due its finance and
trade focus. That kind of international environment, and a cosmopolitan lifestyle, has
endeared the city-state to many of Japan’s business and financial elite.

It is the similarity of Singapore’s approach to energy – the focus on security of supply
and affordability, in addition to decarbonization – and the proximity to the fast-growing
markets of Indonesia and Malaysia, for example, that has led Japanese energy
companies to consider the city state a vital hub for their Asian business expansion.

The Balancing Act for Energy Planners Continues a Decade into Reforms
In late March, the energy agency (ANRE) published its long-awaited review of electricity
market reforms carried out over the past decade, and set out future priorities. The
results indicate success in achieving the main aims of ensuring a stable power supply,
reigning in power rates, all while offering consumers more choice.

Yet beneath this positive headline lies a critical challenge: how to ensure sufficient
capacity and stability in ever more sophisticated power markets without giving up on
the energy transition?

ANRE’s review also underscored persistent vulnerabilities, especially around maintaining
adequate supply and stable prices as Japan pushes ahead with the twin national
strategies: digital transformation (DX) and green transformation (GX). These strategies
aim for a rapid shift toward decarbonized infrastructure, but also place greater strain on
Japan’s already tight electricity grid – a concern echoed in this year’s 7th Basic Energy
Plan.
Japan NRG takes a deeper look at the agency’s concerns and how they relate to the main
developments in the electricity sector and markets.

Supply capacity shortage
In recent years, a number of factors worry Japanese energy planners regarding available
power supply and capacity. First, the decommissionings and suspension of aging thermal
power plants has gained momentum. At the same time, the rollout of renewables and
new thermal power sources has not kept pace with state targets, resulting in a
discrepancy between supply and demand.
Over the past decade, Japan has reduced reliance on thermal power generation, with a
net loss of about 21 GW of LNG, coal, and oil-fired capacity. Meanwhile, new solar
capacity coming online has slowed, dropping to about 6 GW a year in 2022, from a high
of nearly 11 GW in 2015. This is partly due to less land availability, rising costs, the
phasing out of tariffs, and an intensifying grass-roots opposition in certain localities due
to resident concerns.

Second, structural changes on the demand side have had an impact. Prolonged summer
heat and winter cold, combined with economic recovery after the Covid pandemic, have
led to rapid increases in electricity demand, making it more likely for peak demand to
exceed initial projections. This has resulted in growing instances of a decline in reserve
margins.
In summer 2024, for example, there were at least three incidents when large volumes of
electricity had to be transferred quickly between the major regions into which Japan's
power system is split. On July 1, Kansai's transmission system operator warned that its
reserve margin was due to fall below 3%, a red line; Kansai received nearly 1.5 GW of
power from the Chubu region to improve the power balance.

Third, there is a shortage of balancing capacity in the supply-demand adjustment
market, the Electric Power Reserve Exchange (ERPX), that helps to cope with the output
fluctuations of renewable energy. The rollout of flexible resources such as storage

17



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

batteries is taking time, especially because of grid connection bottlenecks and trouble
with raising project financing.

Meanwhile, the cost of expanding pumped hydro storage – where possible – is
substantial. This has led to situations where sudden imbalances in power supply and
demand cannot be promptly addressed.
The gaps in the EPRX market could be illustrated by tracking the procurement ratio for
its various products. In other words, by considering how much certain power generation
sources are underutilized while others are over-relied upon. Based on the procurement
ratio for each EPRX product during FY2024, which is calculated by dividing the daily
contracted capacity by the solicited capacity (i.e. required balancing capacity), we can
see:
• Clear shortage of capacity for certain types of energy;
• Reliability concerns when integrating variable power sources;
• Frequent forecast errors or grid fluctuations that need rapid response;
• Challenges in forecasting short-term balancing needs or intermittent asset
availability.

The outcome of the above suggests there are opportunities to invest further in fast-
response technologies like BESS that can support the consistently high and volatile
secondary reserve categories, which offer drive price premiums and potentially attractive
returns.

Measures for stable electricity supply
To ensure a stable electricity supply, the government is working on institutional
measures, such as the capacity market, the long-term decarbonized power sources
auction (LTDA), and development of short-term markets.

The current capacity market system is designed to secure future supply capacity through
bidding and contracting four years in advance. However, incentives for suppliers are
limited. In response, revisions are being made to enhance supply effectiveness, including
commitments for dispatchable resources and differentiated treatment based on the
results of effectiveness tests.
The LTDA was introduced to achieve secure, decarbonized supply capacity, thereby
encouraging investment by providing long-term revenue stability for cleaner power
sources expected to play a big part in future electricity supply (e.g., offshore wind,
nuclear power, etc). The LTDA has so far held two rounds and a third is expected to
begin in autumn.

For the short-term market, the introduction of a simultaneous market is under
consideration, where supply capacity (kWh) and balancing capability (delta-kW) are
contracted simultaneously. This enables optimal resource allocation based on
information provided by power generators (such as startup costs, minimum output costs,
and incremental cost curves), while taking into account transmission constraints.
Ensuring stability in both supply volume and price
Achieving a stable electricity supply requires a balanced approach to both volume and
price.

Reliable supply capacity must be maintained over the medium to long term, and this
involves promoting new power sources, extending the life of existing facilities, and
expanding flexible resources such as storage batteries and demand response
mechanisms.
On the other hand, according to the ANRE review, extreme fluctuations in power prices
pose risks for both consumers and businesses. Japanese power officials worry that the
current power market design relies too heavily on spot market price signals, which has
in the past three years or so led to the collapse of many electricity retailers when prices
surged.

To address this issue, officials want to see retailers and other power participants utilize a
broader range of contracting options. This includes making more use of the baseload
market, futures contracts, and paying more attention to bilateral options such as PPAs.

Future discussions
Following the presentation of ANRE’s review in March, the “Subcommittee for the
Development of Next-Generation Electricity and Gas System Infrastructure” was
established to examine the future institutional framework, business environment,
market structure, and competitive landscape for the electricity and gas industries.
Also, in June the "Working Group on Institutional Design Based on the Review of the
Electric Power System Reform" was formed to engage in more detailed discussions on
policy and system design.

The subcommittee and working group will grapple with the following eight issues.
1.  Securing fuel necessary for stable supply
2.  Planned development of intra-area transmission systems
3.  Facilitating financing for large-scale transmission system development
4.  Development of markets enabling optimal short-term supply-demand operation
5.  Clarifying the responsibilities, roles, and discipline of retail electricity providers
6.  Markets and mechanisms to promote medium- to long-term transactions
7.  Identifying issues related to the removal of transitional tariffs
8.  Financing for investments in power sources and transmission systems
Items 1, 4, and 6 are issues related to ensuring stability of power supply.

Conclusion
While electricity system reform has brought diversity and efficiency to the market,
officials feel the fundamental issue of creating and maintaining stable power supply
needs further measures.
Policy focus seems likely to double down on supporting new, and ideally flexible,
capacity installations both over the short and the medium term, with subsidy
mechanisms attuned to that. Market and regulatory designs will be geared toward
encouraging new investment.

Many familiar with operations in mature power markets overseas continue to hope for
more bold measures in market design, such as the introduction of negative pricing.
ANRE’s focus on supply and price stability does not suggest the energy planners are keen
to introduce such approaches in Japan as yet.

Still, with more and cleaner capacity required, an evolution in domestic energy policy is
likely as long as the government feels confident that the changes will not pass along
undue price volatility to the population.
