NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY







Top banks set core criteria to finance hydrogen projects, long-term offtake agreement is vital
(Japan NRG, Oct 17)
•  To get financing for a hydrogen project, Japan’s top banks stated these conditions:
•  The technology is approved as a valid decarbonization tool by the govt;
•  The reduction in CO2 emissions can be monitored and measured/ confirmed;

•  There’s a long-term offtake agreement with a buyer.
•  Other factors will be the project’s ability to qualify for state subsidies that make the clean fuel
affordable, said Japan’s top three banks (known as “megabanks”) during Connecting Green
Hydrogen Japan 2023.
•  Japanese banks are willing to finance hydrogen and related projects at home and globally, as long
as one entity is Japanese, said Fujiki Masayuki, head of Structured Finance at MUFG Bank.
•  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is creating specialist funds to finance hydrogen projects, said

Kaneko Tadahiro, senior assistant to the head of global banking.



Japan’s 2030 hydrogen price target is no longer “feasible”: Mitsubishi
(Japan NRG, Oct 18)
•  Amid rising costs, the govt’s 2030 target to reduce the price of imported hydrogen to $2-3/ kg

“isn’t feasible anymore,” said Fujimoto Kiichiro, the GM of hydrogen infrastructure development at
Mitsubishi Corporation.
•  Japan will try to find ways to reduce the cost of producing and importing hydrogen and related
fuels, but the current market can’t be ignored, said Fujimoto, speaking at Connecting Green
Hydrogen Japan 2023.
•  Mitsubishi is developing hydrogen projects globally and remains open to dealing with all hydrogen
carrier technologies, Fujimoto said. “We don’t think there’s a clear winner at this stage.”

•  CONTEXT: Japan’s latest iteration of the national hydrogen strategy, released in summer, has kept
the govt’s original target of lowering the cost of imported hydrogen to $2/ kg, and domestically
manufactured to $4/ kg. These levels are several times lower than what’s estimated by clean
hydrogen project developers outside Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: At the same conference, an advisor on GX matters to Mitsubishi Group, Endo Hidetaka, said that
the cost of domestic hydrogen projects is now as high as $6-$9/ kg, making them uncompetitive with imports.

Most of Japan’s hydrogen production would rely on electrolysis powered by renewables (or in the future
nuclear stations). The cost of electricity generated by renewables in Japan is higher than in most other
countries, which consequently pushes up the cost of hydrogen production.

Australia’s GFG Alliance ready to export green steel to Japan without a premium
(Japan NRG, Australian Financial Review, Oct 17)
•  GFG Alliance, which seeks to transform its steelworks from coal-based to clean hydrogen, is willing
to export “green” steel products at prices similar to those now made using fossil fuels.
•  The company won’t initially seek a premium from buyers, and will structure pricing to reflect

today’s market in order to capture demand, said Theuns Victor, head of GFG’s Liberty Primary
Metals, speaking at Connecting Green Hydrogen Japan 2023.
•  The company is expanding steelworks and mining at its Whyalla site in Australia, and is in talks with
Japanese steelmakers and traders interested in these assets, said Victor. Japanese interest is both
in terms of offtake for products and as investments.




Tokyo Stock Exchange wants to create futures market for carbon credits
(Japan NRG, Oct 18)
•  Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) would like to facilitate trading in futures contracts for the carbon
market, said Ishizaki Takashi, CEO of TOCOM, a part of TSE, during a power market seminar.
•  TSE will study market models in Europe and North America.
•  CONTEXT: TSE began trading carbon credits on Oct 11. Registered members can trade the

existing carbon credit, known as J-Credit.
•  So far, close to 200 companies have registered in the carbon market, Ishizaki said.



GHG emissions from cross-holdings likely to affect stock prices

(Nikkei, Oct 19)
•  Climate-change information disclosures will likely further affect Japanese company stock
evaluations, amid a growing focus on Scope 3 emissions — those emissions from entire supply
chains.
•  For Japanese companies, GHGs emitted by companies in which they have invested as part of their
business will likely affect their own stock prices.
•  For example, when taking into account the emissions of companies in which real estate developer

Sumitomo Realty holds cross-holdings, its emissions are 2.6 times higher. Toyota Industries is
another whose Scope 1-3 emissions would double if the emissions related to its shareholdings are
taken into account.



Companies see minimal benefits from net-zero transition, despite govt efforts

(Teikoku Data Bank, Oct 13)
•  Japan aims for carbon neutrality by 2050, through legal mandates and establishing the Japan In-
house Counsel Network (JICN).
•  GHG emissions increased 2% since 2020, but dropped 20.3% over 2013.
•  In August, over ¥1.2 trillion was allocated in 2024's budget for decarbonization and private sector
involvement.

•  However, a survey indicates only 6.8% of companies feel a positive impact, with over 70% seeing
no impact or unsure of the benefits.
• TAKEAWAY: PM Kishida, and his predecessors, have been keen to stress that the move to net zero / carbon
neutrality / GX will be a plus for the economy. That messaging was important because many industrials in
Japan saw the transformation as a cost item. The mood had appeared to shift from 2020, but it’s fair to say

that few companies have as yet developed sizable businesses for the carbon-neutral era. In Japan, most clean
energy projects are still at a pilot stage or in early commercialization. So, they have yet to show their financial
benefit.




Energy subsidies to continue into new year: METI minister
(Japan NRG, Oct 20)
•  METI Minister Nishimura said gasoline and power subsidies will be extended for a second time, as
gasoline prices hit record highs, amid increased winter demand.
•  Next week the govt will make an economic package with new subsidies.
•  Such subsidies, which began in January 2022, were supposed to end in September 2023 but were

extended through December.
•  Nishimura said an exit strategy from the subsidies is needed, but he didn’t elaborate.
• TAKEAWAY: As noted several times in our Data Book reports, the exit from energy subsidies is very hard to
create because in addition to high fossil fuel prices, Japan is suffering from a weak yen. In effect, the energy
subsidies are covering the currency depreciation, which is a macroeconomic factor, more than energy
fundamentals.




METI doubles EV charging station goal

(Government statement, Oct 18)
•  METI officially updated plans for EV charging stations, including a new goal of 300,000 charging
stations by 2030, double the previous goal.
•  METI will promote chargers with higher output, averaging 80 kW. Existing charging stations have
40 kW output on average.
•  METI may introduce auctions for subsidies to prioritize cost-effective projects.




JERA, JGC and PLN ink MoU on CCS at Indonesian power plants
(Company statement, Oct 19)
•  JERA, JGC Holdings, and the Indonesian State Electricity Company (PLN) signed an MoU for a
study on CCS projects at PLN's thermal power plants.
•  They’ll explore the feasibility, technical, and legal aspects of introducing CCS at coal and gas-fired

power plants, with JGC focusing on storage technologies and cost estimation; PLN will work on
data provision and local coordination.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The study will receive funding from METI under a new initiative promoting overseas infrastructure
development by Japanese firms.
• TAKEAWAY: Indonesia is the only ASEAN country with a legislative framework on CCS at the national level.
Together with funding from METI and technical support from Japanese trading houses, this is a strong
foundation for CCS development in that country.




MHI begins demo for CO2 liquefaction system

(Company statement, Oct 16)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), along with two subsidiaries, began a demo to test a system
liquefying captured CO2 from gas engine generator sets. Held at the Sagamihara Plant, it utilizes a
compact CO2 capture and liquefaction system.
•  The liquefied CO2 is easily transportable and helps in adopting CCUS technologies.
•  Support services will be verified using MHI's remote monitoring, continuing a CO2 capture demo
launched in 2022. The goal is to learn about handling liquefied CO2 and develop a fully integrated

customer support system from capture to liquefaction.



KEPCO and JFE Steel sign MoU to conduct CO2 capture study
(Company statement, Oct 19)
•  KEPCO and JFE Steel signed an MoU to study the capture, liquefaction, storage, and
transportation of CO2 emissions from their power plants and steel mills to underground storage

sites.
•  This study will address technical and cost-related challenges.
• TAKEAWAY: While some energy transition experts see CCS as unacceptable since it seeks to prolong the
operations of carbon-intensive industries, others see it as the optimal solution for hard to decarbonize
processes like steelmaking, which accounts for about 40% of CO2 emissions in the industrial sector.




Enecoat, Mitsui Fudosan, Kyoto Univ to develop residential PSC
(Company statement, Oct 17)
•  Enecoat Technologies, Mitsui Fudosan Residential and Kyoto University began research on

perovskite solar cells (PSC) for the residential market. They’ll install PSC on Mitsui Fudosan condos
to test performance and safety.
•  CONTEXT: PSC made of perovskite crystals are lighter, thinner and could be more flexibly shaped
compared to silicon panels. However, silicon panels have also become lighter and thinner as panel
manufacturers focus on the residential market on the back of tighter solar farm regulations.

Mitsubishi Chemical cuts solar panel recycling costs by 20-30%
(Nikkei, Oct 19)
•  Mitsubishi Chemical Group developed a solar panel recycling process that cuts costs by 20-30%.

Shinryo, a group company in Kitakyushu City, will recycle the panels.
•  The process involves heating and gasifying the sealing materials, to break apart the panel
components without crushing.
•  Shinryo plans to triple its recycling capacity to 4,300 tons /year by 2030. It will double its
Kitakyushu plant capacity and build new plants on the premises of Mitsubishi Chemical.
•  CONTEXT: NEDO forecasts that 170,000-280,000 tons of panels will be recycled in 2030, surging
from 3,000 tons in 2020.
• TAKEAWAY: Treatment of the sealing materials has been the most labor-intensive process of panel recycling.

According to NEDO, the best available technologies had achieved a ¥5/ watt recycling cost before Mitsubishi
Chemical’s development.




Marubeni partners with the Philippines to pioneer low-carbon district cooling technology
(Company statement, Oct 9)
•  The Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) in the Philippines joined forces with
United District Energy International (UDEI) and Marubeni to research low-carbon district cooling
technologies for New Clark City.
•  The collaboration seeks to address high energy consumption during the hot season in Central

Luzon. District cooling systems, which are alternatives to traditional air conditioners, will be
studied.
•  An MoU was signed for a feasibility study to gauge the technology’s potential. If implemented,
these systems could reduce electricity consumption by up to 50%.

(Company statement, Oct 18)
•  Primetals Technologies (MHI Group) will conduct a decarbonization study for China Steel Corp
(CSC), focusing on the Kaohsiung site in Taiwan.

•  The site is Taiwan’s largest, producing 10 million tons of crude steel per year.
•  Primetals Technologies will provide expert consulting and a detailed report outlining
decarbonization strategies.



Cosmo, Sekisui Chemical partner in SAF production using carbon emission as feed

(Company statement, Oct 18)
•  Cosmo Energy and Sekisui Chemical agreed to study applications of Sekisui’s “chemical looping
reaction” technology for producing SAF and other clean fuels.
•  It converts CO2 into carbon monoxide at a 90% conversion rate, which is then used as feedstock
for methanol and ethanol that’s processed into synthetic fuels and SAF.
•  The companies will explore using CO2 emissions from Cosmo oil refineries in Japan to produce
clean fuels.




Tokyo Gas, Calbee to test biogas production from potato chip waste
(Company statement, Oct 19)
•  Tokyo Gas, Tokyo Gas Engineering Solutions and Calbee began testing biogas production from
potato chip waste, which, after fermentation, will generate biogas to be used as fuel to generate

power.
• TAKEAWAY: This development shows the spread of waste recycling in the food sector. The ideas are diverse:
apple waste mixed with chemicals to make “vegan leather”, peanut skins for car seat covers, etc. However,
they’re not all sustainable and some are costly. Biogas production requires heat to store the feedstock at 35-
40°C, which is problematic in winter.




JFTC asks PET recycling association to improve competition
(Government statement, Oct 16)
•  The Japan Fair Trade Commission has asked the Japan Containers and Recycling Association to

improve competition in the used plastic bottles and packaging market by opening the
association’s auctions to wider participation.
•  The JFTC request reflected the results of its fact-finding survey on the plastic bottle recycling
practices and material flow.
• TAKEAWAY: About 19% of waste is recycled and the govt aims to raise that figure. The JFTC move will help
build proper market mechanisms in the recycling sector.

METI unveils plan to mitigate renewables curtailment, seeks to stimulate daytime demand
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 17)
•  METI and ANRE unveiled a new strategy to reduce curtailment of renewable energy, which has

become more frequent nationwide.
•  The proposal calls for taking budgetary measures and improving system design in residential and
industrial sectors; it involves promoting power demand during the day with discounted electricity
rates and expanding the range of pricing options.
•  Also, it calls for utilizing pumped-storage during times of surplus renewables energy production
and for generating electricity during the evening and night.
•  As far as grid reinforcement, the plan calls for revising operation of interconnector gates / lines to

expand the volume of electricity that can be transmitted outside the home region. The final version
of this new strategy will be completed by year’s end.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO outlines plan for solar power curtailment in FY2024
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 18)
o  TEPCO Power Grid outlined its plans for solar power curtailment in FY2024. It forecasts
1.51 MW of curtailment on the 154,000 V Joetsu trunk line and 66,000 V Tamamoro line

for non-firm power sources.
o  A uniform control method will be used to maintain a consistent proportion of output
reduction to the power generation plan. This approach allocates curtailment in 30 minute
intervals based on a pro rata calculation of required volumes versus planned generation
volumes.
o  In the future, TEPCO PG will also require facilities that have a high possibility of being

curtailed to submit individual power generation plans.
o  The uniform control method is undergoing test runs this fiscal year. The power control
system will be updated and modified next year and is expected to transition fully to the
new curtailment methodology from as soon as January 2025.



JGC to enter power market by installing PSC on third-party warehouse roofs, walls

(Nikkei, Oct 22)
•  Engineering giant JGC Holdings will rent space on the roofs and walls of other companies' logistics
warehouses and factories, install perovskite solar cell (PSC) equipment, and start supplying
electricity. JGC will use cells made by Enecoat.
•  The company is keen to enter the power business and sees PSC as the basis for a business model
for “power generation anywhere” technology.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  JGC will also consider delivering electricity through power lines to factories and logistics
warehouses other than those where solar cells are installed. In this case, it will need to get a METI
license as an electricity retailer.
•  In 2024, JGC will run a demonstration test for this business by installing PSC at a distribution
warehouse in Tomakomai City, Hokkaido. Large-scale use is slated for 2026.




New electricity ranking: Tokyo Gas maintains top spot amid low sales
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 20)
•  According to power demand data for May compiled by METI and ANRE, the number of new
electricity providers decreased by six compared to the previous month to total 673 providers. Of
these, only 512 providers had actually recorded sales.

•  The total electricity sales volume of new electricity providers (the so-called shin denryoku)
decreased by 10.4% to 8,525 GWh. Low-voltage sales decreased by 13.3%, high-voltage by 8.0%,
and extra-high voltage by 2.2%.
•  In the low-voltage category, many new electricity providers fell short of their sales performance
from the previous month. The period from April to May saw a lull in electricity demand. In April,
the weather was warm nationwide.
•  In the high-voltage category, the leading companies showed a noticeable decline in sales, with

ENNet (1st place) and Eneres Power Marketing (8th place) especially experiencing a significant
drop in sales volume.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Sales of new electricity providers decreased by 21.4%; share in the 16% range
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 19)
o  According to the Electricity and Gas Trading Monitoring Committee, sales of electricity in

July were 6,882 GWh, down 3.2% compared to a year earlier (but up 16% month-on-
month).
o  New electricity providers, on the other hand, saw a 21.4% decrease in the same period,
amounting to 1,138 GWh (but up 24.8% MoM). This marks the tenth consecutive month
of double-digit decreases on a YoY basis.
o  As far as electricity sales volume in July, the share of new electricity providers was 16.5%,

which is a decrease of 3.9 points compared to the previous month (an increase of 1.1
points from the previous month).

•  They’ll also invest in additional transformers at various locations, and plan to increase transformer
capacity at substations and expand transmission lines.



Mitsubishi quits Japan Wind Power Association

(Sankei, Oct 19)
•  Mitsubishi Corporation Offshore Wind and Mitsubishi Corporation Clean Energy quit the Japan
Wind Power Association on Oct 10, claiming it had gaps in “perception” with the association that
remain unresolved.
•  The JWDA, along with lawmaker Akimoto Masatoshi, pushed for changes in offshore auction rules
after a Mitsubishi consortium won all three main offshore wind project auctions in 2021. Akimoto
was indicted for alleged bribery.

• TAKEAWAY: Due to the outcry and controversy that followed Japan’s first offshore wind auction in December
2021, the auction rules were changed in December 2022. One of the biggest changes was to make the
electricity price offered by the project developer less important in the evaluation of their plan. Another change
was to limit how much capacity one company could bid for at the same time. With these new rules in place,
the standout winner of that Round 1 auctions, Mitsubishi, chose not to participate in Round 2.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JWD officials resign from Japan Wind Power Association board
(JWPA statement, Oct 19)
o  Japan Wind Development and its officials who served as board members have left the

Japan Wind Power Association, effective Oct 18.
o  ANRE has advised third-party reviews of JWPA activities, and the association will conduct
reforms.
o  CONTEXT: METI has suspended the company Japan Wind Development, which had
allegedly financed Akimoto, from auction participation during the period Sept 29 to June
29, 2024.

Tohoku Electric conducts demo test mixing hydrogen with LNG
(Nikkei, Oct 19)
•  Tohoku Electric conducted a demo test at the Niigata Thermal Power Plant, mixing 1% hydrogen
by volume with LNG. The test aims to analyze data and advance the practical use of hydrogen-

based thermal power generation.
•  This co-firing test will run until March 2025, with plans to increase the number of demo tests.
•  The mixture of hydrogen and LNG results in a 0.3% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to using
only LNG as a fuel.
• TAKEAWAY: The CO2 reduction is small, but the goal is to increase the ratio of hydrogen over time. If the
CO2 footprint of the hydrogen is low, then it could enable the reduction of emissions from thermal power
generation. However, these are very early days and in addition to the environmental benefits there are

questions over the cost of this approach.



Hokkaido Governor won’t budge on nuclear waste disposal sites surveys

(Nikkei, Oct 18)
•  Speaking in Tokyo, Hokkaido Governor Suzuki Naomichi reiterated his opposition to hosting in his
prefecture a preliminary survey for selecting the final disposal site for high-level radioactive waste
from reactors.
•  CONTEXT: The selection of a final nuclear waste disposal site requires three stages, the first of
which is currently ending in the locality of Suttsu (Hokkaido), where a council election was held on

Oct 3. Five candidates in favor of continuing the review process were elected, securing a majority.
But proceeding to the next stage of the preliminary survey also requires the prefectural governor's
consent.
• TAKEAWAY: The governor's position cites a prefectural ordinance that discourages the import of nuclear
waste into the region. Central and local govt representatives in favor of the surveys claim that at this stage the
surveys do not violate this ordinance. However, this only seems to be a way of buying time.




Hokkaido panel divided on 650 MW Rumoi wind project review

(Japan NRG, Oct 20)
•  The Hokkaido environmental panel, which reviews wind projects and writes recommendations to
the governor, is divided on the review results of the 650 MW Rumoi Wide Area Wind Project
planned by Eurus Energy.
•  On Oct 2, the nine panel members discussed Eurus’ proposed environmental assessment
methodology before writing a recommendation to the Hokkaido governor.
•  The draft of the recommendation said the proposed Eurus methodology lacked clarity. The project
is divided into four areas, but no details on the facility installations were given. It also urged Eurus

to rewrite the survey methodology. The final recommendation will reflect the Oct 2 discussions.

NEWS:     OIL,  GAS   &  MINING






World must invest $7 trillion in infrastructure to avoid gas shortages, says Japan think tank

(Bloomberg, Oct 20)
•  The world will need $7 trillion to ensure sufficient gas supply through 2050 as nations shift to
cleaner energy sources, according to the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan.
•  As countries look to cut emissions and shift to gas from dirtier coal, investments will go to develop
new gas fields, construction of new LNG export facilities, and expansion of existing plants,
according to the IEEJ report.
•  The scenario assumes the world will move to reduce emissions by 56% by 2050, and that emerging
nations won’t be able to hit carbon neutrality by mid-century, the IEEJ said.

•  CONTEXT: After a boom period from 2000 to 2021, the world's gas markets have entered a more
uncertain period marked by slower growth and greater volatility. This is due to both global efforts
to end the use of fossil fuels and transition to clean energy, as well as geopolitical tensions
between G7 nations and Russia.
• TAKEAWAY: Competing agendas have complicated forecasts for the use of fossil fuels and their planned
phase-out. These contrasting outlooks on natural gas demand in the coming years make companies hesitant to
invest in new supply. The IEA sees gas demand peaking this decade and says no new projects are required.

But leading natural gas producers, such as Chevron and Shell, say that gas will play a long-term role in the
energy transition, especially as countries shift away from coal.




ADNOC  Gas signs LNG deal with JERA Global Markets

•  This deal is part of plans to boost UAE-Japan energy relations. Following a similar deal with JAPEX

and other international agreements, ADNOC is growing its global presence, notably in East and
South Asian markets. In August, ADNOC invested $3.6 billion to enhance gas processing, with
expanded production at home in the UAE.
•  CONTEXT: In July, PM Kishida visited the UAE and other nearby countries to improve existing
partnerships on energy supplies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mitsui mulls stake in Qatar's LNG expansion project

o  CONTEXT: In 2022, Japan was the top global LNG importer, primarily sourcing from the
Middle East. During a visit to Qatar in July, PM Kishida emphasized enhancing energy
and economic collaboration.
• TAKEAWAY: The potential Mitsui contract with Qatar has now been reported in two different media outlets. In
a recent interview with Bloomberg, a Mitsui energy executive avoided confirming the talks with Qatar, but it

looks like an agreement could be struck in the near future.



Japan-backed LNG expansion project in Indonesia boosts output 50%

(Nikkei Asia, Oct 20)
•  The expansion of the Tangguh LNG facility in Indonesia, which has several Japanese stakeholders,
has shipped its first cargo.
•  The new unit's launch was postponed from 2020, partly due to COVID-19.
•  Tangguh's annual production has now increased by 3.8 million tons to 11.4 million tons. Of this,
2.8 million tons will be sold to Indonesian power utility PLN, and up to 1 million tons to KEPCO. BP

operates the Tangguh facility, owning around 40%; six Japanese investors, including Mitsubishi
and Inpex, collectively hold about 46%.
•  CONTEXT: In 2022, Japan sourced around 10% of its LNG from Russia, but seeks to reduce this
dependency by supporting LNG projects with friendly nations.



BHP Mitsubishi Alliance sells Blackwater and Daunia mines in Australia

(Company statement, Oct 18)
•  BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) agreed to sell the Blackwater and Daunia mines to Whitehaven Coal
for about $4.1 billion, with a primary transaction of $3.2 billion and contingencies of up to $900
million over three years.
•  BMA is jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and global mining behemoth BHP, and focuses on
metallurgical coal ventures in Australia.
•  Whitehaven, an Australian coal producer, will take over the operations. This sale will be finalized in

FY2024.
•  CONTEXT: The Blackwater mine produces about 12 million tons a year, while Daunia produces
about 2.5 million tons a year. BMA will still keep its premium hard coking coal mines in Australia
such as Peak Downs and Saraji.
• TAKEAWAY: Among the reasons for the sale was the BMA's desire to focus on other projects involving heavy
coking coal and iron ore, copper and nickel. Whitehaven's decision is out of sync with a global market that is

increasingly moving away from coal. But events of the past 18 months have shown that when energy supplies
are tight, the market will gladly expand coal purchases to keep the lights on.

Japan's GX and Public Finance

Negotiations on Japan’s FY2024 budget are well underway, pitting the Ministry of
Finance bean counters against METI, the MoE and other ministries that seek to
maintain or increase their funding in the wake of the COVID splurge. Some of the key
budget items – and arguments – will revolve around decarbonization.

Japan needs to invest substantially in clean energy, but it also faces massive fiscal
challenges. How much of the proposed energy-related spending will eventually be
approved, and for which pathways, will determine where the country sits mid-way
through a decade during which it has vowed to slash emissions by as much as half.

A number of emergent industries, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture, see
this state funding as the catalyst they need to move from pilot projects to commercial
scale. For the established players in thermal and nuclear power, funds are vital for
revamping aging infrastructure and introducing new technologies. For those involved
in renewables, state support could help revive flagging momentum.

Japan’s FY2024 budget is almost certain to be the biggest yet. Even so, it will still
struggle to satisfy all parties. So, who are the likely winners?


The new gold rush
Virtually all Japan's central agencies seek a role in the new gold rush of the Green
Transformation (GX). On May 12, Japan’s Diet (parliament) formally adopted the GX
industrial policy as the key mechanism for promoting carbon neutrality. Much like the
roughly $400 billion American Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which accelerated
Japanese action, the GX initiative is technologically neutral on clean energy supply.
GX includes nuclear power in addition to the gamut of renewable energy sources,
efficiency, digitalization, and the emergent areas of hydrogen, ammonia, carbon
recycling and other avenues of decarbonization.

But unlike the IRA, two-thirds of whose climate and energy provisions are financed by
tax credits, Japan’s GX proposes a big dollop of direct public finance – cumulatively
as much as ¥20 trillion over the next decade. This spending is to prime the pump of
private-sector investment and achieve a combined public-private total of ¥150 trillion
of GX investment by the mid-2030s.

Policymakers plan to have most of Japan’s GX public-sector spending backed by GX
transition bonds, paid down with revenues from pricing carbon. While adopting these
carbon pricing and related mechanisms is not slated to start until 2026, the first
issuance of Japan’s GX transition bonds is imminent.

To be sure, some environmental analysts fret that GX transition bonds may not be
ready for ESG prime time. But these presumed issues are perhaps overstated given,

20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

for example, the $200 billion (2022 data) scale and diversity of the Asian green, social,
sustainable, and sustainability-linked bond market.


Budget process and details
In any event, late August saw the various ministries publish their fiscal requests for the
2024 budget, submissions that are now being debated with the MoF. The normal
budget cycle sees the MoF then compile a draft budget for the Cabinet in December,
followed by the Cabinet’s submission of the budget for debate in the Diet. Its
approval is generally secured in March, and the budget implemented with the April 1
start of the fiscal year.

The August spending requests for GX are part of a massive ¥114 trillion in the total
2024 initial budget request. The overall GX component is generally assessed at about
¥2 trillion, a sum that seems likely to survive MoF scrutiny given the imperative of GX
for the government’s foreign and economic policy.

Among the major components proposed for the 2024 budget:

•  ¥52.3 billion for research on next-generation nuclear power (and ¥152.1
billion over 2024-2026)
•  ¥40.7 billion for fostering GX start-up initiatives (and ¥203.4 billion over 2024-

2028)
•  ¥720.7 billion for advanced solar, hydrogen catalyzers, batteries, wind, power
microprocessors (and ¥1.2 trillion over 2024-2028)
•  ¥91 billion for helping SMEs transition from fossil fuels and adopt cutting-
edge efficiency (and ¥192.5 billion over 2024-2028)
•  ¥148.4 billion for heat pumps, insulation and other building efficiency
•  ¥141.7 billion for diffusing EVs, hybrids, and fuel-cell vehicles in addition to
charging stations

As we can see, ¥1.2 trillion is slated for FY2024, with the balance spread over periods
of three to five years. The ¥720.7 billion ear-marked for solar, wind, and other
renewables may look significant, but caution seems in order: the eye-watering costs of
subsidizing power microprocessor projects could readily consume most of that
money.

GX funding yet to be determined includes measures to help hard-to-decarbonize
sectors reduce emissions, recycling initiatives, hydrogen, ammonia, sustainable
aviation fuels, and other project areas. Hydrogen in particular appears to be an area
to watch, as investors are eagerly anticipating the signaling effect of public sector GX
investment.

At present, the government, which seeks the best return on investment, is preparing
to convene an expert committee to deliberate on how to fine-tune the dispersal of the
10-year, ¥20 trillion in GX public finance. It will be instructive to examine how many of
these experts share METI’s broad-portfolio decarbonization view of the world.

Levels of scrutiny
The current ministerial proposals for GX spending not only have to make it through
the scrutiny of MoF assessments. A host of academics and environmental activist
organizations are already deriding most of the non-renewable energy items as
wasteful and likely to prolong Japan’s reliance on fossil fuels.

They argue that the bulk of spending should be devoted to energy from solar and
wind, to maximize GHG reductions and help Japanese firms compete in an evolving
world of green premiums and carbon border adjustments.

But these critics of spending on next-generation nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia, carbon-
capture and other innovation overlook several discomfiting realities. For one thing,
Japan increasingly confronts political and other constraints on its capacity to further
expand its sizable solar domestic deployment, let alone ramp up wind, hydro,
geothermal and other conventional renewables.

Moreover, Japan is hobbled by the high cost of conventional renewable energy in the
context of serious fiscal constraints. These include the incredible scale of Japan’s
public debt plus the burgeoning burdens from social security, national defense, and
the risk of higher interest payments.

As we see in figure 1, Japan’s government debt of about ¥1270 trillion represents a
debt/ GDP ratio of about 250%, well more than double even Italy. Three decades
ago, Japan was a paragon of fiscal probity. But after Japan’s 1980s bubble economy
collapsed, the state stepped in to goose private-sector investment via public works
and tax cuts.

That profligate approach was recognized as a failure in the early 2000s. Even so, the
continuing expansion of the debt suggests that the tax increases and spending cuts
required to regain fiscal discipline are politically difficult.

COVID and other crises intervened to blow away carefully constructed pathways to
fiscal rectitude. Hence, 2023 saw the government’s debt finance exceed ¥35.6 trillion,
accounting for 31.1% of revenues.

Moreover, Japan has to confront the double whammy of more costly social and
national security. Social security spending for FY2023 is just under ¥37 trillion (32.3%
of the national budget), rising at increments of about ¥500 billion per year. And
national defense spending is to be doubled from the traditional 1% of GDP (roughly
¥5 trillion), through a cumulative ¥43 trillion hike over the five years from FY2023 to
FY2027. Defense spending in FY2023 has already increased 26.3% from FY2022, to
¥6.83 trillion.


Spreading bets wisely?
In light of the above realities, Japan’s emphasis on a great diversity of GX projects
perhaps makes sense. Japanese policymakers evidently seek to spread their GX bets
across several decarbonization pathways. This approach may be more prudent than
gambling that Japan can not only cut the high cost of domestic renewable energy,
but also use renewables to supply both a major portion of electricity demand in
addition to fueling industrial and other processes.

It is also clear that Japanese authorities want to foster GX approaches that dovetail
with the needs of their Asian counterparts, seeing CCUS as one common focus area.


Japan’s desire to maximize returns from what it can invest seems understandable. The
main reason Japan’s fiscal regime hasn’t collapsed is – as we see in figure 2 - that the
BoJ holds an astounding 53.3% of Japanese government bonds versus the mere 7.2%
held by foreigners. Among G7 countries, only Italy’s credit rating is worse than
Japan’s, whose capacity to stick to ultra-low interest rates relies on a small foreign
presence in the inner sanctum of the bond markets.

In any other country, pressure from bond investors would have driven up rates and
caused debt repayment (service on the national debt) to rise well beyond the fiscal
2023 budget’s ¥25.3 trillion (22.1% of the budget). And over the past few years, the
role of foreign interests in JGB trading and other functions has increased, gradually
adding pressure on the fiscal system.

Of course, the GX spending is supposed to be financed – in the future – by levies on
hydrocarbon fuels and other mechanisms for pricing carbon. But these initiatives are
only nascent. It remains unclear whether they will become a credible and consistent
source of revenues for GX bond repayment or whether the GX debt will simply be
added to the gargantuan pile to be paid down through some combination of inflation
and tax increases.

Hence in the present, Japan’s multiple avenues for investment GX disbursements
probably make sense as a means of diversifying risks and maximizing opportunities in
a precarious political economy.

Modernizing Japan’s Grid: Sharing Power Data as the First Step

For the energy transition to succeed in Japan, the national grid will have to undergo
significant reforms and modernization in order to increase efficiency, enhance energy
security and reduce environmental impact. Now, the nation’s main power transmission
firms have taken a first step in that direction.


A new entity has emerged to act as a central repository for all electricity transmission
and distribution data in Japan. As well as opening the door to new business
opportunities, it will help to ensure that the nation’s regions are better-connected
through a reliable and secure transmission network. The consolidation of data should
also boost resilience.

More than any other of its G7 allies, Japan is prone to natural disasters, such as
earthquakes and typhoons, which can disrupt power supply. A reformed grid can
incorporate advanced technologies to enhance flexibility of power delivery thus
minimizing downtime during disasters. Also, it will enable consumers to have more
control over their energy usage through smart grids.

While these issues are by no means unique to Japan, the country faces a number of
exceptional challenges, the most prominent being the fact that its power transmission
system is bifurcated, each half runs at a different frequency. For the country to
embrace and support an increased reliance on variable renewable energy, distributed
systems, batteries and EVs, among other features, it needs to create a next-
generation grid that speaks the same language. It is hoped the central data entity will
enable just that.


Background history on power industry liberalization
From 1939 to 1951, the country’s utilities were integrated into a single unit known as
Japan Power Generation and Transmission. The U.S. occupational government broke
it into nine EPCOs, (later on, 10, when Okinawa Electric was added), which
subsequently dominated all aspects of the country’s power supply for more than 60
years.

Led by Tokyo Electric (TEPCO), Kansai Electric and Chubu Electric, the EPCOs
developed individual power technologies cooperating with the likes of Toshiba,
Hitachi, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Electric, Fuji Electric or Meidensha.
EPCO engineers competed amongst each other to develop somewhat different and
better technologies.

While TEPCO preferentially ordered power equipment from Toshiba and Hitachi,
Kansai Electric cooperated with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Electric.
Therefore, the equipment development between suppliers was an extension of the
bitter rivalry between TEPCO and Kansai – to have the most effective and efficient
power capacity.

| --- |
| Kansai Electric cooperated with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Electric. |
| Therefore, the equipment development between suppliers was an extension of the |
| bitter rivalry between TEPCO and Kansai – to have the most effective and efficient |
| power capacity. |

This competition helped suppliers to develop highly advanced equipment, which, due
to its quality, eventually became in demand across the globe. However, these
achievements became a negative for Japan’s power system once the power industry
was deregulated, the EPCOs unbundled, and the market opened to new players.

In March 2000, the power market began to be liberalized with retail sales of extra high
voltage contracts. Additional deregulation came in April 2004 and then in April 2005
for high voltage contracts. In April 2016, the full liberalization of power retailing
began, which culminated in April 2020 when the transmission and distribution (T&D)
business of each EPCO was officially broken off from the electricity generation entities
in order to secure the neutrality of the grid.

While the generation and retail sectors saw a massive inflow of new players ready to
add competition, the market approach could not be replicated in the T&D space. For
new entrants to succeed there, they’d need to build an entirely new set of power
lines, substations, etc. and the huge investment is unlikely to pay off.

What’s more, a centralized national power grid is more effective to operate than a
fragmented one. Therefore, while METI pushed for greater competition in power
production and retail, the ministry has gone the other way in the T&D space, seeking
to unify the infrastructure and operations across the regions (apart from Okinawa).


Grid consolidation needed to form the All-Japan Power Transmission System
By the end of the 2020s, METI wants to integrate the power grid control system
functions of all transmission companies, excluding Okinawa Electric. As a prerequisite
for this, all the regional T&D companies are required to unify their power grid control
systems. Reliable, real-time data will be key.

For the first step in implementing the consolidation, on August 31, the nine major
regional T&D companies jointly established a new entity to integrate the
specifications of all grid control systems. This will allow the sharing of data collected
from smart meters, including personal data such as power consumption, and
anonymous metadata about consumers in each region.


This new company, Transmission and Distribution IT & OT Systems, will play a key role
in unifying the power grid control systems. Its Electricity Data Aggregation System
utilizes info from smart meters installed in homes, businesses, etc., while ensuring
privacy and security. Also, the next-generation intermediate distribution system will
allow all transmission firms in each area (excluding Okinawa) to share the central
dispatch system that they’ve developed individually.

Last month, TEPCO became the first Japanese company to supply the new entity with
monthly and daily data. The other companies will start to do so within FY2024. Real
time data will be collected after the first half of 2025.

The operation of the new entity will be led by the Transmission & Distribution Grid
Council (TDGC), which is made up of members from the nine major T&D companies.

Market impact
By unifying all of the nation’s balancing systems, each regional power system can
secure higher power system resilience, as well as procure the cheapest balance power
from a much wider area, compared with the current system in operation.

The integrated power grid system can also forecast the balancing power needed at
times when excessive volumes of renewable energy are generated and there’s a need
for curtailment; or when the local power grid is overloaded.

Moreover, the new national system will strengthen grid resilience by “duplicating” the
power system; that means, it will build and operate two circuits in case an accident
knocks one of them offline for some reason. This will reduce the risk of a ‘perfect
storm’ type of situation where multiple disasters and setbacks hit simultaneously and
there’s the threat of a blackout.

On the business side, the value of pooling real-time power usage data in one place
could be immense. As of October 2023, the government has dropped restrictions on
the use of data by non-electricity companies, and according to Nikkei, over 20
companies including Daiwa House Industry and Toshiba are already eager to
introduce services based on this data.

Some Japanese startups see the data as a gateway to installing more residential
rooftop solar and battery units and persuading people to buy energy management
systems, which promise to improve energy efficiency and cut their power bills.


While certain fees and user permissions may be required, access to nationwide
electricity usage data – rather than data sets that only cover a particular region – will
create valuable business opportunities. In terms of smart meters alone, Japan has
more installed (80 million units) than the U.S. or European countries.

Some of the proposed services could potentially even save lives. Chubu Electric and
trading house Mitsubishi are said to be considering a real-time power monitoring
service that would aim to detect abnormalities in the routines of the elderly living
alone. In a country facing a demographic crisis, that’s an energy-data business that
could earn even more than the sale of electricity.

GLOBAL      VIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI


Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the
Japan NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We
see the following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ LNG
Chevron Australia and workers at its two LNG plants reached an agreement, ending
an impasse that led to threaten renewed strikes. The Gorgon and Wheatstone
projects in Western Australia supply around 6% of the world's LNG.

CRMs
Prices for key EV battery materials have fallen sharply this year – lithium is down
almost 70%; nickel down 40%; and cobalt faces a glut with prices almost at record
lows. Much of the decline is due to slower growth for EV demand in China.

EU/ Electricity market
Germany agreed to allow France to use state subsidies for nuclear power plants, and
thus unblock a long-stalled reform of the EU electricity market. Germany has worried
that French subsidies for nuclear plants would give French industry an advantage with
lower energy prices.

India/ Coal power
Coal inventories at power plants in the first half of October fell 12.6%, with electricity
demand boosting imports as fuel use outpaced supply. Very dry weather and a rise in
economic activity has boosted consumption; but there’s also been a seasonal decline
in generation from renewable sources such as wind and solar.

Netherlands/ CCS
Construction of Europe's largest carbon capture and storage facility begins in the
Rotterdam port area. The €1.3 billion "Porthos" project will be operational by 2026.
CO2 emitted by refineries and chemical plants will be transported to empty gas fields
under the North Sea, 20 km off the Dutch coast.

Qatar and Netherlands/LNG
Shell will buy up to 3.5 mtpa of LNG from Qatar for the Netherlands, as per two 27-
year purchase agreements. Starting in 2026, QatarEnergy will supply LNG sourced
from its North Field East and North Field South projects. Shell has stakes in both.

Scotland/Offshore wind
The govt will invest up to £500 million in the next five years in the offshore wind
supply chain. The funding would act as a catalyst for private investment in Scottish
ports and harbors, encouraging domestic companies to seek opportunities.

South Africa/Energy transition
The country plans to raise $60 billion over the next five years to switch to green
energy. South Africa will set the terms and time frame of its energy transition, said
deputy president Paul Mashatile, adding that “We recognize the need to reduce
carbon emissions, but we’re also committed to economic development.”

| almost 70%; nickel down 40%; and cobalt faces a glut with prices almost at record |
| lows. Much of the decline is due to slower growth for EV demand in China. |

| EU/ Electricity market |
| --- |
| Germany agreed to allow France to use state subsidies for nuclear power plants, and |
| thus unblock a long-stalled reform of the EU electricity market. Germany has worried |
| that French subsidies for nuclear plants would give French industry an advantage with |
| lower energy prices. |

Uganda/Oil pipeline
A $4 billion crude oil pipeline to link Uganda and Tanzania has settled a disagreement
with Chinese investors. The 1,443 km pipeline should start in 2025, with a capacity of
246,000 barrels daily at peak. TotalEnergies has a 62% stake. Tanzania Petroleum
Development Corp and Uganda National Oil each have a 15% interest, while the rest
is owned by CNOOC.

U.S./Oil
Fundraising across equity markets rose this year, particularly among independent oil
exploration and production groups and oilfield services companies. Senior bankers
said they expect this trend to persist as the oil price will remain high.

Venezuela/Oil exports
In an effort to ease global oil prices, the U.S. issued a six-month license authorizing
sales in Venezuela's energy sector after a deal was reached between the govt and the
political opposition regarding the 2024 elections.
