Japan’s top three banks to stop financing thermal coal mining
(Nikkei Asia, April 1)
•  Japan's three largest banks will stop financing coal excavation for power generation.
•  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said they no longer will
provide funding for new thermal coal mining projects. Mizuho Financial Group made a similar
policy change last year.
•  In Sumitomo’s case, this will extend to coal transport infrastructure.

•  The three banks are estimated to have billions of dollars in outstanding loans for thermal coal
mining.


New panel to write advanced nuclear reactor development roadmaps
(Japan NRG, March 28)
•  METI plans to launch a new working group comprised of nuclear experts to design road maps to
develop advanced nuclear reactors. The panel will be headed by Kyoto University Professor
Kurosaki Ken.
•  METI sees advanced nuclear reactors as technologies that go beyond power supplies, and which

also have the means to produce zero emission hydrogen, and to complement variable renewables.
Among the 73 types of small modular reactors in development globally, Japan is focused on high-
temperature engineering of fast reactors that use recycled nuclear fuel.
• TAKEAWAY: Most small modular reactor projects outside Russia and China are driven by equipment vendors,
while power operators are cautious on cost.

• In addition to building realistic cost scenarios, the METI working group is tasked to answer questions that
range from identifying the sites of the new reactors, creating new regulatory framework for safety inspection of
new technologies, and ensuring the safety of nuclear plants that are operating.

• See the Electricity Markets section for results of a recent public opinion survey that favors the restart of existing
nuclear reactors.


Top oil major gives estimate for Japan hydrogen supply chain capex
(Japan NRG, March 29)
•  Oil refiner ENEOS met with the government to explain the outlook for building out the hydrogen

supply chain to deliver both green and blue versions of the fuel to Japan.
•  The company told the government’s ammonia and hydrogen subcommittee that capital
expenditure for building a 40,000 ton/ year hydrogen supply chain overseas is ¥130 billion, while a
300,000-ton/ year facility will cost ¥440 billion.
•  The government expects Japan will consume 2 to 3 million tons of hydrogen in 2030, and based
on ENEOS’ model ¥1-1.5 trillion capital expenditure is required.
•  Spending needs to increase 1-fold until 2040.

•  As the investment is massive, suppliers are wary if there’ll be enough demand and returns for the
investment, ENEOS told the subcommittee.
• TAKEAWAY: ENEOS and JERA are two of the top energy firms to have discussed the cost of hydrogen supply

chain investments. Given the investment amounts estimates, there is now growing interest in re-opening the
debate around building more green hydrogen production capacities in Japan, which would also allay energy
security concerns.



Japanese households emit 5.9% more carbon in 2020: MoE
(Japan NRG, March 29)
•  The average Japanese household emitted 2.88 tons of carbon in 2020, up 5.9% from the previous
year. When broken down — 1.88 tons were from electricity consumption, 0.44 tons from city

gases, 0.17 tons from LP gases, and 0.39 tons from kerosene.
•  The regional breakdown showed Hokkaido households topped at 4.65 tons, due to high
consumption of kerosene and electricity for heating. Senior households aged over 65 emit 3.02
tons, while those below 29 only 1.59 tons.

Japan’s used cooking oil export price soars on clean oil demand in Asia
(Japan NRG, March 30)
•  Food supplies for animals in Japan are diminishing as used cooking oil, one of the key ingredients
of animal nutrition products, is exported in larger volumes on strong demand for low emission oil.
•  Japan’s export price surged to ¥140/ kl, to the level of local diesel oil retail prices that are at multi-

year highs. The cooking oil is usually exported at ¥75-85/ kg.
•  Used cooking oil export volume has also swelled. The 2021 exports totaled 109,374 tons, up from
75,675 tons in 2018. The February export volume was 7,602 tons.
•  Used cooking oil is used as clean fuel in Asian countries. Singapore is the top buyer, followed by
South Korea and Malaysia.
• TAKEAWAY: Higher grain and corn prices propelled by the Ukraine conflict, as well as soaring crude oil that

triggered the rise in palm oil prices, are causing clashes between energy and food players in some markets.
The junior partner in the ruling coalition, the Komeito Party, has pressed PM Kishida for more decisive
measures to strengthen Japan’s food supply chain.



First carbon credit issued for Japan-Bangladeshi joint crediting mechanism project
(Japan NRG, March 31)
•  251 tons of compliance credits were issued to Japan, and 238 tons to Bangladesh for improving

energy efficiency at a plant and installing solar/diesel hybrid power generation system at a fastener
factory.


Japan to boost EV subsidies marginally to encourage transition

(Kyodo, March 25)
•  METI will raise the maximum subsidy to EV car buyers to ¥850,000, an increase of ¥50,000 on the
¥800,000 announced in November’s supplemental budget.
•  METI says the boost was prompted by high energy prices and will encourage drivers to transition
away from fossil fuels.
•  The maximum subsidy payable to buyers of plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles will increase by
the same amount, to ¥550,000 and ¥2.55 million, respectively.



Seven-party consortium plans hydrogen hub for Kawasaki waterfront
(Company Statement, March 30)
•  A consortium comprising Asahi Kasei, Ajinomoto, ENEOS, JR East, Showa Denko, Toshiba Energy

Systems plans to make Kawasaki a hydrogen hub.
•  The consortium will build new pipelines as well as utilize existing pipelines and other infrastructure
to provide hydrogen services to a wide range of industries in the area, including factories and
power plants.
•  The consortium wants to avoid a “Catch-22” situation where demand never increases due to a lack
of supply and vice versa.

Local governments foster private/public groups to promote decarbonization
(Nikkei, March 29)
o  A number of cities around Japan are building public-private consortiums to promote
decarbonization, including the rollout of a hydrogen economy. The oldest example of
such a scheme is in Fukuoka, western Japan.

o  The Fukuoka Strategy Conference for Hydrogen Energy was established in 2004, making
it one of Japan’s longest-running alternative energy groups. It has over 700 businesses
affiliated with it, as well as local bodies and academics.
o  In the latest move in promoting hydrogen, the Fukuoka government will create a liaison
office to handle inquiries from manufacturers interested in producing hydrogen-related
systems or fuel cells.
o  Similar initiatives are also underway in Yokohama and Tottori. The Tokyo Metropolitan

Government is establishing an innovation fund for private/public partnerships expected
to be worth over ¥12 billion.


Panasonic sets aside almost $5 billion for shift to batteries and hydrogen

(Asia Nikkei, April 1)
•  Panasonic will invest ¥600 billion ($4.9 billion) in the next three years in automotive batteries,
hydrogen energy and software.
•  Growth areas such as automotive batteries, supply chain software and air-conditioning, would get
two-thirds of the capital while the rest will go into new technologies like hydrogen energy and
workplace digitization.



INPEX to join nuclear fusion race with startup investments

(Nikkei Asia, April 1)
•  INPEX aims to invest in several startups in Japan that will allow the oil and gas company to move
into the emerging technology of nuclear fusion as early as this year. Investments include into Kyoto
Fusioneering in Kyoto, EX-Fusion in Osaka, and Helical Fusion in Tokyo. INPEX is also in talks with
overseas startups.
•  These would mark the first investments by a major Japanese company in a nuclear fusion

developer. Inpex plans to invest several hundred millions of yen in each company and gradually
raise the amount of funds up to tens of billions of yen.
•  Japan’s government aims to commercialize nuclear fusion generation in the 2040s and Inpex
shares this target.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
INPEX, ANZ and Qantas to work on carbon farming and biofuels project in Australia
(Company Statement, March 31)

o  INPEX, ANZ and Qantas have entered an MoU to progress the evaluation of a project
which brings together carbon farming and renewable biofuels in the Wheatbelt region of
Western Australia.
o  The project provides an opportunity to support reforestation and decarbonization using
drought-resilient native tree crops, integrated with existing farming systems.

o  The parties will undertake a more detailed feasibility study into the harvesting and
processing of native biomass crops and selected agricultural waste residues, to produce
low-carbon renewable biofuels. Under the MoU, the first planting of native trees is
expected to take place in the winter of 2023.



Kansai Electric unveils plans to halve CO2 emissions from power generation by 2025
(Kankyo Business, March 30)
•  Kansai Electric unveiled a “Zero Carbon Road Map", which calls for halving CO2 emissions from
power generation by fiscal 2025, compared with FY2013 levels. That would mean a drop of 25

million tons of CO2 or more.
•  The power utility plans to achieve this without reducing power output.
•  The target includes a goal for making renewable energy one of its core sources of power. With a
¥1 trillion investment plan for the Japan market, the utility plans to grow its domestic renewables
portfolio to 5 GW by 2040. Globally, the renewables assets would amount to 9 GW by then.
•  Other ways to reduce emissions envision efficiencies, nuclear restarts, and an eventual move into

hydrogen.


Nuclear power’s hidden carbon intensity: Opinion
(Asahi Ronza, March 28)
•  CONTEXT: This opinion piece is by Ryukoku University lecturer Oshima Ken’ichi in a magazine
published by Asahi Shimbun, one of the top national dailies.
•  In February, the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, a “green” classification system, officially
categorized nuclear energy as “sustainable”. However, according to the IEA, only 3% of the $359

billion invested in energy in 2020 went to the nuclear sector.
•  The situation in Japan is no different, with less than 5% of total electricity needs supplied by
nuclear power stations in 2020. Nuclear plants are no longer a major source of electricity, or even a
source of baseload electricity.
•  Such concerns about the future of Japan’s nuclear power industry have encouraged pundits to
paint nuclear as a green source of energy.
•  However, nuclear plants are dependent on external electricity supplies for safety, and the mining,

refining, processing and transport of uranium, as well as the construction and decommissioning of
power plants, are all carbon intensive.
•  While the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry puts the life-cycle carbon footprint
associated with nuclear power generation at a mere 19 g/ kWh, a Stanford University analysis
introduces the concept of “opportunity cost emissions” for the long time taken to construct
nuclear plants compared with renewable energy plants, and estimates total carbon emissions

associated with each kWh generated by a nuclear plant at over 100 g. This is 30 times higher than
for offshore wind.

Majority of Japanese now want nuclear plants restarted
(Nikkei, March 28)
•  A survey by Nikkei Shimbun found that 53% of respondents think idle nuclear plants that passed
safety checks should be restarted. This is up from 44% in September.
•  38% of respondents were opposed to restarting nuclear plants, down from 46%.
•  When asked about “nuclear sharing” — an arrangement under which U.S. nuclear weapons would
be stationed in Japan and the government consulted on their use — 23% of respondents

supported establishing such an arrangement with the U.S., while 17% did not. A further 56% were
opposed to nuclear sharing but supported the matter being discussed.
• TAKEAWAY: This is possibly the first media survey in Japan to show the majority of the respondents being
supporting of nuclear restarts since the Fukushima accident in March 2011. The numbers also tally closely with
a poll conducted in March by the left-leaning (and largely anti-nuclear) Asahi Shimbun, which showed 48% of
the respondents behind restarts. Should the mood continue, PM Kishida will feel safer about discussing pro-

nuclear initiatives including government backing for new reactor designs. Still, given how long the public has
been anti-nuclear and how much depends on matters outside the control of the national government, we do
not expect the restart process to accelerate suddenly.



High costs drive Lpio and West Holdings out of electricity retail market
(Smart Japan, March 28)
•  Electricity retailer Lpio is discontinuing all retail electricity services.
•  Lpio said high wholesale energy prices made its operations unsustainable.
•  Founded as a supplier of LPG in 1965, Lpio launched its electricity retail business in 2016. In

November, Lpio supplied 37 GWh to an estimated 140,000 subscribers.
•  West Holdings also announced its withdrawal from power retail as prices soar due to high fossil
fuel costs and tight domestic supply.
• TAKEAWAY: Lpio and West join Hope Energy in exiting power retail in recent weeks. Other companies have
also been named in the media as taking similar steps. There remain more than 700 power retailers in Japan
and clearly the majority do not have the resources to become serious players in the now changed electricity

market, in which there is greater volatility and prices are rising. It would probably benefit Japan to have the
number of retailers shrink, but unless the process is smoothly managed it will cause disruptions for households
and businesses. Were that to occur on a noticeable scale in the near future, expect the government to quickly
bring out tougher regulations on power retail.

Shipper Mitsui O.S.K. looks for entry points into offshore wind
(Dempa Publications, March 29)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), a major shipping company, has begun full-fledged efforts to move into
the business of offshore wind power generation.
•  Earlier in March, the company announced its participation in an offshore wind farm jointly with a

major energy company, and also established a fund to invest in related businesses in Japan. MOL
is the first major Japanese shipping company to move into offshore wind power generation.
•  The company has also begun discussions with a construction company with a track record in
offshore construction to see how it can use its ships in this business area.
•  MOL, together with Toho Gas and Hokuriku Electric, are due to participate in Formosa 1, the first
commercial-scale offshore wind farm in Taiwan.



Kansai Electric looks at 676.3 MW offshore wind project in Saga prefecture

(Denki Shimbun, March 31)
•  Kansai Electric has begun studying the development of a landing-type offshore wind farm off the
coast of Karatsu City, Saga Prefecture.
•  The company submitted the first stage of the environmental assessment to METI and the head of
the local government.
•  The facility is expected to have a maximum capacity of 676.2 MW, which would be one of Japan’s
biggest. The output of a single turbine will range from 9,500 to 14,700 kilowatts.



Chubu Electric invests in Indian energy company targeting off-grid consumers
(Nikkei, March 28)
•  Chubu Electric plans to purchase a 20% stake of Indian-based OMC Power in a deal believed to be
worth several billion yen.
•  Founded by Telecommunications mogul Rohit Chandra in 2011, OMC operates around 200 small

power stations and offers mini-grid services to rural consumers.

All of Japan’s major power and gas companies due to raise rates in May
(Yomiuri Shimbun, March 31)
•  All 10 major electric power companies and the four major city gas companies announced increased

rates for May citing rising LNG and coal prices due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
•  The largest increase among the electric utilities was announced by TEPCO. The rates are now up
by more than ¥1,600 in the last year to ¥8,505 (including consumption tax) for the average
household. Prices are at their highest in five years, the period for which comparable data is
available.
•  May will be the ninth consecutive month that all major gas companies will raise their prices.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Electricity and gas rates are subject to a national system that automatically reflects
fluctuations in the prices of fuels and raw materials in rates. In order to reduce the burden on
consumers, there is a cap on the amount that can be passed on, and five power companies,
including Kansai Electric and Shikoku Electric have already reached it.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Chubu Electric downgrades earnings guidance again amid high fossil fuel prices
(Asahi Shimbun, March 25)
o  Chubu Electric revised investor earnings guidance for the fourth time.

o  Chubu projected a ¥45 billion loss in the fiscal year to March, but revised its projected
loss to ¥50 billion in response to high wholesale energy prices.


TEPCO begins move of nuclear power unit to Kashiwazaki city

(Denki Shimbun, March 31)
•  Tokyo Electric (TEPCO) Holdings has begun relocating its nuclear power business headquarters to
Kashiwazaki City, Niigata Prefecture, which will eventually see 300 staff moved there.
•  Approximately 70 people involved in quality, safety, and facility diagnostics will be assigned to the
new office in April.
•  The company plans to split the roles of chief of its Nuclear Energy & Safety division and director of

its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP to create a structure that allows the company to focus on the power
plant. A former Chubu Electric employee will be appointed as an assistant director.
• TAKEAWAY: Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP is TEPCO’s only operable nuclear power plant and this is a step towards
building better local relations to allow for its restart at some point in the future. At the earliest, it would be 2H
2022.

WAR IN UKRAINE:
METI announces policies to move away from Russian gas, oil, palladium
(Japan NRG, March 31)
•  METI will be more active in securing oil, coal, LNG, palladium, ferrosilicon, low-carbon ferrochrome

and gases for semiconductor manufacturing. It will:
o  Ask non-Russian producers to increase output, starting with Kuwait on March 31. Japan is
providing financial support to Kuwait.
o  Collaborate with other oil consuming nations
o  Directly engage with the private sector’s LNG procurement activities
o  Monitor local LNG and coal stocks
o  Decrease consumption of coal, palladium and other resources and find substitutes

o  Support upstream projects through JOGMEC
o  Deploy mega solar-storage battery systems, cut the number of gasoline cars on the road
o  Push ambitious energy conservation/transition programs
o  Newly-established Strategic Material and Energy Supply Chain will coordinate the
actions.
• TAKEAWAY: Japanese companies purchase raw materials on long-term contracts, often paying premiums over

spot prices. This has worked out in their favor so far and may further help when negotiating new deals amid
tight market conditions. As in the Kuwaiti case, supply guarantees may be packaged with financial aid and
hydrogen/ammonia technology transfers.
• There is also a risk, however, that a mentality to hoard supplies will see the government protecting too many

raw materials, even those that are less critical or for which there are ready alternatives. Example: It is
questionable if the ferrosilicon supply chain requires government support. Japanese steelmakers increased
purchases from Russian Ferro Alloys and Mechel over the last two years for economic reasons, not because
Russian companies were the only suppliers on the market. There are plenty of substitutes. On the other hand,
Russia does have strong market power over low-carbon ferrochrome, used for specialty steel, and palladium.



Japan joins G7 in rejecting Russia’s demand to pay in rubles

(Japan NRG, March 29)
•  METI Minister Hagiuda told the G7 that Japan won’t accept the Russian government unilaterally
changing contract terms between private companies. Such behavior discourages stability of deals
between companies, he said.

Hagiuda says Japan will not pull out of Arctic LNG
(Jiji, Japan NRG, Apr 1)
•  Underlining the importance placed by the government on energy security, METI minister Hagiuda
said Japan won’t pull out of the Arctic LNG 2 project.
•  “We have secured long-term claimants," and "in the current situation of sudden energy price

increases, we can procure energy at prices cheaper than the market price. This is extremely
important for energy security," Hagiuda said.
•  JOGMEC and Mitsui & Co. are the Japanese corporations that hold interests in the project, which
operates within the Arctic circle. Japanese banks had previously committed funding to the project.
•  The EU passed legislation banning additional European participation in Arctic LNG 2.
• TAKEAWAY: In the last week, both PM Kishida and METI minister Hagiuda have said for the first time in a clear

fashion that Japan will not exist Russian oil and gas interests. Without U.S. pressure for Japan to exit, the
government is able to stick to its position that letting go of the rights Japanese firms hold in Russia will not
help contain the war in Ukraine but will benefit either Russia or China. For now, it looks like the operating
projects in Russia’s Sakhalin will continue to send their products to Japan, but new developments like Arctic
LNG 2 will be frozen. At some point, that position too will become untenable. President Putin may well decide
to push forward with Arctic LNG 2 regardless and label those partners that obstruct the process (or conversely

do not help with financing and engineering know-how) to be “unfriendly”. When that point comes, Japan will
need to act. But for now, the onus on Japanese energy buyers will be to search for alternative sources and
prepare for a Plan B.



METI will not ban export of strategically critical energy and metal supplies
(Japan NRG, April 1)
•  METI’s Strategic Material and Energy Supply Chain headquarters confirmed that there won’t be
export bans on strategically critical oil and metal products.
•  Japan exported 2.4 million kl of refined oil products in February, up 42% from a year ago.

Ruling coalition’s junior partner calls for reinstatement of gasoline ‘trigger clause’
(NHK, Mar 28)
•  Representatives of the LDP’s coalition partner, the New Komeito, called on PM Kishida to reinstate
the ‘trigger clause’ (a gasoline tax relief scheme), and include additional funding for gasoline

subsidies in the upcoming supplemental budget.
•  Komeito Diet members hope to debate the matter with the LDP in April.
•  If the trigger clause is activated, tax breaks will cause prices at the pump to fall by ¥25/ liter
whenever the average retail price for gasoline exceeds ¥160/ liter.
• TAKEAWAY: See the Analysis section for a deep dive on this issue.

Limited Options Tie Japanese Government’s Hands
Dealing with Looming Oil Shock

Soaring LNG and crude oil prices, accelerated by Russia's war with Ukraine, are
starting to reverberate throughout the economy, inflicting a high toll on Japanese
households and nearly all areas of commerce and industry. Some experts already refer
to this situation as the Third Oil Shock, with the first such global energy shock having
taken place in 1973, almost half a century ago.

So far, state subsidies have been the main measure to combat energy-driven inflation.
Last week Prime Minister Kishida ordered yet more of the same in an effort to shield
consumers and seniors, in particular, from higher food bills. But it’s increasingly clear
that this won’t be enough and bolder steps will be needed in the coming months,
likely tying up more of the national budget, weakening the yen, and likely delaying
the energy transition.

Unlike the 1970s, Japan’s government, as well as those of its western allies, are more
experienced and in a better position to tackle the negative fallout from rapidly rising
energy prices. However, many of the tools available to the state and the monetary
authorities in Japan are already deployed or even tapped out after three years of
dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic as well as long-term structural issues.

With only three months or so before upper house election the premier will be walking
a political and economic tightrope. Deft handling of the energy dilemma could help
Kishida’s administration secure a strong political platform for years. How much control
the government can exercise over energy markets will be severally tested in the next
three to four months.


It all starts with a full tank
Nationwide, retail gasoline prices have risen to a 13-year high. Without existing
countermeasures, the price would have surpassed the record high of ¥185/ liter
reached in 2008. Some experts even foresee the price going beyond ¥200.

If crude oil prices remain at an average of ¥120/ barrel, the burden on households will
grow by about ¥44,000 this year and the same next year, according to estimates.
Inevitably, this would lead directly to a painful dip in disposable income. Additionally,
the cost for kerosene purchases in cold weather regions will be of particular concern
from about October this year.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February indicates that gasoline, as well as
electricity, and gas prices rose 22.2%, 19.7%, and 22.9%, respectively, the steepest
YoY increase for energy in 41 years.

Soaring fuel costs are putting pressure on agriculture and fisheries, which use heavy
oil for fuel, and the transportation and cleaning industries are also said to be hit hard.

Power utilities are having a rough time, in part due to the fact that it takes three to five
months to pass on rising fuel costs to electricity bills. To make matters worse, in order

17


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

to protect consumers there’s a system in place that prevents an upward adjustment if
the average fuel price exceeds 1.5 times over a certain base price. Indeed, Hokuriku
Electric faced this upper limit for February, and four more utilities are heading for the
same for March.

Already in the 3Q of 2021, all of the major power companies, except for Kyushu
Electric, saw a YoY decline of 30-80% in income, pushing four of the 10 into the red.
Six of the companies, including TEPCO and Chubu Electric, are expected to post
losses for the fiscal year that ended in March.


Subsidies vs tax cuts
PM Kishida, who appears to favor the pork-barrel approach, last week instructed
government to start work on a new stimulus package, rumored to be as large as ¥2
trillion, ready for late April. That will aim to combat high oil prices and shield
households from rising food prices, while also supporting SMEs.

Until the new stimulus arrives, Kishida will hope to placate public ire mainly by
subsidizing gasoline. Since January, the government has been subsidizing the portion
of the pump price above ¥172/ liter, sending funds to oil wholesalers to
compensating for their rising costs.

The subsidy cap was initially set at ¥5/ liter, but raised to ¥25 on March 4 after the
Russian incursion into Ukraine. To implement this policy from January to March, ¥430
billion ($3.5 billion) was appropriated from the FY2021 budget reserve.

This measure was supposed to be time-limited until the end of March, but the
government has decided to extend it to the end of April as chaotic scenes around gas
stations could emerge if it was suddenly discontinued.

Further subsidies are more targeted to industry and seek to cool prices for kerosene,
diesel, and fuel oil.

There are other policy tools PM Kishida could deploy. One is a so-called !trigger
clause” introduced when the current opposition parties were in power over a decade
ago. This option temporarily lowers a type of tax on gasoline.

Gasoline is subject to a !gasoline tax” of ¥53.8/ liter, as well as a !petroleum and coal
tax” of ¥2.8/ liter. A 10% consumption tax is applied at the moment of sale. Originally,
the gasoline tax rate was fixed at ¥28.7/ liter, but in the 1970s an additional ¥25.1/
liter was added to finance road construction. Today, this additional portion serves as a
general revenue source.

What a “trigger clause” does is reduce the overall gasoline price by halting this
additional ¥25.1 tax when the price of gasoline exceeds ¥160/ liter for three
consecutive months. The trigger clause was frozen following the 2011 Japan
Earthquake to secure financial resources for reconstruction.

On March 4, when asked about measures to be taken after April, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Matsuno Hirokazu, admitted: “The government will consider all options,
including the trigger clause”.


18


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Lifting the freeze requires new legislation, which is why this method is politically
charged. Introducing a trigger clause would lower tax revenue by ¥130 billion per
month. Supposing it’s in effect for 12 months, then the missed revenue would amount
to ¥1.6 trillion. Since the gasoline tax is inclusive of a local gasoline tax portion, this
option would also hurt local municipality budgets.


Additional efforts
In addition to the demand-side measures, the government has been active in trying to
raise supply. In response to a request from the U.S., Japan has been releasing oil
reserves. At the end of 2021, Japan’s national stockpile had 146 days' worth of
domestic demand. The Oil Stockpiling Act does not permit the sale of oil for price
suppression measures, but the government got around this by claiming that the main
purpose is replacement of the liquid in the tanks.

The three-stage release is due to total about 660,000 kiloliters. The sale of 100,000
kiloliters (630,000 barrels) of oil in February and a further 260,000 kiloliters in March
were done via public tenders. The remaining 300,000 kiloliters is approved for
distribution after May 20 in the third and final round of tenders.

Diplomatic efforts are also in play. On March 15, Kishida spoke with the UAE’s Crown
Prince Muhammad and confirmed that the two sides will work together to stabilize the
oil market. Shortly thereafter, Foreign Minister Hayashi visited the UAE.

Japan’s top three banks are also part of a western consortium that recently agreed to
loan $1 billion to Kuwait Petroleum Corp. to help it expand output.

In the meantime, the oil shock is replacing another one related to nuclear energy.
Potentially for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the majority of
respondents to a survey by a national newspaper said they favor the restart of more
nuclear reactors in the country. The Nikkei survey from late March had 53% of people
calling for restarts. (For more on Japan’s nuclear debates, see the March 14 edition)

There are also national efforts around energy efficiency and conservation.


Conclusion
If history is any indication, the Japanese economy, along with the entire global
economy, could well be entering a period of recession and accompanying difficulties.
The year after the 1973 Oil Crisis, for example, Japan posted negative growth for the
first time in the postwar era – an 8.2% plunge in GDP growth over 12 months.

Precisely because of that past experience, however, Japan and allied governments are
more able and knowledgeable when it comes to mitigating the impact of an
impending energy crisis. The economic fallout after the Lehman Shock, for example,
was staggered over two years and saw a 7% drop in GDP growth over 24 months.

The biggest problems for PM Kishida will be the events that he cannot control and
sudden supply shocks. With President Putin determined to strike back against Western
sanctions, the chance of both of those occurring are not small.

Putin’s Rubles-for-Gas Threat:
Desperate Measure or Start of Bigger Changes?


The global energy community was initially bewildered by Moscow’s threats last week
demanding ruble payment for energy sales. Russian President Vladimir Putin set an
April 1 deadline for the measure, which left some wondering whether it was a
mischievous geopolitical prank. That certainly wasn’t the case.

The threat was real and aimed at "unfriendly nations" which includes Japan, the U.S.,
Australia, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, South Korea, and all EU member states.
With Europe’s economy dependent on Russia for about 40% of gas imports and 25%
of oil, EU leaders began to prepare for possible disruption of energy supplies that
would have had catastrophic consequences.

Germany’s finance minister was the first to reject the notion, saying that energy
contracts can’t be altered. Other EU countries quickly followed suit. Since Russian
energy exports to Japan are much smaller, METI Minister Hagiuda waited a few days
before telling the G7 that Japan won’t accept Russia unilaterally changing contract
terms between private companies.

The political standoff will not surface in energy flows just yet since commodities
already paid for will be delivered as agreed, according to Russia. But from the middle
of April, the impact will start to be seen. With the ruble’s recent rebound, President
Putin is seeking to build on his gambit to subvert the dollar-bound commodity world
order. For the Kremlin, ruble-priced gas is just the beginning.


Brief history of recent events
First, some background. For eight years, Russia and the West have stared each other
down over control of Ukraine, Europe’s largest country after Russia. In the early 2010s,
Ukraine’s government negotiated a political and free trade agreement with the EU,
but in late 2013 then President Viktor Yanukovich made a sudden decision to walk
away from the deal. This sparked protests, which turned violent and resulted in deadly
clashes with the police. By early 2014, Yanukovich fled from Ukraine to Russia and a
new government was formed.

Russia called the ousting of Yanukovich an illegal coup. The U.S. backed the
insurrection, which brought to power a pro-western group. Ethnic Russian separatists
living in the heavily-industrialized eastern Ukraine region of Donbas, however, vowed
not to support the new government and formed a militia. The new Ukrainian regime
engaged in a military campaign against the separatists.

Moscow responded by sending unmarked troops into Crimea and annexing the
predominantly ethnic Russian region. It also sent forces to help the pro-Russian
Donbas militia. The latter’s standoff with the Ukrainian military ground to a stalemate
after six months. The annexation of Crimea sparked a wave of sanctions, though
Japan’s measures against Russia were relatively mild as then Prime Minister Abe

sought to improve Russo-Japanese relations. Western countries also helped to arm
and train Ukraine’s military.

Fast forward to Feb. 24, 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine, claiming it was a
preemptive strike to outwit an alleged planned Ukrainian offensive against the
besieged Donbas region. (Kiev and NATO deny these charges). On Feb. 26, western
allies announced far-reaching sanctions against Russia, the most wide-reaching of
which was freezing the country’s $640 billion in foreign-exchange reserves.

That sent the ruble plunging from 84 rubles to almost 135 rubles per dollar in early
March. White House officials claimed that they had devastated the Russian economy
and reduced the ruble “to rubble”.

Faced with this humiliation, the Kremlin sought to shore up domestic reserves and
stabilize the economy. Russia’s Central Bank raised interest rates to 20% and enacted
capital controls on exchanging rubles for dollars or euros. Until at least the end of
June, the ruble is backed by gold (at a fixed 5,000 rubles per gram).

After the initial wobble, Putin decided to go on the offensive, unleashing a broadside
against the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global trade. Leveraging Europe’s dependence
on energy imports to its advantage, Putin demanded that all “unfriendly” countries
pay Gazprom, the state-controlled gas giant, in rubles. The Kremlin has signaled that
a similar move to rubles will follow for other commodities that Russia exports.



How will rubles-for-gas work?
Except for the UK, where Gazprombank faces sanctions, energy companies can
continue to buy Russian gas and oil in euros, according to Paul Goncharoff, an
American business consultant based in Moscow. The only change is that foreign gas
buyers will need to set up a ruble account in Gazprombank and link it to their euro
account. Then, they’ll have to instruct Gazprombank to transfer the euro payment to
their new ruble account.

“Russian banks have been sanctioned from the western banking and payment system,
rendering it unusable,” said Mr. Goncharoff. “Russia will honor its supply contracts,
receiving from the buyers the same USD or Euro sums due, but converted and paid in
rubles. Now buyers can use the same payment paths that a host of countries like
India, China, and others successfully have done and do.”

As existing contracts run down, western buyers may be asked to pay directly in rubles
for future supplies. In theory, this could still be accommodated if a middleman firm
registered in a neutral, “Russia-friendly” or even offshore jurisdiction was set up to
bridge the currency issue. While such a scheme would be open to many weaknesses,
not least of which is currency risk, it could also keep the flow of gas intact, albeit at a
higher price.

Russia’s government would like to present the situation as not just a sanctions
workaround, but the start of a new world order in international trade. Deputy Foreign
Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that BRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa — will try to create their own economic order, and that the demand for rubles is


21

meant “to protect Russian interests”, but “not a change in the terms of energy
contracts.”

India has already declared that it has and will continue to buy Russian commodities as
this is a matter of energy security. Russia has reportedly offered India oil at a discount
to global market prices.

Furthermore, Russia is talking with its allies to create a new “basket of commodities”
to partially, or wholly back, the ruble.

“This probably would include oil, gas, gold, and grains in a formula based on monthly
settlement prices on globally recognized exchanges,” said Mr. Goncharoff. “It may
well turn out to be quite advantageous to conduct business in rubles, a hard asset-
backed currency. Time will tell.”

Russia’s offensive on the U.S. dollar has sympathies in some non-Western countries.
The IMF and Goldman Sachs have also warned that U.S. sanctions are damaging the
dollar’s leading position because many countries now see Washington as weaponizing
the American currency far too often.

Meanwhile, the ruble has bounced back from its initial post-invasion collapse. As of
April 3, it was at 83.5 to the USD, close to levels before Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.
Putin’s battle to force a change in the payment currency for key commodities, initially
rejected by the G7, is far from over.

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Chile/ Solar power
Atlas Renewable Energy switched on its new 244 MW solar farm, now one of the
country’s largest. Spread over 479 hectares, the plant will generate 714 GWh
annually. Chile plans to retire and/or convert half of its coal-fired power plants by
2025.

China/ Renewable energy
China Shenhua Energy Co. will spend about 40% of its annual capital expenditures on
renewable energy by 2030, reaching peak GHG emissions by 2025 and carbon
neutrality by 2060. Shenhua is a subsidiary of state-owned China Energy Investment
Corp., the country’s biggest coal miner, but also the world’s second-biggest
renewable power developer.
Germany/ Hydrogen power

E.ON and Australia’s Fortescue agreed to develop a hydrogen supply chain.
Fortescue plans to produce and export green hydrogen to Germany to replace about
one third of Russian gas imports. The plan requires $50 billion in investment to
produce 5 million tons of hydrogen.
India/ Renewable energy
Steel giant ArcelorMittal will partner with Greenko Group to develop a 975 MW
around-the-clock wind and solar project. Power from the $600 million project will go
to the company’s JV, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, and will be fully operational by
mid-2024.

Mexico/ Solar power
A $20 million roof-top solar power project will cover Mexico City’s massive outdoor
market, La Central de Abasto. With about 18 MW of generating capacity, the project
is a rare green initiative for the government of President Lopez Obrador, who
prioritizes fossil fuel power generation.

Netherlands/ Fossil fuel financing
ING Group will stop financing new oil and gas projects, becoming the largest bank to
commit to climate change measures. While ING won’t finance projects approved after
Dec. 31, 2021, it will still fund energy firms. Also, ING plans a 50% increase in lending
for renewable energy projects by 2025. In 2021, ING loaned €7.3 billion to renewable
energy development.

Netherlands/ Wind power
The Netherlands will double offshore wind farm capacity to about 10 GW by 2030.
The additional power will particularly help large industrial concerns, such as chemical
and steel plants, switch to sustainable energy.

infrastructure by 2030, building 300 kW and 150 kW ultra-fast charging points to
provide EV drivers with a range of 100 miles in 10 minutes of charging.

UK/ Wind and solar power
The government proposed tripling solar panels and doubling onshore wind power by
2030. Solar would increase from its current capacity of 14 GW to 50 GW; offshore
wind from 11 GW to 50 GW; and onshore wind from 15 GW to 30 GW. In related
news, work began on the first phase of the 3.6 GW Dogger Bank Wind Farm owned
by SSE Renewables, Equinor, and Eni. Also, Ørsted will sell, for £3 billion, its 50%
stake in the 1.3 GW Hornsea 2 Offshore Wind Farm. The buyer is a group that
includes AXA IM Alts and Crédit Agricole Assurances.

U.S./ LNG
A subsidiary of New Fortress Energy will scrap its proposed LNG plant in Pennsylvania
due to an environmental group’s lawsuit seeking to terminate the company’s
emissions permit. The $800 million plant was intended to liquify natural gas from the
Marcellus Shale gas field.

U.S./ Wind power
The first wind energy lease sale for areas off the coast of North and South Carolina will
be held in May. The Interior Department will offer two areas covering 110,000 acres in
the Carolina Long Bay area that could generate as much as 1.3 GW of offshore wind

JOBS   IN  JAPAN’S     ENERGY       SECTOR


BY ANDR EW STATTER
The Great Energy Talent Squeeze

As Japan and the world transitions their energy mix from fossil fuels to renewables and
new fuels, the workforce is transitioning as well.

With new sectors such as offshore wind and hydrogen growing quickly, companies need
to hire more people than experienced professionals exist in the market. With highly
competitive tender processes and immature markets, this creates the challenge of a

market short in qualified candidates.
A clear example of this is seen in the nascent offshore wind industry, where multiple
developers form a consortium, and multiple consortiums compete over the same
project. While there’s only one eventual winner, all of them need to hire qualified talent to

develop proposals. The challenge is compounded by the fact that Japan is going from
<0.1GW to 10 GW of capacity by 2030, and the experienced talent pool is very thin. The
same will be true for years to come.
As offshore wind developers grow and need more people, they are turning to other

renewable sectors in the hunt for staff. Talent in onshore wind, solar power, as well as real
estate and large Japanese trading firms is in high demand.
Many companies are putting emphasis on transferable skills, coupled with a flexible

mindset. This is great news for professionals from other sectors, who can leverage
relevant experience to move into a high-growth market. Skills in particularly high demand
are project management, negotiation with local stakeholders (landowners, local business,
fisheries, municipal governments etc.) commercial negotiations, and financial acumen.

With the right motivation and attitude, as well as support from the employer, members of
the workforce can catch up quickly and learn new industry specifics.
The PV market is in transition, and has plenty of talent experienced in local stakeholder
management. As the oil & gas industry plateaus, we will see more talent adept at

complex commercial negotiations, supply chain management and contract work transition
into the renewables sector.
The energy transition demands flexibility from the government, incumbent companies

and the grid. Companies driving the transition need to show the same flexibility in hiring
in what is currently a developing market.
