Grid Transmission Council warns renewable operators of management shortfalls
(Japan NRG, June 6)
•  Management shortfalls at some renewable operators connecting to the grid network are serious
enough to cause blackouts, said the Transmission and Distribution Grid Council before the four-
ministry panel studying community conflicts and the renewables sector. The Council reported
technical errors in the connection process, absence of contactable on-site managers and cases of

some renewable operators delaying construction, upsetting interconnection schedules. The panel
launched in April and consists of METI and three ministries for infrastructure, agriculture and
environment.
•  CONTEXT: More businesses are installing their own power generators not only on roof tops but
also with biomass, geothermal and other renewable systems that can connect to the grid.
•  METI is likely first to tighten the rules for solar. Small solar power stations under 50 kW do not
need to appoint a technical manager, and those below 5,000 kW are able to appoint external

parties as managers.
•  Transmission networks will become complex as connections with renewables increase. Solar and
wind operators will be adding storage battery systems for connection. The transmission operators
will need to find technical solutions to improve network resilience, because human errors are
bound to increase with more parties interconnecting.




METI to write rules for power serviced by storage batteries
(Japan NRG, June 8)
•  By the end of 2022, METI plans to set rules for supplying power from storage batteries, as solar
and wind operators will be installing battery systems to store redundant power. METI’s tasks
include designing mechanisms to reflect additional battery system costs on the feed-in-tariff and
feed-in-premium rates, setting up systems to accurately measure the amount of electricity from

power generators and storage systems, and deciding how storage batteries fit in the non-fossil fuel
certificates and capacity auction schemes.



Large businesses to report energy transition schedules starting July 2023
(Japan NRG, June 9)
•  Large businesses consuming over 1,500 kl of oil or the equivalent amount of energy annually will

be required to report energy transition schedules starting 2023; the first deadline was set at July
31, 2023. This follows the Energy Conservation Act Amendments that passed parliament last
month and will be enforced in April 2023.

Ex-chair of nuclear regulator says “big mistake” to intervene in watchdog processes
(Bloomberg, June 10)
•  Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) former chairman Shunichi Tanaka, 77, said it was a “big
mistake” for politicians in Japan to intervene in the watchdog’s processes despite criticism that the

state agency was too slow.
•  CONTEXT: Tanaka served as chair from the NRA’s founding in 2012 until 2017. PM Kishida
recently said the regulatory review should be made more efficient.
•  Tanaka noted that many Japanese nuclear reactors have yet to complete upgrades to bring their
anti-terrorism measures in line with new regulations. Rather than focusing public attention on the
regulator, politicians should canvass the public to be more supportive of reactor restarts.
•  One of the longest NRA reviews is at the Tomari NPP in Hokkaido. Tanaka said the review was

stuck because of an inability to determine if the facility stands on an active geological fault. That
decision is based on views of outside experts, but the academics involved “cannot make a
decision”.
•  Tanaka also poured cold water on the idea that Japanese utilities might be interested in SMRs,
saying that small and medium-sized reactors require the same safety levels as large units and the
overall economics do not work.




Mitsui, ENEOS and ADNOC sign hydrogen agreement
(Company Statement, June 7)
•  Mitsui, ENEOS and Abu Dhabi National Oil Corp signed a joint study agreement to produce blue
hydrogen in the United Arab Emirates and export to Japan by converting the molecules into
methylcyclohexane (MCH).
•  The three will verify technologies needed to run a 50,000 tons/ year production facility, and will do

a feasibility study on the potential to expand to commercial production of 200,000 tons/ year.
•  In phase 1, by-product hydrogen generated in the Ruwais Industrial Area will be used. In phase 2,
blue hydrogen will be produced from natural gas. METI minister Hagiuda attended the signing
ceremony.
•  CONTEXT: Japan is the largest buyer of ADNOC’s oil and gas, and ADNOC has businesses with all
oil refiners and integrated trading houses. Cosmo Oil owns shares of ADOC, its upstream arm.

Idemitsu and ADNOC signed a blue ammonia sales agreement last year.



Tokyo Gas and Shell to study projects in CCUS, hydrogen, syngas and more

(Company Statement, June 6)
•  Tokyo Gas and a unit of Shell signed an MoU to study opportunities in synthetic gas, hydrogen,
bio-methane and CCUS to develop new decarbonization solutions.
•  For synthetic gas, Osaka Gas is also involved as a joint study partner.
•  CONTEXT: Tokyo Gas has set a target of introducing synthetic gas equivalent to 1% of its total gas
sales volume as of 2030.

JERA, Tokyo Gas invest in one of world’s top underground CO2 storage hubs
(Nikkei, June 9)
•  JERA, Tokyo Gas and INPEX joined a ¥100 billion ($748 million) project led by Australian energy
company Santos to store CO2 underground.
•  In addition to CO2 as a byproduct of LNG production, the storage facility located near Darwin will

also store CO2 shipped from Japan. The planned CCS plant could store up to 10 million tons of
CO2 a year, aiming for operation around 2025.
•  CONTEXT: This is billed as potentially the world’s largest carbon capture and storage project. At
issue here is also the transport of CO2, which would need to be done in liquid form.




Marubeni and J-Power fund Glencore’s carbon storage project in Queensland
(Company Statement, June 8)
•  Marubeni Corporation and J-Power will each fund A$10 million in Glencore’s CTSCo Carbon
Capture and Storage (CCS) Project in Queensland, Australia. Both Japanese companies are long
term joint venture partners in Glencore’s local mining operations.
•  The CTSCo Project focuses on capturing CO2 from the Millmerran coal-fired power station and

permanently storing it deep underground in a site 100km away.
•  A comprehensive environmental impact assessment is in progress, with the aim of starting CO2
injection in 2025.


Chiyoda, JERA, RITE in CO2 recovery trial

(Nikkei, June 7)
•  A consortium comprising Chiyoda Corporation, JERA, and the Research Institute of Innovative
Technology for the Earth (RITE) began developing technology to absorb CO2 from exhaust gases
emitted by gas-fired power stations, using solid media in the form of amines.
•  Solid absorption media offer cost advantages over liquid counterparts.
•  The consortium aims to perfect the technology by 2024.


Japan Exchange creates terms for issuance of Digitally Tracked Green Bond

(Kankyo Business, June 3)
•  Japan Exchange Group has determined the terms and conditions for the issuance of "Wholesale
Digitally Tracked Green Bond", the first environmental bonds in Japan that will utilize blockchain
and other digital technologies.
•  The first set of issuances in Japan of these bonds will amount to ¥500 million, with each one for
¥100 million. The term of the bonds is one year, and the interest rate is 0.050% per annum. The
funds raised will be used for capital investment in solar and biomass power generation facilities.
•  JPX is collaborating with Hitachi, blockchain specialist BOOSTRY, and Nomura Securities to

develop the new bonds.
•  Earlier statement on the development from JPX: here.

Osaka Gas invests in Australian carbon credits
(Denki Shimbun, June 10)
•  Osaka Gas invested in Australian Integrated Carbon, which specializes in “carbon farming”.
•  The utility acquired a 16.7% stake in AI Carbon for an undisclosed amount.
•  AI Carbon sells carbon credits from projects to regenerate native bush.

•  Osaka Gas hopes to expand its use of carbon credits beyond Australia.


Newspaper investigation finds “ghost” carbon credit projects
(Nikkei Shimbun, June 11)
•  A Nikkei investigation of forest-based carbon credits revealed "ghost projects" in the Central

American region that have ceased operations, but whose certificates are still traded as if the
project is current due to outdated databases.
•  The newspaper identified such a project in southern Belize. In recent years, firms that have bought
credit based on the project’s database include Japan’s JAPEX.
•  CONTEXT: Carbon credits are coined when projects save the emissions of CO2 either by reducing
output at facilities or preventing the emergence of new pollution sources. One category of credits

is for protecting forests, but some say the quality of many forest-related projects is in doubt.


Turquoise' hydrogen offers Japan new path to decarbonization

(Nikkei Asia, June 5)
•  Japanese industrial machinery maker Ebara is working on a new method to produce "turquoise"
hydrogen, hoping to commercialize it by 2026.
•  Turquoise hydrogen is produced from methane contained in natural gas and biogas through a
decomposition process called pyrolysis. Carbon produced in the process is in solid form, and not
released into the atmosphere.
•  The company has teamed up with the National Institute for Materials Science, Shizuoka University
and materials maker Taiyo Koko. State-backed New Energy and Industrial Technology

Development Organization commissioned the project.
•  CONTEXT: Hydrogen can be classified as "green" -- generated by using renewable energy
sources; or "blue," which involves extraction from fossil fuels and uses carbon capture and storage
technology to lessen emissions. Green hydrogen production doesn’t generate CO2, but is costly
due to the amount of energy required, and the difficulty of carbon storage facilities remains an
obstacle to blue hydrogen. Turquoise hydrogen is attractive because of its lower-cost making the
fuel without CO2 emissions.



Mitsubishi Heavy starts study of ammonia co-firing in Indonesia

(New Energy Business News, June 7)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) started a feasibility study for ammonia co-firing at existing
thermal power plants in Indonesia.

Possibility of winter rolling blackouts looms
(Japan NRG, June 7)
•  In January-February, Tokyo area power reserve rates are forecast at -0.5-0.6%, when demand will
outstrip supply. Also, 1.3-2.8% power reserve rates are forecast for Chubu, Hokuriku, Kansai,
Shikoku, Chugoku and Kyushu areas.
•  METI is studying the possibility of issuing orders that enforce power consumption cuts and is

calling to prepare for possible rolling blackouts.
•  METI will also take the lead in securing supply capacity and publicly soliciting companies to
procure additional fuel.
• TAKEAWAY: As reported in the May 23 and June 6 issues of Japan NRG, METI will be issuing alerts two days
before a possible power crunch. The power forecast systems have been fully automated, making accuracy of
input data -- temperatures, humidity, daylight hours, precipitation, and infrastructure data -- crucial. The

conservation drive might lose steam if people feel the alerts are false alarms.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Government calls on consumers to conserve electricity

(Mainichi Shimbun, June 7)
o  Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno made a public plea on June 7 for citizens to conserve
energy during summer.
o  This is the first time since 2015 that the Japanese government has officially requested
citizens to conserve power.
o  Matsuno asked to reduce energy consumption without compromising their standard of
living or business activity.
o  Air-conditioners should be set at 28°C.



TEPCO to roll out demand-response services to 450,000 households
(Denki Shimbun, June 9)
•  TEPCO Energy Partner (EP) will roll out Demand Response (DR) services to households subscribing
to its free rate plans. The company expects up to 450,000 customers to participate in the DR

service between July and September, when the supply-demand power balance will be tight.
•  CONTEXT: DR services allow consumers to be compensated for reducing their power demand or
shifting it from peak times to those with lower general demand. This helps to alleviate the strain on
the electricity grid during peak periods.



Kansai Electric shuts down nuclear reactor for maintenance
(Company Statement, June 6)
•  Kansai Electric will start the regular inspection and maintenance of Unit 4 at its Takahama NPP
(PWR, 870 MW) on June 8.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The facility is due to be offline for about five months, switching back online in late October, and
resuming full-scale output in mid-November.
•  During the inspection, ultrasonic inspection of the reactor vessel welds will be conducted, and
ultrasonic thickness measurements will be made in the secondary system piping.
•  Kansai also said on June 10 it will bring forward the restart of Mihama NPP Unit 3 to mid-July.
• TAKEAWAY: Currently, Japan has just three nuclear reactors online, with only one in the heavily industrial

Kansai region. This does not bode well either for electricity prices nor energy security. For comparison, Japan
had nine nuclear reactors online during the peak July-August period last year. Even if one or two come back
on soon, this would likely only benefit the Kyushu area as those facilities are the closest to restarts.
• The Kansai area will feel the strain the most during this summer, followed by the Tokyo area. It is well within

the realm of possibility that rolling blackouts will be instituted or more subtle messages communicated to
major power users. In the meantime, Japan’s demand for LNG and coal will remain strong to fill in the gaps.

New offshore wind auction rules hurt long-term industry development
(Gendai, June 7)
•  CONTEXT: This is a column by Testsu Machida, an award-winning freelance journalist and an
outside director of Japan Post Bank.
•  The proposed shift in offshore wind auction criteria favoring speed of execution over price will

incur long-term damage to the development of the industry in Japan. It will inevitably lead to
higher power prices.
•  This turn of events worries not only Mitsubishi Corporation, winner of the first round of auctions,
but also other players such as JERA, TEPCO Renewable Power, Kyuden Mirai Energy, and
Sumitomo Corporation.
•  The renewables industry’s reliance on FIT has blunted the cost-competitive edge of many players.

Instead of trying to challenge Mitsubishi on price they pushed the government to alter the terms of
future auctions, thus prolonging the life of a concessionary payment system that keeps them from
reforming their high-cost structures. This is what has kept Japan’s renewables prices high.
•  The government’s proposed new rules could be read as saying that any bid that offers a price
below the auction reference price will receive full points in the price category, rendering further
competition on cost pointless.
•  The government review may be open for public comment as early as September.

•  As a result of all the changes, bidding for the Happo Town and Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture area
rights, scheduled for this month (June 2022), is now expected to be delayed by about one year.

•  A METI report says that in the event of a one in ten-year heatwave, demand for electricity in areas
supplied by TEPCO and Chubu Electric will exceed 97% of capacity.
•  The forecasts for winter are even more pessimistic: a one in ten year cold snap would see
electricity consumption in areas supplied by TEPCO exceed capacity by over half a percent in

January and February.
•  METI is considering imposing restrictions on gas usage, which would be an unprecedented
situation for Japan’s reticulated gas suppliers.
•  Restrictions would be complex to enforce, however, as not all Japanese households are supplied
by reticulated gas. Japan’s gas network is also highly decentralized and relies on a diverse range of
suppliers.
•  Around 10% of Japan’s LNG is sourced from Russia.

• TAKEAWAY: Concern about gas shortages in Japan are rising after the accident at the Freeport LNG facility in
the U.S., which account for 20% of the U.S. export capacity. The plant supplies Japanese buyers such as JERA
and Osaka Gas, with the former’s supplies already affected according to media reports.



LNG stocks rise to this year’s high of 2.14 million tons

(Government Data, June 8)
•  LNG stocks stood at 2.14 million tons as of June 5, the highest so far this year. They were 1.99
million tons a week earlier. The end-June stocks last year were 2.04 million tons. The five-year
average of end-June stocks is 1.95 million tons.


Iwatani acquires a stake in rutile miner Nordic Mining

(Company Statement, June 7)
•  Japan’s largest hydrogen producer, Iwatani Corp, acquired a stake in the Norwegian rutile miner,
Nordic Mining, for ¥2.6 billion. Iwatani did not disclose the stake size. The companies also signed
an off-take agreement where Iwatani takes 20,000 tons/ year, or 60% of Nordic Mining’s rutile ore
production. Iwatani owns a rutile mine in Western Australia and Nordic Mining will be its second
supply base.
•  CONTEXT: Russia and former CIS countries have high shares in the global titanium supply chain,

causing producers and consumers outside the Russian block to review procurement strategies.
Iwatani has a unique approach as most other Japanese rutile ore buyers purchase from India.
•  Rutile ore is smelted and processed into titanium metal used for piping systems of nuclear plants,
aircraft bodies, and weapons. Chemical grade titanium dioxide has a property to absorb carbon
and is used for carbon capture products.

Kishida Opens State Taps to Meet Japan’s 2050 Net-Zero Targets
Japan’s state funds for the energy transformation look set to get bigger and more
numerous in the coming months as Prime Minister Kishida’s drive for a more active
government role filters into policy.

The PM’s Clean Energy Strategy is due to be published this summer. Its early outlines
and ministry announcements, as well as media leaks, suggest a surge in national
spending to levels that, as METI describes it, “have no past comparison.” Japan
needs to invest ¥150 trillion ($1.2 trillion) in decarbonization over the coming decade
in order to meet its 2050 net-zero goals, according to METI.

The funds will flow through various channels and ministries, such as the MoE, which is
finally setting up its own state corporation to direct financing towards clean energy
and power conservation initiatives.

When Japan made its initial net-zero pledge in late 2020, a frequent criticism was how
little government finance was set aside specifically for this task. Now, Kishida is set to
turn on the taps in a big way.


Background
The initial net-zero pledge made by former PM Suga was soon followed by the Green
Growth Strategy. The document outlined 14 sectors that need to grow or modernize
in order to reduce Japan’s emissions, including the creation of an offshore wind
industry.

The Strategy painted broad strokes and promised to establish key pillars such as
guidelines for transition finance, regulatory reform in areas such as hydrogen, offshore
wind, and batteries, as well as revitalized a dying discussion around carbon taxes /
pricing. Indeed, many of these tenets have been built or are on the way.

Yet, the money is where Suga’s policies felt weak. The Green Growth Strategy gave
birth to a Green Innovation Fund. This ¥2-trillion, 10-year institution is now run by
NEDO, under the auspices of METI, and pumps finance into the early-stage R&D of
private companies. As a tool to push high-cost innovation into areas such as “green”
steel, methanation, improved electrolyzers for making ammonia and so on, it has been
arguably a success. But most of these innovations will likely begin their commercial life
at the end of this decade if not later, and will need years to take root.

Kishida’s rush to turn the fiscal taps is about jump-starting projects and tech that can
be applied sooner and at a bigger scale.


MoE’s got a brand-new fund
A good example of the specific nature of government spending under Kishida is a
new state corporation established by the MoE. In contrast to the Green Innovation
Fund, MoE’s excitingly titled Decarbonization Support Mechanism Corp will focus on

products and services that have already reached the stage of commercialization, or
are nearly there.






















Source: NEDO

As the corporation provided financial and other support for projects that the private
sector deems too risky to introduce otherwise, MoE will in effect be helping to scale
up tech that needs the final push to succeed commercially.

Money will flow into floating offshore wind, non-FIT solar, biomass, hydropower, food
and wood waste recycling, geothermal power, the circular economy, electricity
conservation and afforestation projects. Funding methods will include equity
participation, mezzanine finance, and debt guarantees.

The Decarbonization Support Mechanism will be officially set up in October 2022 and
receive about ¥20 billion for its first year. The budget is expected to grow later and
only half will come from government funds as it will be run as a public-private entity.

As Environment Minister Yamaguchi optimistically said, the MoE hopes it will support
a much bigger scale of projects: "To achieve decarbonization we need to do
everything in our capacity and in full force."

Yamaguchi also expressed hope that the entity will help attract large amounts of ESG
funds to Japan’s decarbonization initiatives, adding that whoever controls net-zero
tech will control the next era of industrial development.

MoE’s new entity is expected to operate for 28 years; its current mandate runs to
2051. It will receive initial funds from the national fiscal investment loans (財政投融資)
program and take over the energy conservation projects currently overseen by the
state Green Finance Promotion Organization.

The ministry is reportedly already in talks with companies that may need financial
support from the new entity. This is not an official pre-screening, but an information
collection exercise, says the MoE.


State-backed finance tsunami
The above is only one of several public-private financing initiatives planned by
Kishida. Others include setting up a functional carbon credits market, which officials
hope will not only accelerate corporate efforts to cut emissions but also attract private
money to decarbonization. The market’s current soft-launch phase is known as the GX
(Green Transformation) League.

Another initiative is the government’s plan to issue Japan’s first debt specifically to
fund decarbonization. The so-called green bonds market is already active in Japan
and globally, and more than a dozen countries have sold green bonds to date.
Kishida’s vision, however, is to set a broader mandate for the debt than a typical
green bond, which is reserved for investments in renewable energy.

Kishida’s Clean Energy Strategy is likely to discuss three types of net-zero financing:
Transition, Innovation, and Green, according to a work-in-progress outline presented
by METI. The work of the Asia Energy Transition Initiative (AITI), covered by Japan
NRG in the May 16 issue, will be closely connected with this.

In addition, Kishida wants Japan to pursue “GX Economic Transition Bonds”
(temporary name, Japanese original: ＧＸ経済移行債). As much as ¥20 trillion of such
bonds may be issued this summer. This money would then be channeled to areas
such as hydrogen, ammonia and other non-fossil energies, as well as energy
conservation. The idea is to provide more funding visibility than the annual nature of
government budgets allows.

Non-fossil energy development could also include using the funds raised for
investments in nuclear power, as that is already confirmed by Kishida as a necessary
and CO2-free source for Japan.

Overseeing the bond issuance will be the GX Implementation Council, a new state
panel that will seek to tie all of Kishida’s and his predecessors’ initiatives into a
coherent strategy.

The financing figures and the number of funds, entities, and panels are proliferating
under Kishida. It will be up to the PM to make the larger ecosystem work.

Major Power Utilities Embrace Solar Power’s PPA Model

After years of distrust in green energy pricing models, Japan’s major power utilities
are warming to the business potential of renewables. Recently, a number of the big
utilities (EPCos), ventured into the realm of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for the
first time, testing a business model that offers to boost the adoption of solar power
among Japanese business consumers.

The push into PPAs is led by Hokkaido Electric and Okinawa Electric, both of which
have recently received their first corporate PPA orders. Also, Shikoku Electric has
established a new joint venture with Sumitomo Corp to promote the PPA business
model.

Corporate PPAs are a growing global trend. The scheme has emerged as an effective
means to mobilize private sector capital in support of the energy transition, allowing
renewable energy projects to progress while supplying green electricity for
corporations eager to advance their sustainability goals.

With a typical duration of 10- to 25-years, corporate PPAs create a direct long-term
power supply contract between an electricity generator and a large energy consumer,
which is usually not involved in the energy sector; for example a Big Tech firm, or an
industrial major, such as an aluminum producer.

In 2021, corporations across the globe bought a record 31 GW of clean power
through long-term PPAs, which was a 24% increase on the previous record of 25 GW
set in 2020.

Steady long-term revenue and predictable returns
This April, Japan has started to phase out one of the first catalysts of the renewables
revolutions in the country since 2012. The feed-in tariffs (FIT), which used to apply to
nearly all renewable energy sources, will remain only for a small subset of projects that
have yet to approach market competitive levels.

In FIT’s stead comes the more complex feed-in-premium (FIP) program, which
encourages project operators to invest in other options such as battery storage to
make up for a less lucrative fixed tariff for the initial installation.

The maturing renewables market, and the shift away from FIT, is encouraging
renewable energy companies to explore other options to secure steady long-term
revenue and predictable returns. PPAs offer just that.

In the case of Hokkaido Electric, the first solar PPA contract was signed last summer
with the local unit of Japan’s top supermarket brand, AEON. The utility will own and
install the solar facilities on AEON’s premises as a third party and supply the electricity
they generate.

This arrangement allows the supermarket chain to access “captive” green electricity
without making any initial investment. What’s more, Hokkaido Electric will handle the
inspections of the PV installations and the renewals of ancillary and other equipment,
reducing AEON’s administrative burden.

Hokkaido Electric struck a similar arrangement with another local supermarket chain,
MaxValu, which has stores in a dozen cities and towns across the prefecture. So far,
two MaxValu stores have been equipped with a total of about 660 kW of solar
generation capacity.

At the other end of Japan, last month Okinawa Electric began operating a solar power
system at Urasoe City Minatogawa Junior High School, the first such service for a local
government in the nation’s most southern prefecture.

The 65 kW solar system supplies about 17% of the school’s electricity, resulting in an
annual reduction of about 73 tons of CO2 emissions. In the event of a power outage
due to a typhoon or other disaster, electricity will be supplied from onsite storage
batteries.


PPAs for Big Data companies
Power systems at a school or other municipal facilities are small, but the potential for
onsite power at IT hubs is much larger. Okinawa Electric and Okinawa New Energy
Development are also working with NTT Data and its subsidiaries to provide green
power solutions for Okinawa IT Shinryo Park (Uruma City, Okinawa Prefecture).

The IT hub created by NTT Data in 2014 has grown on the back of strong demand for
BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), providing administrative support, expense
reimbursement, and auditing services for a number of industries. It accounts for
Okinawa’s largest concentration of IT companies and is expected to develop further
as demand for IT and telco services rises.

Starting in December this year, NTT Data will also start to move Okinawa IT Shinryo

19

Park towards carbon neutrality. Initial solar PV installations will serve two of the
buildings onsite. Okinawa Electric will supply the equipment based on a third-party
ownership model, and also set up a mixed woody biomass power generation facility.


A powerful trinity with help from Singapore
Some Japanese utilities are turning to overseas partners to help them introduce the
PPA model in Japan.

In January, Shikoku Electric and Sumitomo Corp, together with Singapore-based
Sunseap Group, launched Sun Trinity LLC. This venture’s remit is to develop and
operate solar power projects in Japan under the PPA model.

In Singapore, Sunseap is developing various forms of solar PPAs, as well as pursuing
the VPP, ESCO, and electric vehicle (EV) charging business opportunities. The
company plans to bring a similarly comprehensive clean energy business model to
Japan.

Capitalized at ¥10 million, Sun Trinity will target PPA solutions for corporations,
municipalities, and other customers. It hopes to marry Sunseap's technological
capabilities and procurement know-how with Sumitomo and Shikoku Electric’s
experience of the Japanese energy market.

The momentum for PPAs is growing. As large Japanese manufacturers worry about
meeting their decarbonization goals or complying with requests by global clients to
switch to green power, the demand for ample, secure electricity from renewable
energy sources is leading many to inquire about PPAs.

For municipalities and the large utilities, not being able to offer a PPA option has
become a major disadvantage. The former fear job losses should corporations switch
factory locations to another part of Japan or even overseas; the latter could simply
lose market share to more nimble and progressive competitors.

As EPCOs see their share of Japan’s electricity market drop below three-quarters of
total, the big utilities know this is no time to resist change. As if net-zero targets were
not enough, their future revenues are at stake.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Oil prices
The price of oil hasn’t stopped rising since Saudi Arabia and other producers pledged
to boost output. Rapidan Energy Group believes that Opec+ will increase output by
only 355,000 b/d in the next two months, which is a fraction of the 3 million b/d of oil
supply that will be lost from sanctioned Russia in the second half of 2022.

Energy crisis
Jeremy Weir, CEO of Trafigura, the global commodity trading company, said that
energy markets were in a “critical” state and the worst of the energy crisis is coming.
“I really think we have a problem for the next 6 months . . . once it gets to these
parabolic states, markets can move and they can spike quite a lot.”

Germany/ Green hydrogen
Hydrogen utility HH2E raised €12 million from investors including HydrogenOne
backed by British tycoon Jim Ratcliffe. Modernizing Germany’s steel industry will be a
priority, but given hydrogen’s high price, weaning German steel furnaces off coking
coal will be expensive.

India/ Green hydrogen
Acme Cleantech Solutions will invest $6.7 billion to build a plant in the southern state
of Karnataka, and which will annually produce 1.2 million tons of green hydrogen and
ammonia. The proposed plant will be built in two phases over the next five years.
Ireland/ Wind power
Wind energy provided 34% of Ireland’s electricity in May, up 9% over May 2021,
according to Wind Energy Ireland. This was the most wind power ever generated for
Ireland in the month of May. Over the first five months of 2022, wind has provided
37% of Ireland’s electricity.

Qatar/ Natural gas
Exxon Mobil, TotalEnergies, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips were chosen as
partners in the expansion of the $30 billion North Field, which will boost Qatar's LNG
output 64% by 2027. The four oil majors are expected to have around 20-25% of the
project’s offtake.

South Korea/ Green steel
Posco, the country's worst polluter and world’s sixth-biggest steelmaker, warned that
making its operations less polluting will benefit Chinese and Indian rivals. Posco wants
to replace coal with hydrogen by 2050, but it estimates that decarbonizing will cost
about $32 billion.

U.S./ Green hydrogen
The Department of Energy will provide a $500 million loan guarantee to finance The
Advanced Clean Energy Storage project in Utah. When built, it will be the world's
largest facility to store green hydrogen and burn it as a fuel for the Intermountain
Power Agency's Renewed Project, a hydrogen-capable gas turbine, combined cycle
power plant due to open by 2045.

U.S/ Natural gas
Freeport LNG, operator of one of the largest U.S. export LNG plants, will shut for at
least three weeks after an explosion at its Texas Gulf Coast facility. Freeport provides
around 20% of U.S. LNG. European gas prices surged on the news.

U.S./ Solar power
The Biden administration will allow 24 months of tariff-free imports from Cambodia,
Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, which are major sources of equipment for U.S. solar
installations. In related news, Biden will use the Defense Production Act to compel
businesses to increase production of certain materials to improve output of solar
panels, building insulation, and power grid transformers.
