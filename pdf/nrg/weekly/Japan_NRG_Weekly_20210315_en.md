Environment Ministry report says renewables can completely replace thermal power

(Japan NRG, March 8)
•  The Environment Ministry’s global environment bureau met to discuss the development of solar
power. According to the bureau’s latest surveys and research, renewables can generate between
1,095.4 TWh and 2,618.6 TWh of power in Japan – enough to completely replace thermal power.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese annual electricity demand is around 977 TWh.
•  Based on the Ministry’s maximum case scenario, offshore wind is able to contribute the most with
close to 60% of total, followed by solar generation.
•  The Ministry estimated the potential for renewables based on what is economically feasible and

additional investments in power transmission. The potential capacity it sees for offshore wind is
between 178 GW and 460 GW. The potential for onshore wind is at 118 GW to 163 GW.
•  Economically feasible solar capacity is seen at 38 GW to 41 GW.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Industry group says Japan should have 125 GW of solar power by 2030

(Japan NRG, March 8)
o  Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association, JPEA, says it aims for Japan to have 31 GW of
residential solar and 94 GW of utility-scale solar installed by 2030.
o  JPEA figures are based on residential solar’s utilization rate of 13.7% and a utility scale
rate of 16%.
o  Utility solar power should drop to ¥7/ kWh by about 2025, JPEA forecasts

Japan considers laying underwater power grid to facilitate offshore wind expansions

(Nikkei, March 13)
•  METI, the main ministry responsible for energy policy, is looking into the possibility of laying an
underwater power grid, which would connect with offshore wind plants to quicker deliver the
power to top demand areas, such as the region around Tokyo.
•  This would be much faster and cheaper to install than running the power along land. The govt.
may need to buy up more land rights.
•  It would also strengthen the power grid specifically for renewable energy.
•  One of the first underwater grid lines could connect Hokkaido and Tokyo.

•  The underwater grid is already a feature of renewable energy in Europe.
•  METI will call an experts meeting on March 15 to discuss the project, possible routes, and cost,
which is expected to go as high as ¥1 trillion.

EDITORIAL: Combination of renewables and nuclear key to energy transition
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, March 10)
•  CONTEXT: Nikkan Kogyo is a business paper aimed at the manufacturing and industrial sectors.
•  The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster taught the Japanese people just how wrong the

government’s assessment of the plant’s safety was.
•  To date, only a few of Japan’s nuclear power plants have been turned back on after being
modified to comply with the new, stricter safety regulations.
•  While low oil prices and the growth of renewables have spared us from higher electricity prices for
the time being, Japan’s over-reliance on fossil fuels poses risks in terms of energy security. Any
change in the political situation in the Middle East could immediately plunge Japan into an energy
crisis.
•  While renewables have a role to play, the recent phasing out of the feed-in tariff system has

lessened investors’ appetite for solar projects, and the need to build additional transmission lines
to carry electricity from solar farms will also result in higher power bills.
•  Japan’s other option is to rethink nuclear energy, which has an excellent cost and emissions profile.

•  Rather than embarking on costly modifications of existing nuclear plants, however, we should be
building new plants that incorporate new technologies, such as small modular reactor technology.
This way, nuclear will be able to play a major role in Japan’s decarbonization.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Young ruling party lawmaker urges Japan PM Suga to abandon nuclear
(Bloomberg, March 10)
o  LDP lawmaker Akimoto Masatoshi gives an interview to Bloomberg in which he claims
that he was one of a group of younger, non-faction-affiliated lawmakers who helped the
current prime minister into power.
o  Akimoto says his stance is anti-nuclear, because the cost of maintaining atomic power is
too high and the country can meet its power needs with offshore wind and solar.

o  Akimoto also claims that he has discussed energy policy with PM Suga, and the prime
minister told him that he’s not a supporter of nuclear power.



Nissan and Mitsubishi to roll out electric minicar for under $18,000

(Asia Nikkei, March 10)
•  Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors plan to launch an electric minicar as early as next year. It will
cost less than ¥2 million ($18,400) after subsidies, which is close to the price of a conventional
gasoline car.
•  The partners are jointly developing a so-called kei (light or mini) car with a common platform and
battery. Because mini-cars are typically used for short-range day-to-day driving, one battery charge
will be limited to around 200 km.



Sumitomo Mitsui Construction to start operation of floating solar power plant

Goldman Sachs considers sale of Japan Renewable Energy stake for $2.5 billion
(Bloomberg, March 9)
•  The financial group is exploring the sale of its 75% stake in Japan Renewable Energy, which might
go for $2.5 billion.
•  The bank is using its own team and Bank of America to shop the asset to potential buyers.

•  Goldman set up Japan Renewable Energy in 2012 to invest in solar and wind power in Japan soon
after the government introduced high Feed-In Tariffs for renewables.

after the Fukushima accident. It also fits a recent trend of exits from the country’s solar market, indicating a
changing of investor profile in the Japanese renewables space.




Kyushu Electric will restart its final offline reactor on March 17
(Japan NRG, March 12)
•  Kyushu Electric said in a press statement that it plans to restart Unit 4 of its Genkai NPP on March
17, with commercial operations sending electricity to the grid due to commence on March 19.
•  The unit was offline for regular maintenance.
•  Kyushu EPCO already has three of its four reactors in operation, and with Unit 4 at Genkai, all of

these will have been restarted in the last 3-4 months. Given the traditional 18-month term before
maintenance, the utility should be well equipped to deal with this summer and next winter’s peak
loads.
• TAKEAWAY: Anti-nuclear activist lawsuits might still hinder the utility’s nuclear operations, however. Kyushu
won two judgements on March 12, but numerous cases by citizen groups are pending against all Japan’s
nuclear facilities. Once considered to be a low-risk event, the situation changed after an Osaka court ruled last

year against Kansai Electric. This could be the biggest risk for the industry this year, and one the government
has almost no control over.

Tokyo Gas, Toshiba establish carbon-neutral LNG alliance
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, March 10)
•  A group of 15 corporations announced on March 9 the establishment of what they’re calling the
“CNL Buyers Alliance” to promote “carbon neutral” LNG. This refers to LNG sold together with

carbon offset credits, which represent the same value as the CO2 in the LNG cargo.
•  The consortium comprises Tokyo Gas, Asahi Group Holdings, Isuzu, Olympus, Sakai Chemical
Industry, Duskin, Tamagawa Academy, Toshiba, Toho Titanium, New Otani, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust
Bank, Mitsubishi Estate, Yakult, Marunouchi Heat Supply, and Lumine.
•  Tokyo Gas currently uses carbon credits purchased from Shell to make its LNG carbon neutral
plans. The consortium will now look at adding other suppliers of credits to future LNG sales.
•  Tokyo Gas VP Nohata said the company is trying to increase the CNL Buyers club in Japan.
•  CONTEXT: In 2019, Tokyo Gas was the world’s first importer of carbon-neutral LNG, supplied by

Shell.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan NRG reported on Feb. 15 the details on the momentum gathering behind carbon neutral
LNG in the country. This announcement by Tokyo Gas indicates that the process is happening even faster than
we estimated. The CNL Buyers Alliance suggests that Tokyo Gas already has 14 buyers for carbon-neutral LNG
packages. In addition, as Japan NRG reported last week, Mitsui has announced the import of another carbon-
neutral LNG cargo and its resale to Hokkaido Gas. That deal represents one cargo of about 64,000 tons, which

is about 10% of Hokkaido Gas’s annual LNG purchase volumes. The LNG is due to arrive this month. By 2030,
gas industry experts suggest that as much as 5% of Japan’s LNG will come in via carbon-neutral cargos, which
would indicate a volume of close to 4 million tons.

Slow start in EVs and Fuel Cell auto infrastructure;
Government looks for incentives to speed up shift

As Japan embarks on plans to decarbonize its economy, the government has begun
to take stock of the situation in transport. Initial findings from a recently created
carbon-neutral mobility panel provide a sobering picture. Both electric vehicles (EVs)
and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells (FCVs) face a severe shortage of refueling
options outside a few central areas.

FCV infrastructure rollout, in particular, is far off course in terms of meeting the needs
of the 200,000 FCV units that Japan expects to have on the road by 2025. Should this
number actually materialize, the mismatch with the availability of service stations could
be vast.

The government’s carbon-neutral mobility panel also put forward several
recommendations for how to incentivize the development of FCV and EV
infrastructure. Most look to improve the end-user experience and see domestic
tourism and local government purchases as the biggest factors driving FCV and EV
sales in coming years.

Decarbonizing transport is one of the priorities in Japan’s 2050 net-zero emissions
agenda, and METI has recently created its first policy unit dedicated to the task. The
carbon-neutral mobility panel held its inaugural meeting earlier this month, aiming
first to assess the state of the sector and put forward basic recommendations.

Representatives of the EV and FCV infrastructure industries delivered reports on the
state of their progress to the panel, while local governments from Nagano and
Yokohama discussed their efforts in proliferating the use of non-gasoline vehicles.

FCVs
The presentation from Japan’s Hydrogen Alliance, JHyM, showed that the country has
recorded the sale of 4,337 FCVs as of the end of 2020. That’s up from 3,633 units at
the end of the previous year, a 19.4% increase. For context, there were 23,354 FCVs
sold worldwide at the end of 2019, according to data compiled by IEA.

While FCV sales have inched up since the launch of Toyota’s second-generation Mirai
fuel cell saloon, the growth trend in refueling infrastructure was less impressive. Japan
added 24 hydrogen service stations in FY2020, bringing the total to 162 nationwide.
During this fiscal year 2021, another 21-25 stations will be built, according to JHyM.

These service station additions have the industry’s growth in line with a government
roadmap, according to JHyM. However, if Japan continues at this pace, which
averages about 20 stations / year, the nationwide network would number just 250-260
stations at the end of 2025. That would see each station service about 784 FCVs a
day, based on the government’s figure of 200,000 FCVs predicted to be on the road.

At present, the average Japanese hydrogen refueling station services less than 32

FCVs a day. In comparison, Japan has about 31,000 gasoline and diesel service
stations serving about 68.9 million autos.

What’s more, the distribution of hydrogen stations is currently uneven. The Tokyo and
Aichi area account for 62.6% of all FCVs in Japan. However, the two areas account for
35.7% of the hydrogen service stations.

A quarter of Japan’s prefectures have no hydrogen refueling infrastructure at all, while
most of the current service areas are clustered in central Japan.

EVS
The infrastructure story repeats itself for electric charging points, which number about
30,000 in Japan, or about 10 locations for every EV in the country, according to
official data. The number of fast chargers, however, is only at about 6,500.

The industry is particularly vulnerable because current first-generation EV fast-chargers
have a short life span of just 8 years, and many of Japan’s facilities will need replacing
or upgrading in the 2022 to 2024 period, according a report delivered to the
government panel by e-Mobility Power.

That’s despite the fact that most of the current EV infrastructure has low utilization
rates. The run rates range from 1% to 9%, with the higher percentage for those
installed in car dealerships, according to Nomura Research Institute data cited by e-
Mobility.

What’s more, most of the current charging infrastructure is in cities but in not-easy-to-
access locations. The coverage area has lots of “blind” spots, also concentrated in the
north and southern parts of Japan, where there are no fast chargers within a 10 km2
area.

Part of the slow rollout for EV chargers is the facilities’ low profitability. Even at higher
run rates, EV charger margins are thin and long lines start to form as soon as run rates
reach 20% or more. There’s also a lack of available space for charging in parking
areas.

For the EV charging market in Japan to become sustainable and independent of
government support, around 1 million to 1.5 million charging points need to be
operating, according to e-Mobility Power estimates.


Strategies for growth
Initial carbon-neutral mobility panel findings called for the government to except non-
gasoline engine vehicles from highway tolls, for them to have priority in public
parking, and to introduce additional subsidies for their purchase and refueling.

One other interesting driver for Japan’s switch to EVs and FCVs will come from
regional governments. In addition to buying CO2-free vehicles for their own fleet,
officials from Nagano prefecture said they are planning tourism campaigns focused on
EV and FCV drivers with offerings such as special and restricted parking spaces,
preferential access to certain nature areas and other benefits.

Nagano also plans to add more EV and hydrogen service stations.

While seemingly a small perk, giving EV and FCV travelers greater and better access
to popular domestic resorts and parks could play a notable role in Japanese sales of
the vehicles. Such incentives would promote EVs and FCVs as more than a one-for-
one replacement for gasoline vehicles, and add to existing subsidies.

Whether the government will be able to promote the wider use of both EVs and FCVs,
however, remains in doubt, given limits on infrastructure investments and subsidies.
One way to judge which technology will win out, then, may be to look at the
purchasing plan of Nagano prefectural government. As it switches the regional fleet to
non-polluting autos, its spending plan reads: 25 EVs; 2 FCVs.

Japan’s Wind Capacity Growth Set a Record Last Year

Wind power capacity in Japan rose to 4,372 MW at the end of 2020, after a record
449 MW was added during the year. The country had 2,531 wind turbines as of Dec.
31, 2020, which is 141 units more than the previous year after 19 new wind power
stations came online, according to preliminary figures released by the Japan Wind
Power Association (JWPA).

Eight years have passed since the enactment of environmental assessment legislation
in October 2012, and several large-scale projects have started operations. In April,
Japan’s largest wind farm the Tsugaru Wind Power Station (121.6MW) was brought
online by Green Power Investment in Aomori prefecture. The following month, in
Akita prefecture, Wenty Japan, Mitsubishi Corporation Power, and Seatech starting
operating the Akita Katagami Wind Farm (65.99MW).

Other notable additions are the Setana Osato Wind Farm (50 MW) in Hokkaido, the
Nikaho No. 2 Wind Farm (41.4 MW) in Akita, and the Kuzumaki No. 1 Nikaho power
plant (44.6MW) also in Akita.

In terms of installation volume by prefecture, Akita ranked first with 646 MW; Aomori
ranked second with 624 MW; and Hokkaido ranked third with 507 MW. By region,

Tohoku has 1,561 MW, which is about three times that of other areas, followed by the
island of Kyushu with 530 MW, and the island of Hokkaido with 507 MW.

GE was the most widely used maker of wind turbines installed last year, and its
turbines accounted for 201.47 MW of the installed volume, which is 42% of the total.
Germany’s Enercon was second with 133.22 MW (27%), and Siemens Gamesa
Renewable Energy was in third with 84 MW (17%). Hitachi, the only Japanese
producer, was in fourth place with 65.599 MW (14%).


















Offshore capacity lagging behind
In terms of offshore wind power installations, at the end of 2020 Japan had a total of
58.6 MW in capacity spread across 28 units in seven power stations. This total
includes “semi-offshore” wind power, which can be accessed from the coast.

If we count only pure offshore facilities, as in those with a berthing distance of two km
or more, the capacity total shrinks to 14.4 MW from five units at four power plants. Of
these, 12 MW (four units at three power projects) are floating offshore wind facilities:
the 2 MW project off the coast of Goto City, Nagasaki Prefecture; the 3 MW unit near
Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka Prefecture and two units (2MW and 5MW) near Fukushima
City, Fukushima Prefecture. The Fukushima units have since been marked for
decommissioning.

The remaining 2.4 MW of offshore capacity is from a single bottom-fixed turbine unit,
such as those commonly used in Europe, stationed near Choshi, Chiba prefecture.

New projects are also starting in port and bay areas. Construction has begun on a
project at Akita Port (55 MW) and at Noshiro Port (88 MW), both in Akita prefecture
and both slated for commissioning in 2022.

For true offshore in the open, bidding has opened for four sites (1.5-1.8 GW in total):
- Goto City, Nagasaki prefecture (floating type);
- Choshi City, Chiba prefecture;
- Yurihonjo, Akita prefecture (north and south),
- Noshiro Mitane Oga, Akita prefecture.
Winners of the four areas will be decided in 2021.

Japan’s Nuclear Industry 10 Years After Fukushima Accident: Status Report

The last 12 months: worst drop-off in capacity in years.



















Restart momentum from 2014 to 2015 is lost.
o  Less than 1/3 of reactors that applied have been able to restart operations so far
o  Less than half of those that did restart are in operation as of today
o  No reactors have been restarted in more than 2.5 years



Regulatory process stuck?
o  Only one restart approval made by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) in the last
three years
o  Some of the NRA reviews are coming up to their ninth year
o  Lack of time limit for decision-making directly hurts the business case for restarts since
the additional time translates into additional cost

o  Several of the reviews are locked in seemingly subjective consideration around whether a
reactor sits on an active fault


Issues arise as time passes.
o  The average age of the Japanese nuclear fleet has increased. It was at ~24 years in 2011

and stands at ~29 years today.
o  Older reactors require more maintenance, which translates into higher costs
o  Problems with recruiting young staff add to the aging workforce
o  Traditional nuclear suppliers turning business to focus on other energy sources
(ammonia, hydrogen, offshore wind, etc.)

Will nuclear play a role in the 2050 net-zero emissions goal?
o  Without new construction, nuclear’s role will be limited. Even if all the current reactors
win a 20-year license extension, allowing them to run to 60 years, only 15 will be eligible
to operate at the end of 2050.
o  Without the 20-year extension, Japan will have zero reactors operable by 2050.

o  There are three mid-construction projects in Japan. One of these is owned by TEPCO,
which makes it an even higher-risk project in terms of realization.
o  Japan’s new energy strategy outlined at the end of last year lumps nuclear with thermal
energy, the first such categorization of the two and an unusual step. Some industry
experts suspect that it indicates the government is not committed to nuclear power over
the longer term.



Recent green shoots of recovery.
o  Kansai Electric seems to have made progress in winning support from the local govt. in
Fukui prefecture to restart its nuclear assets (which are all in that prefecture). Evidence to
this is this month’s unexpected restart of Takahama Unit 3 and the utility’s announcement

that Unit 4 will go online in April.
o  METI minister Kajiyama seemingly played a major part in resolving the gridlock between
Kansai Electric and Fukui govt. This shows a more proactive stance from the govt. than
was visible in the last few years.
o  Kansai Electric could see all seven of its reactors restart this year, should the govt support
continues.
o  Hokkaido Electric has indicated that its long-running debate with the NRA over whether

its Tomari NPP lies on an active fault may be edging to a favorable resolution. That could
“unlock” 3 more reactor restarts.
o  Tohoku Electric has won final local approvals to restart Unit 2 of Onagawa NPP. Actual
operations won’t restart until FY2022 due to ongoing work on additional safety measures.
The approval should encourage Tohoku to apply to restart Unit 3 of the same NPP.
o  January’s electricity price spike reinforced a concern among many in the govt. and
business circles that renewable energy needs a “sparring partner”.



Forecast for 2030:
o  We expect nuclear power’s ratio to drop in the revised 2030 energy mix due to be
published this summer. The stated drop is unlikely to be drastic as the govt. will not want
to show that it is abandoning nuclear power. Still, we see the ratio dropping at least

three to five percentage points from the current 20% to 22% band.
o  Japan may move towards some form of consolidation in the nuclear industry. In part, this
will be to phase out the TEPCO brand and allow a new entity to take over Kashiwazaki
Kariwa NPP and complete the construction of Higashidori NPP.
o  We expect some funding to go toward SMR program and possibly other nuclear tech
programs to retain Japanese capabilities and to provide options for the hydrogen-society
supply chain.

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Coal:
China failed to announce any specific plans to reduce or impose moratoriums on coal-
fired power plants in the NPC meetings last week, disappointing many analysts.
However, China has told Bangladesh that it will no longer fund coal mining or coal-
fired power stations through its Belt and Road platform.
Bangladesh, Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia cut 62 GW of newly planned coal
projects in 2020. Now, India also cut planned new coal projects (from 240 GW in 2015
to 30 GW).
Some analysts are calling for coal assets to be stripped out into separate legal entities
or alternatively establish a ‘bad bank’ to take over coal assets.
HSBC announced that it would overhaul its coal financing activities and set targets for
reduction of exposure to carbon intensive assets. AXA, the French insurer, will no
longer provide insurance cover to Germany’s RWE because of its coal investments.

Batteries:
Tesla is expected to construct a 100 MW energy storage plant near Houston as part of
an expansion plan into residential energy technology.

Tesla & China:
Tesla may be conducting much of its EV tech development in China, according to the
Eurasia Group. The Shanghai factory is based on advanced robotics and automation
processes developed in the U.S., and uses a lot of Kuka robots, a German maker
bought by China’s Midea. On advanced battery technology, Tesla is partnering with
Chinese EV battery leader CATL. Tesla may be relying on Chinese government
support and preferential loans, with Tesla benefiting from “made in China 2025” and
other industrial policies. As Musk has close ties to the U.S. military sector via SpaceX,
his investments in China may get much closer attention from the new U.S. govt.

Shipping:
Hapag-Lloyd, the German shipper, placed an order for six new container ships that
can carry up to 23,000 containers each to meet demand for Europe-China trade.

Aviation:
GE will sell GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), its aircraft leasing business (1,600
aircraft), to Ireland’s AerCap for $30 billion. The combined leasing company will own
over 2,000 aircraft, or 7% of the global fleet, and will have almost 20% of the jet
leasing market, making it industry leader. GE is expected to use the $24 billion in cash
proceeds to pay off debt. The sale effectively terminates GE Capital.

Climate Change:
1). China and the U.S. agreed to co-chair a G-20 group of study groups focused on
climate-related financial risks.
2). The UN criticized global pandemic recovery plans for only allocating 18% to green
investments when emissions need to fall by 7% annually by 2030.

22

ESG:
The EU introduced new rules covering sustainable finance disclosure regulations
(SFDR) last week that are meant to avoid “greenwashing” by the asset management
industry. The new rules will apply to all asset managers who raise funds in the EU.

China:
1). For the first time since the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, the EU will impose
sanctions later this month against four Chinese individuals and one entity concerning
human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
2). CNOOC, China’s largest offshore oil producer, was delisted in New York.

South Korea:
LG Energy Solution will invest $4.5 billion in U.S. battery production by 2025, creating
over 10,000 jobs in the U.S.

Hong Kong:
China Evergrande, the Chinese property company, is diversifying into EVs through a
listed HK subsidiary, Evergrande New Energy Vehicle, that now has a market
capitalization of $63 billion.
Three other US-listed Chinese EV companies are thought to be planning HK IPOs, Li
Auto, Nio, and Xpeng, which could collectively raise $5 billion.

Malaysia:
AirAsia Group, the Malaysian LCC, will launch a four-seater air taxi service and a drone
delivery service as part of a diversification strategy.

Singapore:
Singapore plans to increase investments in solar power four-fold by 2025 and a further
50% by 2030 as it seeks to green its electricity mix. Emphasis is being placed on
floating solar farms.

India:
Shipping Corp. of India, the country’s largest shipper, has been put up for sale by the
government. Vedanta, an oil and gas producer, is one of the bidders.

Myanmar:
France’s Total, Thailand’s PTT and Chevron are being urged to halt royalty payments
for the Yadana offshore gas field to Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise following U.N.
accusations of “crimes against humanity” by the junta. The U.S. is offering 1,600
Myanmar citizens in the U.S. ‘protected status’. One Japanese business was burned
down last week for failing to comply with the nation-wide strikes while a major
Japanese firm has ceased all operations in the country.

Australia:
Former Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is advocating for further
significant investments in pumped hydro storage while the infrastructure for green
hydrogen is built out.

Russia:
Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will discuss regional conflicts, energy and
investment cooperation during a Gulf tour later this month. He will visit the UAE,
Saudi Arabia and Qatar to discuss regional issues, such as Iran, after the Gulf

reconciliation and the expansion of economic ties through more investments and
further coordination of oil production within the OPEC+ group.

Israel:
1). The U.S. government reimposed sanctions on Dan Gertler, the Israeli mining
magnate, for corruption committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Gertler was
a close associate of Joseph Kabila, the former Congolese president.
2). The Israeli prime minister was unable to complete his first trip to the UAE this week
due to restrictions in Jordanian and Saudi air space that prevented his travel. A
general election will be held in Israel on Mar. 23.

Iran:
1). Iranian oil exports to China are now thought to have averaged over 300,000 barrels
a day over the last 14 months, with a significant increase in Q4 2020.
2). An Iranian container ship, owned by the state-run shipping company, was
damaged in an attack in the Mediterranean on Wednesday. Iran will take legal action
to identify the perpetrators of what it called “terrorism” and naval piracy. The Shahre
Kord vessel was slightly damaged in the incident by an explosive object that caused a
small fire but there were no injuries.

Saudi Arabia:
1). The EV start-up, Lucid Motors, will build an assembly plant in Saudi Arabia. It’s
backed by the country’s sovereign wealth fund, the PIF, to the tune of $1 billion.
2). The Ras Tanura oil export terminal was attacked last Sunday by missiles and drones
launched by the Houthis. There were no injuries or loss of life.



















Mozambique:
Mozambique’s President Filipe Nyusi has fired the head of the army and the air force
amid a brutal Islamist insurgency in the Cabo Delgado province that may impact the
Mozambique LNG project led by France’s Total and partially financed by Japan.

Greece:
Public Power Corporation, the state utility, raised E650 million through a sustainability-
linked junk bond sale, the first of its kind, with a coupon slightly less than 4%.

Sweden:
The Swedish battery company, Northvolt, will acquire the U.S. battery start-up
Cuberg, which has focused mainly on storage for the aviation industry until now.

Germany:
Saudi Arabia has signed an MOU with Germany for the production of hydrogen.

United Kingdom:
1). Cairn Energy, the UK oil and gas group, reported a loss of almost $70 million for
FY2020 and will acquire Royal Dutch Shell’s Egyptian Western Desert assets for almost
$650 million with Chevron.
2). Royal Dutch Shell appointed Sir Andrew Mackenzie, the former CEO of BHP, as
chairman to oversee a strategy to reduce its dependence on oil.
3). The UK will announce the establishment of a new infrastructure bank later this
month.

Canada:
Canada has issued new carbon credit trading regulations that are expected to create
opportunities for farmers, foresters, the waste industry, and indigenous communities
to earn revenues from projects that cut GHG emissions. Canada aims to cut emissions
by 30% vs. 2005 levels and plans to be net-zero by 2050.

U.S.:
1). Chevron will increase investments in clean energy to $3 billion by 2028 while flat-
lining its oil and gas investments. CAPEX on new oil and gas projects will be limited to
between $14 billion and $16 billion a year, a decrease of almost 50%.
2). The U.S. Interior Department has cleared the construction of the 62-turbine
Vineyard Wind project off Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. The project will have a
generation capacity of 800 MW and will cost $3 billion. Copenhagen Infrastructure
Partners and Iberdrola are the developers.
3). Several energy companies in Texas including Vistra Energy, NRG, and Exelon
continue to suffer valuation drops following the Texas freeze. Just Energy, a retailer,
has also issued a ‘going concern ‘warning.
4). Following the successful passage of the U.S. stimulus bill through both houses of
Congress last week, all eyes are now on a potential $4 trillion infrastructure package
that may have a significant impact on the energy complex.
5). Piedmont Lithium Ltd, a North Carolina lithium miner, is expected to launch the
first new lithium mine in the U.S. in decades. Lithium prices have surged by over 100%
since last summer to $13,000 per ton.
6). Hawaii declared a state of emergency last week following heavy rains that could
have caused dam failures in Maui`1`.
7). The U.S. Senate confirmed Michael Regan as administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency last week.
8). John Kerry visited London, Brussels, and Frankfurt in his first overseas trip as U.S.
