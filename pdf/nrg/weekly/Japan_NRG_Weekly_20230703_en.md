Sapporo-Hokkaido seeks ¥150 billion investment in energy transition over 10 years
(City of Sapporo statement, June 24)
•  Hokkaido Pref and Sapporo city have created a “Team Sapporo-Hokkaido”, composed of 21
companies including Hokkaido Electric (HEPCO), Hokkaido Gas, financial companies, etc, to
expedite the Green Transformation (GX).
•  The consortium aims to make Sapporo a global GX hub where information, human resources,

finance and more come together.
•  The consortium seeks investment of over ¥150 billion in the next 10 years, from governments and
industries, as well as investment from global financial companies.
•  The team consists of: City of Sapporo, Hokkaido Pref, Financial Service Agency, METI, Ministry of
Environment, Hokkaido Local Finance Bureau, Hokkaido Bureau of Economy, Trade and Industry,
Hokkaido Regional Environmental Office, Hokuyo bank, Hokuhoku Financial Group, Mitsubishi UFJ
Bank, Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, Development Bank of Japan, Japan Green Investment

Corp. for Carbon Neutrality (JICN), Hokkaido University, Hokkaido Economic Federation, Hokkaido
Chamber of Commerce, Sapporo Stock Exchange, HEPCO, and Hokkaido Gas.
• TAKEAWAY: Hokkaido is considered to be Japan’s most favorable region for wind power. The main challenge,
however, will be building transmission capacity to transfer the power generated to major urban centers. This
means sizable investment is required.

• These kinds of announcements can seem largely bureaucratic, but it is expected that the actions in Sapporo
City, and Hokkaido as a whole, will achieve meaningful progress and make an impact on Japan’s net-zero
commitments. PM Kishida’s desire to bind the energy and digital transformations of the country work well in
Hokkaido, where the govt also hopes to station a major semiconductor manufacturing hub.




EneCoat Technologies, Toyota Motor to develop perovskite solar cells
(Japan NRG, June 27)
•  EneCoat Technologies, a Kyoto University startup for next-gen perovskite solar cells (PSC) and

Toyota Motor, which has been developing crystalline silicon solar cells, agreed to co-develop PSC
for EVs.
•  Overseas, research on the “tandem PSC”, which combines PSC and the widely used silicon layers,
is mainstream as the tandem prototypes record higher efficiency than silicon cells. However,
Japanese PSC research focuses on silicon-free cells.
•  Toyota Motor told Japan NRG that its first goal is to develop PSC prototypes for cars. The
development of tandem cells is one possibility, adding that it’s still unsure how effective the

tandem structure is in boosting power efficiency.
•  CONTEXT: Earlier this year, EneCoat launched R&D with Toyoda Gosei, an automotive component
maker in the Toyota group. Toyota Motor’s participation will speed up development of PSC in cars.

However, the automaker will need to build relations with EneCoat cautiously to maintain good
relations with its suppliers in PSC development, and to maintain some degree of “PSC technology
independence.” Aisin, another Toyota company, has been developing PSC since 2014. Kaneka,
which supplies crystalline silicon solar panels to the automaker, is one of the few Japanese
companies involved in tandem PSC research.

• TAKEAWAY: Previously PSC was called “the next-gen solar cell for outer space” because of its high lead
content, discouraging applications involving direct human contact such as cars and appliances. It’s unclear if a
breakthrough has been achieved for safe handling of PSC raw materials, but field studies in the sector are
spreading. PSC applications on farms is a promising area, but no companies are as yet known to be active in
this space.

Toyota Motor, EneCoat         PSC-equipped cars

???                           Solar power station in farms

• Japan NRG expects companies to work in an alliance with universities to develop this technology. Key players

other than the aforementioned include: Fujifilm, Panasonic, Mitsubishi Chemicals, Zeon, Hosiden, Ricoh,
Semiconductor Energy Laboratory. Tokyo Chemical Industry, Peccell Technologies, Tokyo University, and
University of Hyogo. The much-awaited next major tech breakthrough would be to establish mass production.




ANRE drafts new regulations for renewables under GX Act
(Japan NRG, June 30)
•  ANRE unveiled preliminary draft regulations for renewables operators following the enactment of
the GX Decarbonization Power Supply Act. The goal is to foster harmony between renewables
operators and community stakeholders.

•  Companies launching new renewables projects are required to hold town meetings, except in case
of small 0-50 kW projects in uninhabited areas. ANRE drafted guidelines including a requirement
to hold a Q&A session in the meetings.
•  Operators will be held liable for their contractors, and contracts need to be in writing, including
clauses on compliance to law and regulations.
•  There will be penalties if operators violate laws; if the infringement continues, then the govt will

suspend Feed-in-Tariff and Feed-in-Premium payments.
•  The new rules take effect in April 2024, following more discussions.

Negative emissions study group makes policy recommendation
(Government Statement, June 28)
•  A Study Group on Creating Negative Emissions Market, composed of nine members from
academia, banks and think tanks, published a policy recommendation for creating markets for

negative emissions tech (NET).
•  The group studied the potential and drawbacks of major tech including direct air capture (DAC),
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), blue carbon, enhanced weathering,
forestation and biochar.
•  Blue carbon and enhanced weathering hold high potential due to Japan’s natural features such as
the world’s sixth largest exclusive economic zone ocean area, while DAC is seen as constrained by
limited space.

•  The group advised the govt to:
o  subsidize if there are gaps between what the market is willing to pay and the value
sought by NET project operators based on investment and R&D costs;
o  “purchase” NET projects and convert them into carbon offset credits;
o  introduce tax incentives;
o  include NET in the emissions trading framework;
o  mandate heavy emitters to purchase NET-derived credits.

•  CONTEXT: Japan has included blue carbon emission reduction in the FY2022 carbon inventory
report to the U.N., after developing its measurement methodology. The country is said to require
several hundred million tons/year of NETs derived emission cuts through 2050 to offset carbon
from hard-to-abate sectors. Its annual blue carbon potential is pegged at 1.32 million tons.
• TAKEAWAY: METI is expected to soon draft the “CCS business act” as carbon capture and storage (CCS) is
one of the quickest approaches to reducing emissions from the power sector. The new law is likely to address

legal requirements associated with CCS and DACCS.


Final safety inspection for Fukushima NPP water release begins, IAEA head to visit Tokyo

(Japan NRG, June 29)
•  Japanese regulators began a final safety inspection of a system to release water treated with an
advanced liquid processing system that removes most radionuclides except for tritium, from the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP into the Pacific Ocean.
•  The permit for the water release could be issued within a week, and the NPP owner, TEPCO, may
start discharging the water soon after. Local fishing groups and neighboring countries have
expressed concerns about safety.

•  CONTEXT: Japanese officials say that the water, which is stored in tanks at the plant, needs to be
removed to prevent leaks and make space for further decommissioning works. The water will be
diluted to safe levels and released over decades. No matter how low the radiation will eventually
be, the release of the water will attract concern and criticism. Some scientists still recommend
delaying the release, while others call for more transparency. Japan has sought support from the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has so far backed the actions taken by TEPCO

as appropriate.

IAEA chief to meet with PM Kishida to discuss Fukushima water release
(Japan NRG, June 30)
o  The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi will meet with PM
Kishida on July 4 to give a final safety assessment on the water discharge.
o  During his four-day stay, Grossi will inspect the damaged nuclear facility.

o  Kishida's government will examine the IAEA assessment before making a formal decision
to discharge the water.


METI to set up organization for CCUS promotion

(Denki Shimbun, June 26)
•  METI and the ANRE are setting up a "Carbon Management Division" in the Resource and Fuel
Department to promote Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.
•  The new organization will shape the future of CCUS initiatives in Japan and promote the sector’s
development.
•  Also, ANRE will establish a Hydrogen and Ammonia Division within the Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Department.
•  A new International Resource Strategy Office will be in charge of designing the green

transformation and a resource diplomacy strategy.
•  The Petroleum and Natural Gas Division will be renamed as the Fuel Resource Development
Division.
•  The Petroleum Refining and Reserve Division and the Petroleum Distribution and Retail Division
will merge and be renamed as the “Fuel Supply Base Building Division” whose role will include
developing a supply chain for SAF and synthetic fuels.
•  The Coal Division and the Mineral and Natural Resources Division will merge and be renamed as

the “Mineral Resources Division”.


Japan might phase out non-fossil certificates by 2030: REI’s Ishida
(Japan NRG, June 27)
•  The non-fossil certificates (NFC) program used to confirm that electricity is produced using
renewable energy sources may be phased out by 2030, according to Ishida Masaya, a senior

manager with the Renewable Energy Institute.
•  As more green energy goes online, the program is losing its purpose, Ishida said, speaking at a
seminar organized by the ACCJ. Also, NFC values are capped at ¥1.3/ kWh, which is half of the
renewables surcharge on household electricity bills, he said. The discrepancy doesn’t make any
sense since they represent the same product.
•  CONTEXT: NFCs are transferred to (corporate) buyers of green electricity as evidence of energy

source. They’re also used in Corporate Power Purchasing Agreements and can play a role in the
negotiations over CPPA pricing. So far, there have been nine virtual PPAs in Japan, with the
biggest two (total 185 MW) involving Murata Manufacturing as buyer and Renova and Mitsubishi as
developers, said Ishida. The next largest has 15.6 MW capacity.

Toshiba and IHI to work on decarbonization of coal-fired stations in Malaysia
(Company statements, June 27-28)
•  Toshiba ESS and IHI both announced that they will work with Malaysia’s TNB Power Generation
(TNB Genco) to decarbonize the latter’s coal-fired power stations. TNB Genco is a subsidiary of

TNB, Malaysia's national utility.
•  Toshiba will work on carbon capture tech and also help train Malaysian engineers to use it. Toshiba
may initially install carbon capture at the Jimah East Power Coal-Fired Power Plant.
•  IHI will run a feasibility study on deploying ammonia and biomass combustion tech at TNB’s
existing thermal power plants, starting with small-scale tests.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Mitsui to develop CCS in Malaysia
(Company statement, June 27)
o  Mitsui, PETRONAS, and TotalEnergies Carbon Neutrality Ventures will develop a CCS
site in Malaysia. The location for CO2 sequestration is offshore Malaysia, benefiting from
its subsurface structure due to previous oil and gas exploration.
o  Malaysia's easy maritime access to major CO2 emitters in Asia makes it an ideal CCS hub
for CO2 storage sites.
o  The collaboration will involve technical assessments and optimization of logistics,

including the transportation of liquefied CO2 and the design of port facilities.
• TAKEAWAY: Many observers, including JOGMEC, believe that ASEAN countries will still rely heavily on fossil
fuels in the future; thus, the search for potential CCS sites has become essential. JOGMEC designated offshore
Malaysia, alongside offshore Sawak and Sabah, as high rating areas for CCS due to their geological features.

• A few weeks ago, JAPEX, JGC Holdings, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha and JFE Steel signed a MoU with PETRONAS
to study the value chain for CCS in Malaysia.



Sumitomo Electric gets first Australian order for vanadium redox flow battery system
(Company statement, June 22)
•  Sumitomo Electric won an order from Vecco Group, an Australian mining company, for a vanadium
redox flow battery system (capacity of 250 kW and 750 kW) and will install the system in
December. It is Sumitomo’s first Australian order for the system.
•  The system will be used as a pilot for Energex in Queensland to assess medium-duration storage

systems and potential for smoothing of solar power output, demand response, etc.
• TAKEAWAY: Veco is an Australian vanadium mine operator part-owned by Idemitsu Kosan. In a way, Vecco
and Sumitomo are competitors. Vecco plans to produce vanadium-electrolytes used in the redox flow
batteries. The electrolytes were first developed by Australian researchers but Sumitomo was able to take the
research and commercialize it.



Power X to import batteries for “battery tanker Power Arc 100”
(Japan NRG, June 27)
•  Power X, a Tokyo-based tech startup that plans to transport power from floating wind power
stations to onshore facilities via a container ship loaded with batteries, plans to import battery cells

due to high domestic costs, said CEO Ito Masahito.

•  Power X plans to launch a “battery tanker Power Arc 100” in 2025. The ship is 8,000 tons and
carries 240 MWh capacity batteries.
•  Japan’s battery manufacturing costs are high and local production can break even only if output is
45 GWh, which is almost three times the country’s total annual demand; With government
subsidies, production could break even at 25 GWh, Ito added.
•  CONTEXT: Ito was speaking at “Project E: Pioneering Energy in DX GX Era”, an online event

hosted by Energy Forum.
• TAKEAWAY: Ito’s remarks raise questions about METI's plan to provide ¥330 billion in subsidies to strengthen
domestic battery production. Japan’s goal is to expand battery storage production capacity from the current
20 GWh to 150 GWh by 2030.



Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and NYK Line get approval for ammonia and LCO2 ship
(Company statement, June 29)
•  Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and NYK Line, both subsidiaries of MHI Group, received Approval in

Principle (AiP) from ClassNK, a Japanese classification society, for a ship capable of transporting
ammonia and liquefied CO2 (LCO2).
•  With the AiP, the two companies will leverage their expertise to ensure the safe and cost-effective
transportation of both ammonia and LCO2 on the same vessel. This would involve transporting
ammonia to thermal power plants on the outbound route and carrying CO2 emitted from the
power plants to storage sites on the return route.
•  Mitsubishi Shipbuilding aims to commercialize ammonia and LCO2 carriers as a marine system

integrator. Meanwhile, NYK Line will continue developing various technologies, including ammonia
and LCO2 carriers.


Success in using liquefied biomethane as marine fuel - Air Water and partners
(Company statement, June 21)
•  Air Water, MOL, MOL Coastal Shipping, Cenergy, IHI Power Systems, and others completed a trial

use of liquefied biomethane (LBM) derived from cattle manure as marine fuel on the domestic
LNG-fueled vessel, Ise Mirai, in Ise Bay, Aichi Pref. This is the first use of carbon-neutral LBM
derived from biomass in Japan.
•  The trial was conducted based on an MoU signed between MOL and Air Water in February;
partners involved are:
o  Shipper: JERA
o  Carrier: Techno Chubu

o  Operator/Shipowner: Kyodou Kaiun (Joint owners: Techno Chubu and MOL Coastal
Shipping)
o  Truck transport: Cenergy
o  Bunkering operator: Cenergy and Kyoudou Kaiun
o  Engine manufacturer: IHI Power Systems
•  The seven companies confirmed that LBM could be transported through the existing domestic

LNG supply chain, truck-to-ship bunkering using existing LNG tank trucks, and LBM to be used as
marine fuel.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: LNG fuels reduce CO2 by 25% compared to conventional bunker oil, but LBM can
reduce it further. Methane is the main component of both LBM and LNG; thus, the existing LNG
supply chains can be used, and LBM can be an effective solution to reduce CO2 from ship
operations. Since Japan’s leading companies in shipping and fueling are involved in this trial, it’s
clear that the adoption of LBM is considered a real possibility for decarbonizing the marine

industry.


















INPEX and Astomos supplied first biofuel bunker to VLGC in the Middle East

(Company statement, June 22)
•  INPEX completed the supply of a B24 biofuel bunker to a very large gas carrier (VLGC), Lycaste
Peace chartered by Astomos Energy at Sharjah port in the UAE. The biofuel was supplied through
the bunker vessel, Monjasa Shaker, operated by Monjasa, one of the world’s top 10 marine fuel
suppliers.
•  B24 biofuel consists of 24% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) produced from waste cooking oil
collected from restaurants and hotels in the UAE. The balance, 76%, consists of very low sulfur fuel

oil (VLSFO), a conventional bunker fuel.


Toyota and Mitsubishi introduce Thailand’s first biogas-derived hydrogen equipment
(Company statement, June 26)
•  Toyota, Toyota Tsusho, and Mitsubishi Kakoki plan to introduce biogas-derived hydrogen
production equipment in Thailand.

•  The equipment, manufactured by Mitsubishi Kakoki, will utilize biogas derived from local chicken
manure and food waste to produce hydrogen. Toyota and Toyota Tsusho will collaborate on

Sagawa and Euglena strike biodiesel deal, asking individuals to pay extra for clean delivery
(Company statement, June 26)
•  Euglena and Sagawa Express, one of Japan’s top logistics companies, have structured a deal in
which the latter will use the former’s biodiesel for some deliveries.
•  Buyers of Euglena consumer products will be able to donate ¥1,000 via its e-commerce website

when they place orders for its cosmetics and supplements. In return, Sagawa will make the delivery
using Euglena’s next-gen biodiesel fuel. The idea is that all parties - the customer, the product
manufacturer, and the distributor - contribute to the cost of moving from fossil to sustainable fuels.
•  The emissions saved through this deal will be certified as a carbon credit certificate from Sagawa
to Euglena.
• TAKEAWAY: Euglena is aiming to promote a new business model that spreads the cost of the energy

transition. A similar approach was trialed by the DHL courier service for its jet fuels, in which customers pay
extra to switch to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). But DHL’s customers are mainly companies, whereas Euglena
is targeting individuals.



Mitsubishi’s rice-paddy methane-reduction project approved for J-Credit Scheme
(Company statement, June 28)
•  Mitsubishi got approval from Japan's J-Credit scheme to register its rice-paddy methane-reduction
project. This extends mid-season drainage, decreasing rice paddy methane emissions, which
account for about 40% of Japan's total.
•  By prolonging drainage periods, methane emissions are reduced by up to 30%.

•  The project aims to monitor and calculate the reduction amounts, offering growers credits that can
be exchanged for monetary compensation. Mitsubishi will collaborate with rice growers
nationwide, hoping to encourage wider participation.



In Brief:

•  Mitsubishi Chemical Group and L&F Korea, a leading supplier of cathode materials for Lithium-ion
batteries (LiB), signed an MoU on supply chains for anode material. Production starts in 2024.
•  LanzaTech and Primetals Technologies (a MHI subsidiary) renewed cooperation for another 10
years to work on “green steel”.
•  MOL and Chevron Singapore signed an MoU to research next-gen fuels that may be used in
marine energy.

•  “K” Line conducted a demo test voyage with the tugboat Aihomaru using next-gen biodiesel fuel
supplied by Toyotsu Energy; the fuel’s made from waste cooking oil.
•  Mitsui and Microwave Chemical (MWCC) will develop a low-carbon lithium ore processing
technology using microwaves, aiming to start commercial production from 2026; the goal is to
create an eco-friendly method for processing lithium.

Round 2 offshore wind tenders worth ¥1 trillion attract heavy bidding
(Nikkei, Japan NRG, June 30)
•  Bids for Round 2 of offshore wind power tenders in Japan closed on June 30. The tenders for four
sites off the Sea of Japan coast should create a combined generation capacity of about 1.8 GW.
The tender value is estimated at over ¥1 trillion.
•  The fixed-bottom offshore wind projects in Nagasaki, Niigata, and Akita attracted 20 companies.

Winners will be decided by late FY2023 (which ends in March 2024).
•  After Round 1 saw a Mitsubishi Corp led consortium sweep the board, tender rules were changed.
So, from this time, each group could bid for no more than 1 GW of capacity if bidding on multiple
sites. The govt also capped bids at ¥19/ kWh, ¥10 lower than in Round 1.
•  CONTEXT: Japan aims to hold auctions for 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030. In 2020,
tenders were held for Round 1. Winners were announced in December 2021. The fact that
Mitsubishi and a unit of Chubu Electric won all three of the main Round 1 auctions prompted an

outcry from competitors. Calls for reform of the system led to lengthy review of the auction rules,
which delayed Round 2.
•  Participants in the current Round 2 tender are:

some expected bidders pull out of the race. While the govt maintains that Japan’s aim is to lower the cost of
offshore wind to about ¥10/ kWh, in other countries inflation in raw materials prices and grid adjustments are
pushing the overall costs up. It is not yet clear how Japanese operators could significantly reduce costs from
the current position. Still, the govt’s support and national net-zero strategies indicate that offshore wind will be

one of the bigger growth energy sectors in the company decades in Japan, which explains the currently strong
industry interest. Businesses will hope that the govt won’t take too long to decide on the results for Round 2
and move expeditiously to Round 3.



Nuclear power plant restarts are delayed
(Nikkei, June 28)
•  Only four of seven NPPs planned for a restart have resumed operations. None are in eastern
Japan, which could lead to a hike in electricity prices in the Tokyo area.
•  The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, which supplies electricity to the Tokyo metropolitan area, is facing

challenges due to a lack of trust from local residents. The NRA is reevaluating TEPCO's
qualification to operate the plant.
•  Additionally, the Tokai Unit 2 NPP has yet to formulate a local evacuation plan.
•  CONTEXT: Japan set a target of increasing the proportion of nuclear power in the country's
energy mix to 20-22% by FY2030. To achieve this goal, about 25 to 28 NPPs would need to be in
operation, with around 15 additional units restarted.
• TAKEAWAY: As Japan NRG detailed in a June 5, 2023 Analysis piece, the much-promised quick restart of

nuclear reactors by PM Kishida has failed to materialize. This is partly because the prime minister was never in
a position to deliver on the promise. He could only state the govt’s desire, but it is up to the NRA, the
regulator, to approve plant restarts and the local authorities to give the final green light. The discrepancy
between PM Kishida’s vows and reality is now starting to be picked up by the mainstream media. How the
public will react is not yet clear. They may see this as a negative in terms of politicians not fulfilling their
promises. Or, the focus could turn to the regulator, putting greater pressure on the NRA to justify the time
they have spent on reviews.



Kyushu Electric explores ammonia/ hydrogen and coal co-firing

(Nikkei, June 29)
•  Kyushu Electric is exploring low-carbon thermal power generation by mixing and burning ammonia
or hydrogen with coal or LNG.
•  The company’s coal/ ammonia co-firing test was a success, but the mixing ratio was only 0.1%. The
amount of ammonia mixed was 300 kg for about 300 tons of coal.
•  The aim is to increase the ammonia ratio to 20% by 2030 while addressing technical and cost
issues. Kyushu Electric plans to rely on imports of the clean fuels and will explore joint procurement

and storage options with other power companies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Offshore wind: Daido Metal invests ¥6 billion for new turbine bearing facility in Czechia

(New Energy Business, June 26)
•  Daido Metal will supply power-generating turbine bearings for offshore wind in the EU. It will
invest ¥6 billion to build a factory to make several hundred systems a year.
•  It will be located on the site of Daido Metal Czechia, in the Czech Republic, and start production in
2025.
•  Daido’s bearings support rotating shafts of steam and gas turbines and power generators that

reduce noise and vibration, saving energy.

JEPX to gradually lift ban on resale of wholesale power purchases
(Denki Shimbun, June 28)
•  JEPX will gradually lift the ban on the resale of wholesale power.
•  Some wholesale trades are subject to conditions such as a ban on resale, restrictions on the
amount of electricity that can be purchased and tendered, and restrictions on supplying electricity

outside the area in which it was purchased.
•  Govt officials have determined that this approach can hinder competition and prevent companies
from developing more flexible purchasing strategies.
•  Also, the idea is to create a fairer landscape for domestic and foreign retail electricity providers
and more market transparency.


TEPCO PG to control transmission line overloads with new relay

(Denki Shimbun, June 28)
•  TEPCO Power Grid (PG) is Japan’s first company to introduce a device that uses sensors to control
overloads in the middle of a transmission line.
•  A sensor transmission type overload protection relay (OLR) was installed on a 66,000 V
transmission line in Moka City, Tochigi Pref, and began operation.
•  As more solar capacity is rolled out, there’s a risk that the intermediate section of the transmission

line will overload. Finding smart solutions is important since wholesale work to reinforce
transmission lines would cost several billion yen.

Calls for Climate Action Reverberate at Japan’s AGMs

Many say that the rainy season in June makes them sleepy. But in the corporate
calendar, June is no time to relax because it’s when over 2,000 Japanese listed firms
host their annual general meeting (AGM). What’s made the month particularly stormy
of late is the rising number of shareholder resolutions put to management. Climate
issues feature prominently among them.

This AGM season saw a record 90 shareholder resolutions filed, with more than 10%
climate related. Activists demanded changes to company charters to reflect climate
ambitions aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. There were calls for an exit from
financing or investing in coal; and there were several demands for more disclosure.

Japan’s original climate activist shareholders were non-profit organizations or their
staff. In recent years, however, European institutional investors have joined the
movement, supporting and sometimes even initiating shareholder demands.

The campaigns generally receive strong media coverage, partly helped by the fact
that most of the resolutions are tabled against blue chip companies and some of
Japan’s most famous brands. This year, even Toyota Motor came under the spotlight.
But how much impact are climate activists having on corporate decisions in Japan?


2020-2022 climate resolutions attract unexpected support
In Japan, the climate resolution boom took off in 2020 when a Mizuho Financial
Group individual shareholder, who was also a member of activist group Kiko Network,
filed a first-ever climate resolution. The activist demanded Mizuho to include Paris
Agreement commitments to the Articles of Incorporation. Proxy advisory firms Glass
Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services were in support, and it won 34.5% of the
votes, thanks to backing from Nordea Asset Management, Sweden’s AP7, Denmark’s
AkademikerPension, and Allianz Global Investors among others.

In 2021, the Australian climate activist group Market Forces joined the movement,
filing similar resolutions to trading house Sumitomo Corp, while Kiko Network filed
resolutions to Mitsubishi UFJ Group. Glass Lewis and ISS were not supportive this
time, but Japanese asset management funds were. The resolutions secured
shareholder support rates of 20% and 23%, respectively. Separately, European funds
filed similar resolutions to J-Power and saw 26% backing.

While the resolutions came up short of a majority and did not pass, they sent shock
waves across financial markets. In Japan, shareholder resolutions – activist driven or
not – rarely won over 20% of the vote. There are no legally binding rules on
shareholder voting in Japan. They are left to the discretion of the company and its
shareholders, resulting in some rules that are not fair to minority shareholders. For
example, blank votes are automatically counted as votes in favor of the management.

Traditionally, so many AGMs are held in such a short time that each one is expected
to be short and sweet. On June 29 alone almost 600 companies held their
shareholders’ meeting.

Resolutions add to the AGM agenda and make it more eventful. They are also a new
trend for many Japanese retail investors. In one 2023 AGM, management needed to
explain shareholder rights to a confused individual, who asked the assembly why she
was receiving resolution proposals from two parties.

This year, four climate activists filed resolutions to three banks, one trading house and
two power utilities; and European funds filed to J-Power. The AGMs were held from
June 23 to 29. None passed. J-Power said the funds’ two resolutions got 15% and
21% of the votes, down from last year. The exact support percentage and other
details of the other resolution votes were not immediately available.

Impact on corporate decisions
Overseas, energy firms have been grappling with environmental activists and activist
investors pushing for more climate action for a lot longer. Some have found that the
best defense, from their point of view, was better and more communication with
various stakeholders.

For example, Australia’s biggest oil and gas producer, Woodside Energy, has
unsurprisingly faced withering attacks from activists, which say the company is
delaying a shift away from fossil energy. In response, Woodside said it has conducted
about 60 investor engagements on climate and governance issues.

In Japan, which has relatively small oil and gas firms compared to global majors,
climate activists have primarily targeted businesses with a high exposure to coal-fired
power generation. Like Woodside, many Japanese firms found that they need to be
more vocal and engaging. Several targeted company officials told Japan NRG that
activist campaigns led them to change their communication strategies and
stakeholder engagement.

“We were influenced because thanks to them, we became highly aware of the need to
communicate our side of the climate story,” said an official from a Japanese energy
company. However, he noted that changes in his company’s business strategies -- to
make a partial shift away from fossil fuel – were influenced by government policy and
market forces.

In short, Japanese firms feel that the core drivers of their business are state policy, as
well as via regulatory and market trends. Taking orders on strategy from activists is not
on their agenda, and in some cases, it’s not even considered feasible.

Take early closure of coal-fired power plants, as an example. Owing to concerns about
capacity shortages and energy security, last year the government introduced rules that

prevent utilities from decommissioning thermal power plants unless they get express
approval from METI. The rationale is that the ministry needs to be consulted and on
the lookout for potential gaps in energy supplies.

Furthermore, company executives in Japan doubt that the demands of a vocal
minority for significant changes in corporate strategies would win approval from the
majority of the shareholders. After all, institutional investors also have a fiduciary duty
to extract the best possible returns from a business.

Activists themselves partly admit that their goals may not meet with majority approval.
Kiko Network’s resolution vote analysis showed that while support for its demands for
more disclosure was generally high, most shareholders were not strongly in favor of
pushing companies to alter their business strategies.

Since climate activists in their essence are single-issue focused, they are seen by
target company officials as having a narrow perspective. What’s more, officials claim
that the activists are inconsistent in their demands, simply aligning their focus with the
most recent trends in climate discourse and dismissing a more integrated approach to
the energy transition.

“Power utilities can’t change strategies every year like activists,” said one executive.


Antitrust not a concern
One area in Japan’s power sector that climate activists have not discussed hardly at all
is competition. A fair and competitive playing field is essential for spurring the growth
of new clean energy supplies, and it won’t be possible to phase out fossil fuel
generation without robust renewables market players.

Earlier this year, some of Japan’s biggest power utilities were accused by antitrust
officials of cartel behavior. What’s worse, it was discovered that the grid units of the
utilities, which are supposed to run the electricity transmissions network in a neutral
manner that’s open to all market players, passed information about competitors to the
utilities’ retail divisions. That directly affected some renewables operators.

When asked about this, however, activists including Market Forces say they are not
interested in the cartel issue. Bernadette Maheandiran, Asia director of Market Forces,
said the organization has no position on the cartel issues. Meanwhile, Kiko Network
recognizes the importance of the cartel incident, and said it will continue
engagements with Chubu Electric, one of the firms accused of anticompetitive
behavior by government officials.


What’s next?
Climate activists have made more headway in Japan in the climate tech startups scene
and with ESG consultancies. There is also a widely held belief in such circles that the
government’s introduction of the GX Promotion Act, which took effect June 30, will
help activists persuade companies that climate engagement cannot be separated
from business strategy any longer.
Even so, the activists may need to tweak their approach. Pushing for a change in the
corporate charter is unlikely to yield results. Japan NRG surveyed major business
federations and found that, as of today, there does not appear to be any major

Hydroelectric Power: Japan Has to Stop Going with the Flow

As Japan accelerates its energy transition, the country will have to tap into every
possible renewable energy resource in order to fully replace fossil fuels and end their
use by 2050. Hydropower is an area that has seen nearly flat growth in recent
decades. But the potential is there, if the government is willing to commit the
resource and partner with the private sector.

Japan is the world's sixth largest producer of hydropower, but most such plants are
pumped-storage plants. Conventional hydropower plants account for roughly 20 GW
out of the total installed hydro capacity of 50 GW.

Even though hydro is Japan’s second most important renewable energy source after
solar energy, it’s often overlooked in renewable energy discussions and plans. The
main obstacle is cost and return on investment. Hydropower plants require proximity
to rivers that are often located in remote, mountainous regions. This in turn often
leads to higher than usual transmission losses.

Unlike the U.S., Brazil and Russia, all of which have many large rivers, and hence,
large-scale hydropower facilities, in Japan the rivers tend to be much smaller. This
brings in problems related to the cost of scale for hydro plants. Japan has many small
and micro hydro installations, with some offering just 30-40 kW of capacity.

Additionally, environmental concerns over large dam projects have been a factor
limiting hydro’s development. Altogether, these factors have put a brake on the
expansion of generation from large hydropower sources. Still, amply endowed with
mountainous terrain and flowing rivers, Japan would be making a mistake not to find
ways to further tap into this clean energy source.


Obstacles to development
During the early Showa period, from 1930 to 1950, hydro played a vital role in the
expansion of Japan's electricity generation. By the late 1960s, however, that growth
began to slow in the face of limited suitable locations for large dam construction.

Today, the size classification references the Feed-in Tariff system. Large hydro is
anything above 30 MW of capacity; medium is within a range of 1 MW to 30 MW; and
small is anything under 1 MW. Pumped-storage hydropower is regarded as a separate
category, while micro-hydro facilities refer to systems within the 5-100 kW range.

The primary obstacles for hydro development include high costs, stringent
government regulation and community opposition. First and foremost, the
construction and maintenance costs, including sediment removal and forest
reclamation, are significant.

Furthermore, the concept of ‘back allocation’, where construction costs are
retroactively borne by those benefiting from the facility, poses a challenge for hydro

developers, as it can significantly reduce potential profits from power generation and
sales.

Additionally, utilizing existing multipurpose dams for hydro can face opposition from
nearby residents. Increasing water storage for electricity production may require
releasing stored water during typhoons or heavy rain, potentially causing downstream
flooding. Repurposing multipurpose dams for power generation is also difficult due to
current laws, which stipulate that their use should be determined at the construction
stage.

Potential of small and mid-sized hydro
In total, by 2035 hydropower generation is anticipated to grow by 5%. However, when
this is broken down by size, capacity and type, there’s a very different picture. The
forecast for large hydro capacity is negligible growth. Pumped hydro, however, is
projected to grow by 9%. The problem is that building large hydro facilities can take
decades from project phase to full operation. For example, construction of Japan’s
largest hydro projects began in the late '20s/early '30s and were completed only after
WWII.

Meanwhile, a 2019 report by the MoE indicated that small and mid-sized hydroelectric
power plants have the potential to more than double installed capacity (now between
3.2 and 4.1 GW). However, it will be necessary to grapple with high construction
costs, securing investment in an increasingly competitive capital market for renewable
energy projects, and community approval.

Estimated costs for mid-sized hydroelectric power plants are comparable to coal-fired,
LNG-fired and nuclear stations. Small-scale hydropower costs are much higher in
terms of ¥/kWh partly because maintenance costs are about four times higher than for
larger facilities, says METI. In addition, there are cost challenges in integrating small
hydro into the grid.

One solution for new hydro facilities is to apply for a FIT license and, in the future, the
Feed-in Premium (FIP) program.

Pumped-storage hydro: a viable solution
Pumped-storage hydropower, which stores and generates electricity using reservoirs
at different elevations, has emerged as a valuable energy storage system in Japan,
which ranks second globally in pure pumped hydro capacity, with 21.9 GW.

Initially developed to “store” surplus power from nuclear and thermal sources by
using excess electricity to move water to a higher elevation, pumped hydro can now
also be applied for solar.

As renewable energy gains traction, pumped-storage hydro is an increasingly vital
energy storage system, helping to balance the intermittent nature of renewable
sources like solar and wind. This function will continue to make it an attractive option
for Japan's energy sector.


Case studies: success stories and innovations
In Tochigi Prefecture, the Momura Power Plant, with its Units 1-2 (120 kW total),
utilizes the elevation of an agricultural canal to generate electricity. Along with
technologies like spiral water turbines and pressure reducing valves, this project
demonstrates the potential for further growth in small and mid-sized hydropower
generation. Water sources such as agricultural water, surplus from dams, and water
supply and sewerage systems, can then be used.

One example is Gokase, a small town in Kyushu, which established the Gokase
Research Institute of Renewable Energy (GRIRE) to promote renewables. With
community involvement, from 2013 to 2019 they installed over 10 micro-hydro plants,
ranging from 1 kW to 200 kW each. They also sold the electricity through the FIT
program.

The Tagokura Power Station (400 MW) in Fukushima Prefecture has been generating
hydropower since 1959. After the incident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP in 2011, the

local prefecture decided to expand its hydropower facilities. Currently, with 11 dams
and 14 power plants built in close proximity to the Tagokura Dam, this area has
become a major hydro hub in the prefecture.

In 2015, Hinohara Hydroelectric set up a subsidiary, Suikoten, which is the first small
hydro plant in Tokyo. It utilizes the natural drop (91 meters) of a river. With help from
the state the company obtained water rights that paved the way for future hydro
projects. The company sells electricity through the FIT program.


Future outlook and challenges
While the MoE predicts growth by 2050 in the small and medium-sized hydropower
sector, which is forecasted at a 1.5-fold rise, there are reasons for skepticism. Unless
the national government acts and offers financial support, many existing and potential
plans will struggle to succeed. Integrating electricity from small hydro into the grid is
one of the main obstacles due to the small volumes involved and high maintenance
costs.

While companies may be interested in hydro, low production volume and remote
locations with challenging grid connections mean that such investments won’t be
profitable any time soon. This is especially true for run-of-river or irrigation channel
projects, which lack storage capabilities.

On the contrary, pumped hydro solutions are gaining interest due to their ability to
address intermittency issues.

Small hydro facilities can be a solution for small communities when state support is
available. Many such projects benefit from FIT and there is a lot more potential for the
sector via this funding mechanism than from solar. While solar PV capacity grew from
13.6 GW to 78.8 GW in the 2013-2022 period, hydro stayed almost flat, moving from
48.9 GW to 50 GW in the same period.

Further advantages could come under the FIP program. To maximize the effectiveness
of such a program, which means managing the supply of weather-dependent solar
and wind power generation, the use of storage batteries and other adjustment
equipment will play an important role.

Hydro offers a relatively stable supply capacity and the ability to adjust output based
on demand. Consequently, it becomes possible to sell electricity during periods of
high demand and favorable market prices, making small hydropower a great fit for the
FIP system.

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Green hydrogen
Australia green-lit building a A$51 million renewable hydrogen plant in Victoria state.
The 10 MW electrolyzer to be built in Wodonga in Victoria will be bigger than any
current such unit in Australia.

Australia/ Nuclear power
BHP Group wants Australia to lift its ban on nuclear energy. Laura Tyler, the
company’s CTO, said: “To make sure we have that safe, reliable energy mix, we need
to be able to mix it up… by partnering nuclear with wind, solar, batteries and other
sources of electricity.”

China/ LNG
China’s ENN will buy 1.8 million tons annually of LNG from Cheniere on a free-on-
board basis for a purchase price indexed to Henry Hub, plus a fixed liquefaction fee.
Deliveries begin in mid-2026. The agreement extends to 2050.

Italy/ Oil
Eni will acquire UK-based Neptune Energy for $4.9 billion, the largest cash deal in the
EU oil and gas sector in a decade. Eni will acquire Neptune for $2.6 billion, while Vår
Energi, Eni’s Norwegian subsidiary, will acquire Neptune’s operations in Norway for
$2.3 billion.
Italy/ Wind power
In a revision of the country's energy and climate strategy, Italy plans to get 65% of its
electricity from renewables by 2030, up from a previous target of 55%. Also, hydrogen
will power 42% of industrial needs by 2030.

Mongolia/ Critical minerals
The U.S. and Mongolia plan to work together on critical minerals. The countries
signed a MoU on June 27, 2023, to jointly advance secure and resilient critical mineral
supply chains in the Indo-Pacific region.

Natural gas
Companies such as Shell and Chevron will invest more in natural gas, as Chinese and
EU importers sign long-term LNG deals. Shell's CEO Wael Sawan said: “LNG can be
easily transported to where it’s needed most. On average, natural gas emits about
50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to produce electricity.”

Norway/ Oil and gas
Norway approved oil and gas projects worth $18.5 billion. The 19 projects include
new developments, additional development of producing oil and gas fields, and
investments to increase resource recovery in producing fields.

Renewable energy
Global energy demand rose 1% last year, slowing from 5.5% in 2021. Record
renewables growth was unable to challenge fossil fuels, which accounted for 82% of
supply, according to Statistical Review of World Energy. Last year saw the largest ever
increase in renewables capacity, for a total 266 GW; solar led the growth.

Wind power
Siemens Energy shares continue to fall, hit by target price cuts and rating downgrades
in the wake of problems at its wind turbine division. The group's loss in market
valuation is about €7.4 billion.

U.S./ Gas plants
Gas plant capacity is booming, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. Nearly 4.47 GW of natural gas-fired generation came online in the first
four months this year, up from 0.55 GW in the same period in 2022.
