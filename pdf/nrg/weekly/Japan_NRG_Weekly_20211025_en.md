NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Cabinet approved Basic Energy Plan and emissions cuts strategy ahead of COP26

•  The Cabinet convened for a special meeting despite the disbanding of parliament ahead of the
Oct. 31 general election to approve the draft 6th Basic Energy Plan and also the Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) that Japan will make toward cutting its emissions.
•  The Cabinet decision came just ahead of Japan’s participation in a G7 Trade Ministers meeting
(Oct. 22), the G20 Rome Summit (Oct. 30-21), and COP26 Climate Summit (Oct. 31 to Nov. 12).
•  As expected, the Plan was passed seemingly without any major changes. That means the role of

renewables is increased to 36-38% of the power mix by FY2030; nuclear keeps its share; fossil fuels
will need to be scaled back by half; and, ammonia or hydrogen will enter the mix for the first time.
•  To many, this power mix means Japan will have to rely heavily on a big capacity boost from solar
power over the rest of the decade while also making a push to restart as many reactors as it can.
•  The Cabinet’s approval of the NDC document means that the emissions cuts previously announced
by then Prime Minister Suga will also remain. The country will seek to reduce CO2 levels 46% by
FY2030 compared with FY2013.
•  As expected, the NDC plan shows that JCM (Joint Crediting Mechanism) will play a significant role

in helping Japan reach its target. This effectively means that as much as a quarter of Japan’s CO2
reductions will come from projects completed by Japanese firms in countries other than Japan.
•  Major reductions are also seen for Japan’s housing sector, especially in residential buildings.
•  Japan NRG will discuss some of these issues around the NDCs and emissions on this Thursday’s
webinar: “COP26: Preview and Expectations”.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The Methanation Council of Government and the Private Sector will set up a task force to measure
carbon impact of fuel re-produced from carbon. The 30 Council members is comprised of
academics, state ministry officials, and experts from energy, power, automotive, trading,
steelmaking, shipping and shipbuilding companies. The council is headed by professor Hirotaka
Yamauchi of Hitotsubashi University.

•  The carbon from recycled carbon fuel should be recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel of
Climate Change (IPCC) inventory, and establishing measurement methodologies is required, the
Council said. The Carbon Capture and Reuse Study Group estimates that carbon emissions from
liquefied recycled carbon, or methanation, used as ship fuel, were 27 grams CO2/ MJ, compared
to 90g/ MJ for liquefied hydrogen derived from fossil fuel, 85 g/ MJ for high-sulfur fuel oil, and
20g/ MJ for biogas.

CARBON   EMISSIONS  OF  SHIPPING  FUELS

Fossil-fuel derived liquefied hydrogen          90

High-sulfur fuel oil                 85

Liquefied recycled carbon, or methanation 27
Biogas   20

GRAMS OF CO2/MJ 0   23      45      68      90     113
SOURCE: CARBON CAPTURE AND REUSE STUDY GROUP
• TAKEAWAY: This will be a world first — measuring the carbon emission of recycled carbon fuel, a METI official
told Japan NRG. Policymakers abroad, however, are skeptical about the potential of recycled carbon,
compared to hydrogen, which is seen as the more promising green source of energy, the official said.




Green Innovation Fund WG drafts roadmaps for recycled carbon fuel development
(Japan NRG, Oct. 21)
•  A Green Innovation Fund working group drafted roadmaps for developing synthetic fuel,

sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), synthetic methane and green LPG to achieve 2050 carbon neutrality
goal, METI said on Oct. 21.
•  Synthetic fuel combines CO2 with green hydrogen, and is suited for commercial and aviation
vehicles that require high energy volumes. The goals are to establish manufacturing technologies
to realize 55 kg carbon/km efficiency, to run 500 barrels/day pilot plant by 2030 and to
commercialize it by 2040.
•  There will possibly be various SAFs using available local resources such as ethanol and biomass.

The aim is by 2030 to fly planes fueled by SAF at a cost of ¥100/ liter.
•  Synthetic methane is a promising source of heat required by industrial plants. Pilot methanation
plants have started to run and breakthrough processes should be established by 2030. It will be
commercialized by 2040.
•  The blue and green hydrogen plants could be leveraged to produce green LP gas. Construction
will commence in 2025-2028, and the goal is to produce 1,000 ton/ year of green LP gas by 2030.

METI opens Green Innovation Fund applications for developing CCU cement, concrete
(Japan NRG, Oct. 15)
•  On Oct. 15, METI began accepting Green Innovation Fund applications to develop carbon capture
and utilization technologies for concrete and cement production.

•  The government will provide up to ¥35.94 billion for emission cuts and new materials that can fix
carbon, reduce cost of CCU concrete production, establish methods to measure carbon fixation
and standardize them. It will also provide ¥20.84 billion to capture all CO2 generated from calcium
carbonate used in the cement production process and reuse the captured carbon as carbonate.
•  Applications close on Nov. 29 and the results will be announced in January.



METI panel drafts green technology roadmaps for steel, petrochemical sectors

(Japan NRG, Oct. 15)
•  A METI study group on industry roadmaps to promote transition finance has drafted technology
roadmaps toward full carbon neutrality for the steel and petrochemical sectors. The roadmap
milestones comply with Paris Agreement goals, and is intended as guides for the financial sector
that engage with heavy emitters.
•  The roadmaps also identify technology options the companies can take for the short and medium

terms before reaching full neutrality in 2050. The panel is drawing the roadmaps for the two
sectors, as well as for power, gas, oil, cement and paper manufacturing.
•  Major transition technologies for the steel sector include developing a new iron reducing agent
called ferro-coke, made from low-grade iron ore and coal, capturing and separating gases in the
blast furnaces and recycling them, establishing hydrogen steel manufacturing process, and
removing impurity from low-grade scrap electrically.
•  The petrochemical technology evolutions include upgrades in the naphtha crackers to decarbonize

the heat sources and the reuse the gases released.
•  By March 2022, the study group will release roadmaps for the five other sectors.
•  CONTEXT: Ferro-coke will replace coke made of coal only by 30%. A mixture of 30% ferro-coke
and 70% coking coal is expected to cut emissions in the ironmaking process by 10%. Over half of
800 billion tons of iron ore deposits worldwide are low grade ores of less than 50% iron. Standard
steel-grade iron ore contains 58-62% iron. Steelmakers have developed technologies that make

use of the low-grade resources, mostly as a cheaper source of pig iron rather than an iron
reduction agent.

Corporations agree to disclose emissions figures
(Nikkei, Oct. 15)
•  A group of 50 companies including Toshiba, Sony, and, notably, ANA, agreed to share information
on CO2 emissions as part of a scheme to enable corporations to quantify the total carbon

emissions associated with goods and services provided, taking into account all supply chain stages.
•  The companies established the ‘Green Digital Consortium’, whose membership also includes the
likes of Amazon Web Services Japan and major construction company Takenaka.
•  The consortium will be administered by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology
Industries Association.



Mitsubishi to invest ¥2 trillion in emissions reductions

(New Energy Business News, Oct. 19)
•  Mitsubishi Corporation released its investment policy for energy transition.
•  In addition to zero-net GHG emissions by 2050, the policy includes a new goal for the company’s
emissions to fall to half of 2020 levels by 2030.
•  To achieve this, Mitsubishi will divest from some thermal power generation, convert other thermal
power plants to hydrogen or ammonia cofiring, transition its mining, manufacturing, and logistical

operations to renewable energy, establish virtual power plants, and optimize its supply chain.
•  The corporation’s Power Solution Group will invest heavily in data and AI-based solutions for
optimizing electricity supply and demand. Mitsubishi is expecting demand for these services to
grow significantly in coming years.
•  CONTEXT: The trading house is one of Japan’s biggest companies and has a huge influence on
the energy and commodity, as well as power markets. Furthermore, it’s investment amount is the
same as the size of the government’s Green Innovation Fund.




ANA starts offering companies certificates to show their travel is low-carbon via SAF
(New Energy Business News, Oct. 18)
•  All Nippon Airways (ANA) said it will start to offer companies certificates to show that their business
travel is not contributing to emissions through the rollout of a special low-carbon fuel program.
•  The “SAF Flight Initiative: For the Next Generation" aims to reduce CO2 emissions in air

transportation through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Companies will be able to sign a
contract with ANA to show that the fuel used for their cargo transport or employee business trips
was low carbon. The premiums from such contracts will support ANA in its efforts to decarbonize
operations and expand the production and use of SAF across industries.
•  The certificates will come from a third-party organization.
•  Also, companies that sign on for the program will be listed in ANA media as a SAF Flight Initiative
partner, and will be provided with a corporate symbol and other materials to show that they are

promoting efforts to reduce CO2 emissions through the use of SAF.
•  The initiative is meant to substantially reduce CO2 emissions from employee business trips and
cargo deliveries. So far, Nippon Express, Kintetsu Express, and Yusen Logistics have announced
their participation in the program.

Tokio Marine to help companies analyze decarbonization costs

(Asia Nikkei, Oct. 19)
•  As early as FY2022, Tokio Marine and Nichido Fire Insurance will launch a service that calculates
the financial risks companies could face from environmental regulations abroad, helping
businesses better plan their strategies to fight climate change.
•  While there already are services that predict losses from floods and other natural disasters
triggered by climate change, one that accounts for government regulation is rare.
•  The Japanese insurer will partner with Risilience, a British risk assessment firm specializing in

climate change, on the endeavor.
•  Clients will be able to instantaneously ascertain the potential financial hit from building a new
factory or office in a particular country or region by plugging in factors like output capacity, floor
space and suppliers. The model will account for changes in specific local policies, like a new
carbon tax or an end to fossil fuel subsidies.
•  In addition, the service can also predict how environmental boycotts and other issues could
squeeze sales.

(Kankyo Business, Oct. 18)
•  INPEX and Osaka Gas will build one of the world’s largest methanation plants in a proof of concept
study.
•  The project was commissioned by NEDO.
•  The plant will be able to synthesize 400 normal cubic meters of methane per hour using
renewably-generated electricity.
•  The required CO2 will be sourced from the Minami-Nagaoka gas field. Methane synthesized will

supplement natural gas produced at INPEX’s Koshijihara Gas Plant.
•  The parties plan to upscale to a 60,000 N㎥/h commercial operation.



Oji Paper pioneers biofuel-fired coking furnace
(New Energy Business News, Oct. 20)
•  Oji Paper successfully converted a coking furnace in its Mishima factory to run on a blend of

biogas, natural gas, and fuel oil.
•  The conversion reduces annual fuel oil consumption by 40%, lowering annual CO2 emissions by
over 30,000 tons.
•  The biogas is generated by the anaerobic fermentation of byproducts from kraft pulp production in
a “Bioimpact” system supplied by Sumitomo Heavy Industries Environment.




Takuma and Nippon Paper collaborate on carbon capture
(New Energy Business News, Oct. 18)
•  Waste management specialist Takuma and Nippon Paper were tapped by NEDO to investigate the
potential of carbon capture (CC) utilization and storage systems for biomass fueled generation

plants.
•  The trial will draw on Takuma’s expertise in refuse incineration and biomass power generation.
•  Typically, CC plants have an absorption tower and a regeneration tower.
•  CO2 recovered can be used to manufacture cement or syngas, sold in liquid form to industry, or
sent to underground storage.



Coal addiction could be the undoing of Japan’s manufacturers

(Diamond, Oct. 21)
•  Many major manufacturers, including Nippon Paper and Nippon Steel, operate their own coal-fired
power plants, on which they are heavily reliant.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  In fact, it was not electricity generators but the steelmaking, papermaking, and chemical industries
that took the greatest umbrage to the government’s announcement to phase out inefficient coal-
fired power stations by 2030.
•  If Nippon Steel is forced to shut down the inefficient coal-fired power stations that provide over
90% of its electricity needs, it will have to purchase an estimated 27 TW hours on the market,

which at current market prices represent an annual cost of over ¥500 billion. This absolutely dwarfs
and wipes out Nippon Steel’s ¥11 billion annual profit.
•  Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui & Co, and Tokyo Gas are among those trying to win a piece of the
market to decarbonize Japan’s manufacturing sector, and are expected to exploit the sector’s
current woes.
•  Among options for operators of coal-fired power stations trying to reduce their carbon footprint

are biomass cofiring, a relatively cost inefficient option, and the replacement of existing power
stations with LNG fired stations that offer lower running costs but requires enormous capital
investment.



How do Japan’s largest corporations score on ESG goals?
(Toyo Keizai, Oct. 18)
•  For the fourth year running, insurance giant Sompo Holdings topped a list of 200 major

corporations ranked by performance against environmental, social, and corporate governance
(ESG) goals.
•  Sompo Holdings worries that it’s exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings more
natural disasters and thus, higher costs for insurers.
•  Omron, J. Front Retailing, Fuji Film Holdings and KDDI also ranked highly.
•  Japan Exchange Group and Tobu Railway both received low scores.




Low-carbon hell: the companies left behind in the race to decarbonize
(Diamond, Oct. 20)
•  We ranked 100 top Japanese corporations in terms of ability to compete in a low-carbon

Why Toyota won’t give up on fuel cells
(President, Oct. 21)

10


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  While the rest of the automotive industry turns its attention to EVs, Toyota stubbornly pursues
hydrogen-fueled fuel-cell vehicles such as its Mirai.
•  Hydrogen remains expensive. While the Nissan Leaf reports fuel costs around ¥2/ km, for the Mirai
it’s nearly ¥9 — not much less than a gasoline-powered vehicle.
•  With filling stations still few and far between, and the price of hydrogen fuel around ¥1100/ kg,

many believe hydrogen vehicles will die out as EVs become more dominant.
•  One major advantage of hydrogen vehicles, however, is their long-range compared to EVs. Trucks
and buses are good candidates for hydrogen as they operate on set routes, making the scarcity of
filling stations less of an issue.
•  Toyota launched a hydrogen bus model in 2018.

Japan says LNG stocks adequate for winter, but warns utilities against complacency
(Japan NRG, Oct. 21)
•  METI asked power and gas suppliers, as well as upstream companies and trading houses that
import LNG, to be certain there’s sufficient LNG supplies on hand to safeguard against power
plant incidents, and to share supplies in cases of emergencies.
•  As of mid-October, the LNG stocks of power companies stood at a five-year high of 2.3 million

tons, up 0.7 million tons from a year ago.
•  Speaking at a government and industry meeting, energy agency commissioner Hosaka said that
with the current level of LNG inventories Japan should be able to avoid a tight supply-demand
situation even if the weather turns colder than usual, “as long as the companies continue to
procure as planned”.
•  Hosaka warned, however, that there is still a possibility that the supply and demand of electricity
will become more severe due to an unexpected increase in demand or a large-scale power supply

problem.
•  The meeting was held for the first time to ensure a stable energy supply for this winter. From the
private sector, participants included Ikebe, Chairman of the Federation of Electric Power
Companies of Japan (FEPC); Onoda, President of JERA, Morimoto, President of Kansai Electric.
•  FEPC’s Ikebe expressed his view on the recent rise in the spot price of LNG, saying, "each electric
power company procures LNG mainly through long-term contracts, so there is no prospect of a

fuel shortage at least at this point.”
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI warns LNG supply will tighten in seven years without new projects
(Japan NRG and Denki Shimbun, Oct. 22)
o  Over the longer term, METI forecasts a potential LNG shortage beyond 2028 as the
number of new gas fields starts to decline in 2026. Serious energy panics, comparable to
last winter, are possible.

o  METI was citing a study by Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC),
that says if no final investment decisions (FID) are made for new LNG projects in the near
future the market will be much tighter after 2028.
o  Nishizawa, Managing Executive Officer and CEO of Mitsubishi Corporation's Natural Gas
Group, said at the industry meeting: "The more we rush to become carbon neutral, the
more LNG demand will increase in the short to medium term. At the same time, we are

under strong pressure to decarbonize, and upstream investment is becoming
challenging."
o  Nishizawa called on the government to provide the public and the international
community with appropriate information on the situation.

(Denki Shimbun, Oct. 21)
•  Kansai Electric will build a liquefied carbon dioxide (CO2) shipping terminal at its Maizuru Power
Plant (coal, 900 MW x 2 units). Japan CCS, the nation’s public-private carbon capture research

entity, will be a partner in the project.
•  The power utility plans to use an absorbent to carry out a CO2 capture test at its coal power plant.
The ¥16 billion project, which is also backed by NEDO, will also involve the development of a CO2
liquefaction and storage system suitable for long-distance, mass transportation, including by ship.
•  About 10,000 tons of CO2 per year will be transported by ship to a CO2 storage site at
Tomakomai City, Hokkaido.
•  The consortium of Japanese companies, as well as state entities like NEDO, will run the project for

six years, until FY2016, and use the experience to advance the practical application of the carbon
capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) system.
•  CONTEXT: Kansai Electric has worked for years with large engineering firms in Japan to jointly
develop solid absorbents for CO2. It is currently involved with Kawasaki Heavy Industries and the
Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) to test solid absorbent materials
that could be economically viable for CO2 recovery tech.

• TAKEAWAY: For major power utilities and the government, this is probably one of the most important R&D
projects. It’s no secret that many in the Japanese power sector would like to continue running thermal power
plants instead of exiting the space for new energy alternatives. How many coal-fired plants Japan will have 10
to 20 years from now is still uncertain, but as Japan NRG reported in the Aug. 10, 2021 issue, capacity is still
growing and is expected to hit 55.4 GW by FY2024. Thus, the demonstration at Maizuru station is very
important for utilities and METI officials, who want to make CCUS commercially viable.

• For a more detailed look at Japan CCS and the Tomakomai CCS project, see the Feb. 8 issue.

ANALYSIS

BY CHISAKI WATANABE


Raw Materials Price Inflation
Threatens to Dampen Japan’s New Renewables Focus

Japan’s effort to boost renewables capacity over the course of this decade is falling
prey to inflation. Energy and commodity prices have surged this year on the back of
spending by many governments to alleviate the effects of the pandemic, as well
logistical bottlenecks and power shortages.

The rise in raw materials prices is starting to filter into the cost of solar in Japan after a
substantial jump in panel prices recently, according to government officials that
oversee renewable energy development. Solar polysilicon prices jumped to the
highest in a decade last week.

The increase comes at a time when solar development in Japan is at a crossroad. The
government’s latest energy vision places a big bet on solar power in part due to its
short installation time and a record of falling costs over the prior decade. But central
government plans have bumped against increasing local opposition, that, among
other factors, centers on perceived space constraints.

Evidence of rising costs for solar and wind developments is also a political concern.
Newly anointed Prime Minister Kishida Fumio is leading the ruling party to a general
election on Oct. 31 with promises that include a greater eye on affordability and
wealth redistribution.

Global chain of events
Following the recent announcement by Idemitsu’s Solar Frontier subsidiary that it will
cease to make solar panels there are few domestic manufacturers left to sound the
alarm. But, the rise in costs has not gone unnoticed by the government.

| Threatens to Dampen Japan’s New Renewables Focus |

"Solar panel prices (in Japan) are up by 10% to 30% due to a shortage of
semiconductors and an increase in the costs of polysilicon and others," a METI official
told a task force meeting on renewable energy in September. “We will closely monitor
the situation to see if this is a long-term trend or just temporary.”

After years of falling PV module costs, the outlook is uncertain. To be sure, rising
material prices are not a Japan-only problem. This casts a shadow on solar and wind
projects all around the world, and according to the International Energy Agency (IEA),
it is due to the industry’s unique sourcing structure.

The supply chains for clean energy technologies can be more complex and less
transparent compared with fossil fuel supply, the IEA said in a report earlier this year.
The supply of raw materials that clean energy tech heavily relies on –- especially
copper, nickel and lithium - is more geographically concentrated than oil or natural
gas. For some materials, just one country, China, dominates all aspects of the supply
chain from mining and processing to refining.

Ironically, China’s efforts to curb energy use to reduce
emissions have led to power shortages now affecting
manufacturers of components for renewable energy
projects. This summer, the Chinese government ordered
manufacturing regions such as Yunnan, Fujian, and
Xinjiang, all major producers of silicon metal, as well as
Guangdong and Jiangsu, to cut energy use. This forced
local factories to halt or significantly reduce production.

For countries like Japan, which rely on imports for nearly
all their raw materials, and now also on imports for most
solar panels and wind turbines, this has created major
challenges. Prices of silicon metal, used in solar panels and
semiconductors, hit a record of more than $10,000 per ton
in late September. Silicon prices rose 300% over just two
months, according to Bloomberg.

Copper is another key metal for renewable energy as it’s a highly efficient conductor
of electricity and heat. Copper hit a new high earlier this month and supply
disruptions in major producer countries are also a factor.

Metal prices have been on the rise partly due to “anticipation that the energy
transition away from fossil fuels will result in sizable increases in demand,” according
to a World Bank report.

Solar farms use copper for solar cells, cabling, and inverters. It’s used in the turbine
generator, transformers, and gearbox for wind power. The material is also widely used
in underground and subsea cables, and electric motors and batteries.

Goldman Sachs already nicknamed copper “the new gold,” and forecasted that the
green transition will increase demand between 600% to 900% by 2030 from 2020
levels, while stressing that the market is not ready for this kind of jump.

The hike in non-ferrous metals prices will have a significant impact on Japanese
manufacturing. Some are starting to agitate against rapid shifts to green tech.

“Overly drastic efforts to decarbonize will trigger a panic in the global economy.
Absorbing costs at this price level is not possible. We’ll see a series of price increase
being passed on to end-consumers starting next year," one industry source told
Japan’s Diamond magazine this month.


The bigger picture
Impacts are felt in other parts of the world. The Solar Energy Industries Association in
the U.S. said in a quarterly report that system prices rose both on quarter and on year
for the first time since 2014, when Wood Mackenzie started benchmarking data for
the industry lobby.

“Ongoing supply chain constraints and commodity price increases began to have a
significant impact on solar prices during the second quarter of 2021,” according to
the association. “The most significant price increases have come from higher input
costs (steel, aluminum, etc.) and elevated freight costs.”

Top global wind turbine makers have also been impacted by the new prices. In
August, Denmark’s Vestas cut its full-year revenue guidance, citing cost inflation in
transportation and raw materials. In July, Siemens Gamesa adjusted its guidance for
2021 and issued a second profit warning in less than three months. Siemens Gamesa
cited the sharp increase in raw material prices and increased costs for a new product.

In April, the World Bank said the increase in commodity prices should taper off next
year, but since then most energy-related commodities have only gone up and energy
shortages in China have fueled the rally.

What’s more, several basic factors make a dip in raw material costs less likely. For
example, wind turbines continue to expand their size and capacity, requiring more
materials such as steel. While the energy output from each kilogram of metal may be
increasing, the expectations for the volume of clean tech necessary to meet emission
reduction targets are also.

The sudden surge in raw materials will likely shed more light on how they’re sourced.
Child labor concerns frequently surround reports on the Democratic Republic of
Congo, which has half the world’s known deposits of cobalt, a key metal for EVs and
batteries. NGOs have also issued warning reports about mining’s impact on
indigenous communities and concerns about environmental impact.

The ESG aspect of raw material supply chains is still an issue rarely mentioned in
Japan. But, with commodity price inflation starting to be recognized, it’s only a matter
of time until the issue broadens to consideration of the “green” credentials of the
supply chain.

Overview of Japan’s Agrivoltaic Industry:
Sun’s Shining on a New Wave of Interest

Japan’s new energy strategy seeks to have solar rise to 15% of the power mix, more
than double the current level. But with access to suitable land proving difficult, many
solar developers are turning to the “agrivoltaic” business model as a way forward.

The commissioning of solar PV plants on agricultural land is a sensitive topic in Japan.
On the one hand, the country has a low self-sufficiency rate for food production and
any moves that could decrease farm yields has traditionally been a political no-go.
On the other hand, the area taken up by agriculture has decreased by 28% since 1958
due to the sector’s worsening economics. Installing solar panels on agricultural land
would offer farmers a second income that might revive some abandoned acres.

The government too seems to finally be on board with the economic and
environmental benefits of agrivoltaics and recently relaxed regulation to accelerate
developments.


Agrivoltaic projects in Japan















Source: METI

Status report
By the end of FY2019 there were 2,653 agrivoltaic projects, for approximately 670
MW of capacity, covering 742 hectares of agricultural land in Japan.

These projects were commissioned under the feed-in-tariff (FIT) program. The
government budgeted ¥1.4 billion to support agrivoltaics in FY2020. The market is
expected to keep growing to 4 GW installed capacity by 2030, according to the
consultancy firm RTS.

Many companies are collaborating with universities on agrivoltaics R&D, including
Chiba Ecological Energy, West Energy Solution and Looop. More Japanese
corporations such as ENEOS and Minna Denryoku have also made public their interest
in this market.
Getting approval to develop an agrivoltaic system is only half of the hurdle, as the
authorization can be revoked during the project’s lifetime. The land under an
agrivoltaic system must continue to be cultivated successfully for the solar component
to remain in operation. System owners must submit the crop yields every year.

Previously, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) carried out a
review of the projects every three years and approval for business continuity was
based solely on the yields from the underlying farmland. If they were at least 80% of
the average yields in the area, the project passed.

In 2018, that review process was extended to every 10 years. And, in April 2021,
MAFF even relaxed the 80% criteria for projects installed on degraded agricultural
land. In those cases, MAFF will only verify that the land is being cultivated but will not
impose a yield requirement.


Despite the easing of the rules, the risk associated with an agriculture + solar projects
is not small. Solar developers know it’s essential to build a solid partnership with the
person or company cultivating the land to ensure that yields are within MAFF targets.


How to set up a project
To develop an agrivoltaic system an application must be filed with the local
agricultural affairs committee to convert the status of the targeted piece of land. Here
the focus is also on the impact of the solar PV installation on farming activities. The
following data must be submitted:

o  Plan for the agrivoltaic system
o  Plan for farming under solar panels
o  Expectation of impact on farming with supporting data and a specialist opinion
o  If the agrivoltaic system owner and farmer are not the same person, a
document is required to certify that both parties agree the installer must bear
the removal costs at the end of the system’s life

The applications can be submitted at any time and are usually reviewed within a
month. About 88% of 340 applications were approved in 2018 based on a survey of

agricultural affairs committees.
For assets larger than 10 MW, an environmental impact assessment is necessary.
MAFF also requires a study of water drainage to ensure damage won’t occur to
nearby agricultural water channels.
While the application process might not be a major hurdle, the opposition of local
communities is more likely to impair project development.

A survey of agricultural affairs committees in 2018 found that about 18% of
respondents thought that agrivoltaic farming would spoil the landscape. Local
governments and farmers are also concerned that agrivoltaic development might
cause the decline of agriculture and accelerate the collapse of rural communities.

In the same survey, about 59% of respondents answered that they didn't think it
possible to properly cultivate crops under solar panels, and 48% thought agrivoltaic
wasn’t necessary.
A recent case study in Omaesaki city, Shizuoka prefecture, illustrates this opposition.
About 80% of local households opposed a recent agrivoltaic project and the city
intends to enact an ordinance restricting solar PV installation.

Like recent developments of solar utility assets, it is now crucial for developers to
convince local communities of the project benefits.


Costs and impact on crop yields
If agrivoltaic systems come with a higher EPC cost than standard PV systems due to
the panels' elevated position (some mention a 50% increase in racking costs), their
operation and maintenance costs can be substantially cheaper (possibly up to a factor
of eight) due to the maintenance of the land already performed for farming purposes.
The crops must meet a minimum yield and also bring financial revenues close enough
to their original value. It is also explicitly required that the agricultural land be restored
to its initial form at the system’s end of life.

According to a MAFF study, close to 65% of the agrivoltaic projects change the type
of agriculture in order to meet the constraints imposed by the PV system. MAFF
conducted a series of studies in FY2018 and FY2019 and found that blueberries and
kiwi fruits did not show any production impact from the introduction of agrivoltaic
systems.
In contrast, edamame beans yield loss didn’t make it a good candidate. The results for
tea varied, with less leaves but each leaf heavier than under conventional farming
conditions.

Crops that don’t require much sunlight, such as tea, rice, taro, sweet potato, cabbage,
Chinese cabbage, lettuce, mitsuba, grapes, peaches, pears, strawberries, onions,
asparagus, eggplants, peas, and Japanese gingers are well suited for agrivoltaic
cultivation.
The financial impact on farming can be contained, and the project’s feasibility comes
down to the monetization of the solar asset. MAFF is worried, however, that larger
scale development of agrivoltaics could have an impact on local markets for some
crops.


Case studies
To overcome local opposition, some developers emphasize the value they bring to
local communities. For example, West Energy Solution guarantees farmers the
revenues out of the solar projects that it builds for them.
FIT, a developer of green energy power systems for private investors, developed an
agrivoltaic project on a wheat field in Akitakada City, Hiroshima prefecture. The power
is used by a nearby hydroponic greenhouse, which reduces power procurement costs
and adds environmental value to the crops, which they hope will boost sales.

Oikos Tenryu in Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka prefecture, is reviving tea cultivation using
agrivoltaics. Several fields had been neglected due to the local aging population and
lack of workers. They partly subsidize the agricultural production with profits from
solar assets, hiring workers and fostering tea cultivation.

Agrivoltaic assets are also used for power retail, and this business model will likely be
more common in the future with the end of the feed-in-tariff. Chiba Okido Agrivoltaic
Plant was commissioned in 2019 in a collaboration between Chiba Eco Energy and
Shimizu Corporation. The plant is owned and managed by Shimizu, while Chiba
carries out the farming. The power generated is sold through a retailer belonging to
the Shimizu Group.

Going forward
Though financial impact on farming is limited, local opposition remains a major hurdle
for agrivoltaic development. Having local partners that can navigate the intricate
relations with the farming community is vital, even more so than for regular solar
projects. The 10-year license evaluation is a major risk and a serious partner to
manage farming operations is a must.

An additional risk is the FIT’s impending end, which further complicates the financial
planning of agrivoltaics and regular solar projects. It’s clear that developers and asset
owners will need to review and change their business model from April 2022 since PV
systems at 50 kW capacity or above will be subject to the new feed-in-premium
pricing model and/or PPAs.

Despite the risks, the future of Japan’s agrivoltaic market looks bright. The fact that
major domestic corporations like Shimizu are entering the field adds lobbying muscle
for further easing of regulations and overall state support.

MAFF’s budget requests for next fiscal year are another bullish signal for the
burgeoning market. The ministry’s wish list for a 16% budget increase is led by
initiatives to encourage a reduction of agriculture’s carbon footprint and a national
net-zero target for 2050. Offsetting emissions from crop cultivation with solar panels
could prove the final tipping point for an agrivoltaic revolution.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Carbon capture/ Exxon
Exxon will invest $400 million to expand carbon capture (CC) at its LaBarge natural
gas and helium fields in Wyoming, enabling annual CC of up to 1 mln tons. Currently,
an estimated 6-7 mln tons of CO2 are already captured yearly at LaBarge, a total that
represents about 20% of all the carbon now captured on earth. The new additional CC
project is expected to begin operations in 2025.

Energy transition/ Rio Tinto
Mining giant Rio Tinto will invest $7.5 bln through 2030 to slash carbon emissions by
half. The main focus will be its flagship iron ore business in Western Australia, where 1
GW of solar and wind energy will be built. Funds will also modernize the company’s
Australian aluminum smelters to run on renewable energy, which will require 5 GW of
solar and wind power. Those smelters account for about 10 mln tons of the company’s
annual 31.5 mln tons of carbon emissions.

Europe/ Green hydrogen
Chemicals giant INEOS will invest more than €2 bln to build electrolysis plants that will
make green hydrogen. Over the next 10 years the first plants will be built in Norway,
Germany and Belgium, with others planned in the UK and France. Over the course of
this decade, the EU plans to have as much as 40 GW of electrolysis capacity for green
hydrogen manufacture installed. Currently, Europe’s figure is less than 0.1 GW.

France/ Pink hydrogen
France will build two “nuclear hydrogen mega-factories” by 2030 as part of a five-year
clean energy program. President Macron wants France to be a leader in zero-carbon
energy production. Anti-nuclear voices criticized the plan, saying it will create nuclear
waste and therefore cannot be labeled as fully “green”. Macron has also backed the
development of new small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear tech and claimed that this
will provide reliable decarbonized baseload power. Macron’s plan focuses on the trio
of nuclear, hydrogen and renewable energy.

Oil/ Record profits
This year, European and U.S. oil firms might see profits rise as much as 720% and
1,300%, respectively, according to Refinitiv. Despite this historic windfall, the oil
majors aren’t expected to increase investment in upstream production due to calls by
the International Energy Agency (IEA) to invest more in renewable energy. Global oil
and gas investment could drop to $365 bln this year, according to Rystad Energy,
compared to $475 bln in 2019 and $740 bln in 2014.

Saudi Arabia/ Energy transition
Saudi Arabia announced that it will aim for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by
2060 and will invest more than $180 billion to meet that goal. One of the world’s top
oil producers will not, however, abandon oil in the coming decades, it said.
The country will, however, start a gradual shift in its energy strategy. One small aspect
of that will be the conversion of an oil rig in the Persian Gulf into a luxury resort with

three hotels. Known as The Rig, it’ll also have a ferris wheel, roller coaster, water
slides, theaters, and scuba diving. The Rig consists of several platforms spanning
50,000 sq/feet, and will be the world’s first vacation spot on an old oil rig.

UK/ Green investment
Billionaire Bill Gates will invest £400 million in green hydrogen, long-term energy
storage and sustainable aviation fuels in the UK. The partnership is “a boost to the
UK’s vision of a green industrial revolution,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson during
his government's Global Investment Summit, which led to pledges of £9.7 billion of
investment for the British economy.

UK/ Nuclear
The UK plans a new nuclear power plant at Sizewell in Suffolk, which already has two
nuclear stations. Sizewell’s A station was decommissioned in 2006. The proposed
Sizewell C station would generate 3.2 GW of electricity. Another part of the UK’s
transition to clean energy includes offering households £5,000 to scrap old gas boilers
and install low-carbon alternatives by 2035.

United States/ LNG
U.S.-based Venture Global LNG signed three long-term deals totaling 5 mln tons with
China, more than doubling the country’s annual LNG imports from the U.S. The gas
will be sourced from Venture’s new project in the state of Louisiana. In related news,
Poland’s state-run energy company, PGNiG, signed a 20-year deal with Venture
Global for 2 mln tons of LNG yearly. Poland seeks to lessen dependence on Russian
gas, which accounts for 2/3 of Poland’s total gas imports.

Wind/ Energy transition
The amount of wind blowing across the Earth can easily meet global electricity
demand, according to a study by Professors Rebecca Barthelmie and Sara Pryor at
Cornell University in New York. They say that investing in wind energy generation will
reduce global warming by 0.3 to 0.8 degrees Celsius by 2100. Wind energy
generation capacity grew by only 14 percent annually from 2006 to 2020.
