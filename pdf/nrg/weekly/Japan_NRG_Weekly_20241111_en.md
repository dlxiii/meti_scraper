MoE updates guidelines for green bonds, sustainability-linked bonds, and loans

(Government statement, Nov 8)
•  Aiming to promote sustainable finance, the MoE published 2024 guidelines for green bonds and
sustainability-linked bonds, along with guidelines for green loans and sustainability-linked loans.
•  The guidelines distinguish international principles from Japan-specific explanations, improving
alignment with evolving global standards and enabling rapid updates.
•  They now reflect recent revisions by the Loan Market Association and International Capital Market
Association, and offer additional domestic guidance, especially for sustainability-linked loans used

by financial institutions for client financing.
•  To ensure clarity and consistency, the MoE held a public comment period and sought input from
international bodies, whose feedback was incorporated.
•  CONTEXT: The majority of sustainability-linked loans in Japan are procured through the “SLL
Framework”, which financial institutions have developed as a financial product for customers,
rather than for their own funding purposes.
• TAKEAWAY: The plethora of taxonomies around the world make it complicated for investments to flow into

clean energy projects because the definitions of ‘green’ or ‘transition-linked’ vary. Japan has hitherto left its
banks and financial services to decide by themselves on the validity of green investments. That voluntary
approach, however, has made it difficult for domestic financial firms to explain and justify their investments to
international stakeholders. The latest government guideline updates aim to bridge the gaps between domestic
and international understandings.




MLIT l committee to discuss creating port infrastructure for hydrogen imports
(Government statement, Nov 7)
•  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) began a new committee
charged with analyzing how Japan can create a port infrastructure to facilitate hydrogen and
ammonia imports.
•  The Carbon Neutral Port initiative seeks to lower emissions of marine infrastructure; it will look at

factors for handling hydrogen and ammonia at terminals. Discussions will focus on safety, facility
planning, and transport systems able to cope with large-volume imports.
•  The committee’s first meeting is Nov 11. Attendees include Miyake Atsumi, Professor at the
Institute of Advanced Sciences, Yokohama National University; Aoyama Katsuhiro of the Clean Fuel
Ammonia Association; and Hiroshi Fukushima of the Japan Hydrogen Association; as well as local
officials in charge of port management in Kawasaki City and Aichi Pref.

Govt maintains schedule to draft GX2040 Vision by the end of 2024
(Government statement, Oct 31)
•  By the end of 2024, the government will present its draft GX2040 Vision at the GX Implementation
Council, maintaining its schedule for the announcement.
•  Accelerating investment in new fields of decarbonization, such as local renewable energy, was

emphasized. This is expected to have a ripple effect on the local economy and will improve the
environment. It was also noted that accelerating DX through the use of AI could optimize GX’s
impact.
•  The MoE plans to submit the next GHG reduction target to the UN by Feb 2025, and will also
review the Global Warming Countermeasures Plan on reducing emissions.
•  CONTEXT: The GX2024 Vision will serve as the basis for the Basic Energy Plan and the Global

Warming Countermeasures Plan, and will set out the energy and GX industry location, GX industry
structure, GX market creation, and global awareness and rules that should be achieved by around
2040.
• TAKEAWAY: The idea for this “vision”, which is separate from the Basic Energy Plan, was first floated by then
PM Kishida, who dubbed it GX 2.0. It arrived as a response to the sudden realization in government that a new
way of AI, data center, semiconductor and other tech infrastructure in Japan will massively increase electricity

demand. This new document was touted as a blueprint for mapping where the new tech demand would
appear and help synchronize the rollout of more clean energy facilities with it. As such, logically the
“vision” has to come before the Plan is published and the end-of-year announcement was flagged earlier in
the process.



Poland to cooperate with Japan on nuclear power

(Japan NRG, Nov 6)
•  METI and Poland’s Ministry of Industry inked agreements on nuclear energy, aiming to provide
Japanese nuclear technology, build supply chains, and train specialists. Discussions are also
underway on managing radioactive waste.
•  Poland, which relies on coal for 70% of its power, faces energy challenges due to halted oil and
gas imports from Russia. Seeking to diversify its energy sources, Poland plans to build its first

nuclear power plant by 2030.
•  The countries will promote SMRs developed by GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, with Japan providing
expertise in HTGRs. Poland also plans to build 6 large light-water reactors by 2043, which would
meet about 23% of the country’s power needs. Japan is promoting Toshiba’s steam turbines and
IHI’s containment vessels.
•  CONTEXT: SMRs are smaller and, in theory, more cost-effective than traditional reactors because
they are designed as modules that can be assembled at a factor rather than onsite. HTGRs, which

use helium gas instead of water for cooling, can be applied to both power generation and
hydrogen production.
• TAKEAWAY: Japanese collaboration on HTGRs is managed by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA).
Poland plans to use this tech as a heat source for its chemical sector, and might build a research reactor with
an output of 30 MW. But Poland isn’t relying only on Japan’s nuclear tech as it seeks to install up to 9 GW of
nuclear capacity by 2040. Its first NPP will be built by Westinghouse based on AP1000 tech. For Japan, it’s

important to be involved in the construction of new reactors overseas as it supports the business case for
domestic manufacturers to retain their nuclear divisions.



IHI green ammonia production trial succeeds at center in Fukushima

(Company statement, Nov 8)
•  IHI said it successfully tested a green ammonia production system at its Soma IHI Green Energy
Center (Fukushima Pref) that delivers just 1kg/ day.
•  The system uses IHI’s Power-to-X tech to produce ammonia using renewable energy. IHI wants to
scale up production and commercialize it.
•  CONTEXT: IHI’s goal is to convert renewable energy into heat and hydrogen. The same Power-to-

X tech at the Soma center was used to produce synthetic methane fuel, then utilized by a local bus
in a pilot phase. The center was opened in 2018.

Toshiba Energy Systems launches PV integrated management services
(Company statement, Nov 5)
•  Toshiba Energy Systems has developed a new service for solar farm operators – an integrated PV
management service.
•  This is a service in the “TOSHIBA SPINEX for Energy” lineup, which provides centralized power

facility monitoring services.
•  Since it’s built on Toshiba's cloud system, it can acquire data from monitoring systems made by
other companies and centrally manage multiple solar farms.
•  The system displays the operational status of multiple power plants in real time, and also has an
incident response function that contributes to rapid on-site response
•  CONTEXT: The number of solar farms has increased rapidly due to the FIT system, but in many

cases the monitoring systems and O&M operations differ from plant to plant; power generation

companies that own multiple solar farms need services to integrate power plant monitoring
systems and enable efficient operation.



SMFG and Enechain launch firm to stabilize fuel prices
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 8)
•  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Enechain set up a new company, eXtend, to provide
hedging services against fuel price fluctuations for power generation and electricity retail firms. It

will help clients secure fuel at fixed prices, regardless of international market volatility.
•  Launched with ¥1 billion in capital, eXtend is led by Enechain’s Arai Tomoya. It will trade LNG,
crude oil, and coal on international markets, including ICE and CME.
•  The company will generate revenue through service fees from power utilities, which benefit from
fixed procurement prices, mitigating the impact of fuel price volatility.



TEPCO launches a VPP test using solar power for Tokyo facilities

(Company statement, Nov 1)
•  TEPCO launched a VPP pilot at Tokyo region municipal facilities.
•  As an initial test, the electricity generated by solar power at a municipal apartment building will be
supplied to the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum; the usefulness and reliability of Area Energy
Management Systems (AEMS) will be evaluated.
•  In 2025, the Tokyo Metro Govt will step up efforts to upgrade and optimize energy use through
AEMS at a wide range of municipal facilities, such as schools, parks and apartment complexes, and
to allow these facilities to share electricity.

•  CONTEXT: In June 2022, TEPCO agreed with the Tokyo Govt to promote carbon neutrality
initiatives.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toho Gas invests in PowerX, eyes renewables expansion
(Company statement, Nov 5)
o  Toho Gas invested in PowerX, a startup specializing in batteries, aiming to strengthen the

firm’s renewable energy business, including solar power.
o  The investment amount and acquisition ratio were not disclosed.



Mitsui Chemicals and Sustech to launch pilot for solar panel reuse
(Company statement, Nov 6)
•  Mitsui Chemicals and startup Sustech will cooperate to reuse discarded solar panels amid an
anticipated surge in discarded panels by the mid-2030s.
•  The project involves evaluating old panels for reuse, constructing power plants with viable solar
cells, and selling generated electricity directly to businesses.

•  The initiative aims to reduce environmental impact, costs, and waste associated with solar panel
disposal, and to explore scaling up reused-panel power plants.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Solar power adoption rose following the introduction of the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) in 2012.
With FIT 20-year terms expiring, the replacement of solar panels is on the rise. However, currently
most discarded panels are landfilled rather than reused. By the mid-2030s, panel waste is expected
to rise sharply.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Shikoku Electric to build floating solar PV
(Company statement, Nov 5)
o  Shikoku Electric will build its fourth floating solar power plant on Taniike Pond
(Takamatsu City, Kagawa Pref). Operations are set to start in September 2025.
o  The facility is expected to generate 2 GWh annually and will operate under a PPA.



Toshiba develops Li-ion battery for ultra-fast charging

(Company statement, Nov 6)
•  Toshiba has developed a lithium-ion battery, the SCiB Nb, designed for ultra-fast charging, and
will commercialize it by spring 2025, targeting global sales for electric buses and other EVs.
•  The SCiB Nb uses niobium titanium oxide (NTO) in its anode, which improves conductivity and
enhances battery performance. This tech has less performance degradation, even after repeated
ultra-fast charging.
•  The company says the battery can recover about 70% of its capacity with just five minutes of ultra-
fast charging, and maintains over 80% of capacity after more than 15,000 ultra-fast charge-

discharge cycles. It also performs well in extreme temperatures, ranging from -30°C to 60°C.
•  Since June, Toshiba has been testing the battery in collaboration with Sojitz and CBMM, a niobium
producer in Brazil.



HPTCJ to promote heat pumps in new residential apartments
(Organization statement, Nov 6)
•  The Heat Pump & Thermal Storage Technology Center of Japan published survey results about
introducing heat pump water heaters in new residential apartments.
•  To expand their use it’s necessary to revise the performance evaluation standards and introduce

preferential treatment for users, in addition to resolving issues such as cost and availability of
installation space.
•  As an incentive, new standards are proposed that emphasize energy-saving, and subsidies and tax
incentives for homes built to such standards.
•  CONTEXT: Hot water production accounts for about 30% of CO2 emissions in the residential
sector; thus it has a high reduction potential, and the use of heat pumps can promote

decarbonization. Compared to conventional water heaters, the heat pump can reduce CO2
emissions in hot water supply by about 60%.

TEPCO’s next business plan stalls amid uncertainty over reactor restarts

(Denki Shimbun, Nov 6)
•  Due to uncertainty over restarting the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, TEPCO Holdings faces delays in
drafting its next Comprehensive Special Business Plan. The Nuclear Damage Compensation and
Decommissioning Facilitation Corp, which oversees these plans, has not held a committee meeting
since July.
•  The delay stems from unclear mid- to long-term profit targets, which are highly contingent on the
NPP’s restart date. Previous plans included multiple scenarios based on potential restart timelines;
but setting realistic dates is challenging due to the unpredictable positions of Japan’s government

and that of Niigata Pref.
•  The next Business Plan is supposed to provide profit projections through FY2035, with varying
scenarios based on potential restart timings. TEPCO HD needs to complete the plan by the end of
this fiscal year but feels unsure how to proceed until it has guidance from the state.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Retrieved nuclear fuel debris within safety limits

(Asahi Shimbun, Nov 7)
o  TEPCO successfully conducted a trial retrieval of melted nuclear fuel debris from Unit 2 at
Fukushima Daiichi NPP — a 5mm piece of debris was removed from a metal box linked
to the reactor's containment vessel.
o  This retrieval is the first of its kind outside of Three Mile Island's Unit 2 reactor after its
1979 meltdown.
o  TEPCO plans to analyze this debris to develop methods for large-scale recovery; an

estimated 880 tons of debris remains across Units 1–3.
o  CONTEXT: The retrieval has faced multiple setbacks, including equipment misconnection
in August and camera issues in September.
• TAKEAWAY: After overcoming technical challenges and delays, this step is a milestone in the complex
decommissioning process. It’s a morale booster for TEPCO and the academics involved, and seeks to reassure
the public that the Fukushima Daiichi NPP site can be fully decommissioned in time.




Mutsu’s interim storage for spent nuclear fuel launches
(Company statement, Nov 6)
•  Japan's first interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel began operations, (located in Mutsu City,
Aomori Pref). Operated by Recyclable-Fuel Storage Co, it received official clearance from the NRA
on the same day.
•  CONTEXT: In late September, the facility accepted its first metal cask from the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa

NPP, capable of holding 69 spent fuel assemblies. The storage facility currently holds 288 casks. It

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

has a total uranium weight capacity of 3,000 tons. Planned expansion for a second building will
bring the total capacity to 5,000 tons, with each structure able to hold waste for up to 50 years.
•  CONTEXT: It will store spent fuel from TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP where storage is nearing
80% capacity. So, moving fuel off-site is essential for reactor operation. The mayor of Kashiwazaki
has set a storage limit of 80% or less as a condition for reactor restarts.

• TAKEAWAY: This facility is a unique opportunity for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, since it now can count on an
interim storage facility, which is not possible for other NPPs that must resort to building on-site facilities. But
Chugoku Electric and KEPCO are surveying for such a facility in Kaminoseki, Yamaguchi Pref. Either way, the
facility is a mid-term solution that delays the need to identify and create a long-term nuclear waste storage hub
by a few decades.




Mitsubishi Electric to invest ¥16 bln in switchgear and power electronics production
(Company statement, Oct 30)
•  Mitsubishi Electric is investing ¥16 billion to boost production of switchgear and power electronics.
•  Of that amount, ¥12 billion will be allocated for expanding facilities and adopting decarbonization
practices in the U.S.; the construction of the new facility has been supported by a $6.75 million
grant proposal from Pennsylvania.
•  The U.S. investment includes transitioning to environmentally friendly vacuum circuit breakers from

traditional SF6 gas circuit breakers.
•  The remaining ¥4 billion will be used to increase production in Japan. It will reorganize the layout
of production areas within its Amagasaki substation systems factory to increase the production of
switchgear, including key components.



TOCOM  hits record daily trading volume on Nov 7
(Exchange statement, Nov 8)
•  The TOCOM power futures market hit a record-high daily trading volume of 153.72 GWh on Nov

7, surpassing the previous record set on May 13, 2022 (142 GWh).
•  CONTEXT: TOCOM has struggled to replicate the EEX’s success in the electricity market; the
recent entrance of more international players to TOCOM has improved liquidity.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hokuto Bank becomes industry's first electricity retailer
(Company statement, Nov 1)
o  Hokuto Bank (Akita City, Akita Pref) set up Fidea Energy to support regional

decarbonization efforts. Fidea is the first firm in the banking industry’s advanced services
sector to handle electricity retailing.
o  Fidea will use renewables such as wind power. It will also operate businesses in
renewable energy generation and carbon credit trading.
• TAKEAWAY: Several major banks have ventured into electricity trading in various forms but none have
considered making electricity retailing as a business opportunity. For an Akita based bank, a region where the

offshore wind sector is expected to grow significantly, this may be more about scoring green points than
profit. It will be curious to see how serious this venture becomes.

Excess power adjustment directive averted in Kansai as grid struggles to balance
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 6)
•  A transfer of electricity between regions was first ordered then abandoned on Nov 3 as the Kansai
area struggled to balance supply with demand.
•  CONTEXT: The warm and sunny fall weather helped increase power output, but Nov 3 was a

Sunday and a day before a Monday national holiday. Hence, demand was low.
•  On Nov 3, Kansai Electric sent a forecast to OCCTO that indicated it will produce too much
electricity between 10:30 am and 11 am.
•  OCCTO advised the utility to transfer 78 MW of power to Hokuriku Electric.
•  OCCTO warned of "insufficient lowering capacity," indicating a supply-demand imbalance risk,
especially on days when renewable output is high, and demand is low.

•  Upon reassessment, the Kansai grid operator (Kansai T&D) determined the transfer was
unnecessary, having achieved the needed capacity reduction by maximizing adjustments within its
area. Fossil fuel generation was minimized, and renewable energy sources were curtailed by
around 1.7 GW from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
•  OCCTO’s directive cancellation due to self-managed adjustments is rare, underscoring the
effectiveness of Kansai T&D's renewable energy output control measures in balancing power

demand locally.
• TAKEAWAY: Similar directives to transfer surplus power from Kansai to other regions were issued in June 2023
and June 2024 under comparable conditions. While this time curtailment helped to bring the grid into
balance, the large volume of ‘lost’ electricity indicates the role that batteries and other forms of energy storage
can play during low-demand periods, such as holidays, especially when sunny weather boosts solar output.




Onagawa NPP Unit 2 halted due to malfunction
(Company statement, Oct 3)
•  During a test for restarting Unit 2 of the Onagawa NPP, a calibration device used to measure
neutrons inside the reactor stopped moving. Preparations are now underway to shut down the
reactor to inspect the device.
•  CONTEXT: The reactor was restarted on Oct 29 and reached criticality on Oct 30, with fuel loading

beginning on Oct 28 and concluding on Nov 3. Commercial operations are planned to start in
December.
•  CONTEXT: The malfunctioning equipment is used to monitor neutron detectors that verify the
reactor's critical state.
• TAKEAWAY: Minor malfunctions are expected, particularly since the plant is coming back online after a 13-
year dormancy. However, this issue could be challenging. While the procedure is standard for plant restarts,
this particular malfunction is unprecedented, which may require additional time to address and could impact

the planned December restart.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Chugoku Electric completes loading fuel at Shimane NPP Unit 2

(Company statement, Nov 3)
o  Chugoku Electric completed loading nuclear fuel into Shimane NPP’s Unit 2 reactor in
Matsue City. The restart is planned for early December.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Next steps involve assembling the reactor pressure vessel and containment vessel. If
NRA pre-use inspection approval is granted, the reactor will restart, the first time since
Jan 2012; commercial operation is expected in early January 2025.
o  CONTEXT: Shimane Unit 2, like TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi, is a BWR reactor. This will
mark the second BWR restart since the Fukushima incident. The first was Tohoku

Electric’s restart of Onagawa NPP.



NRA accepts tsunami countermeasures for Tomari NPP
(Nikkei, Nov 8)
•  Hokkaido Electric sent the NRA its tsunami measures for the planned restart of Tomari NPP’s Unit
3. And the NRA approved them.
•  The utility confirmed its estimated tsunami heights exceeded both past tsunami records and state
figures.
•  CONTEXT: Seismic and plant-related reviews are still pending. Even if they receive the permits,

Hokkaido Electric will need the consent of Hokkaido's governor to restart the plant. The utility also
plans to develop a harbor outside the plant grounds for nuclear fuel transport.
• TAKEAWAY: Tomari NPP is the only nuclear power plant in Hokkaido. Its Unit 3 has been waiting for restart
approval for 11 years. There are many reasons for the delay, including the utility’s lack of personnel able to
correctly report safety measures to the NRA, and the necessity of reinforcing the ground beneath a seawall at
the plant, as well as elevating its height. The restart is critical for the regional economy, where semiconductor

producer Rapidus plans to start production at its factory in Chitose using renewables. In the company’s plan,
Tomari NPP may be used as a backup power source.



eRex to expand biomass power generation in SE Asia
(Nikkei, Oct 30)
•  eRex will start co-firing biomass fuel at coal-fired power plants in Vietnam, and will build a biomass-

dedicated power plant in Cambodia.
•  eRex will co-fire biomass at six power plants owned by the state-run Vietnam National Coal and
Mineral Industries, with a combined capacity exceeding 1.5 GW.
•  By spring 2025, it will conduct trials at two plants, using about 20% locally sourced biomass fuel.
The project will receive support from organizations including NEDO.
•  eRex is considering selling the environmental value generated through biomass co-firing as carbon

credits in Japan.
•  Though eRex is already constructing three biomass-only plants in Vietnam, this marks its first co-
firing initiative in the country.
•  In Cambodia, eRex will build a power plant that combines solar and biomass power, with a total
capacity of 90 MW. The project, expected to cost around ¥10–20 billion.
•  CONTEXT: Southeast Asia, with rising electricity demand, remains heavily reliant on coal-fired
power. According to the IEA, Vietnam’s power generation in 2022 was double that of a decade

ago. Both Vietnam and Cambodia are pursuing cleaner energy options. SE Asia's abundant wood
resources present an opportunity to enhance energy self-sufficiency through biomass power.

• TAKEAWAY: Although eRex’s primary business is in Japan, it has increased investments in SE Asia. In Vietnam,
eRex plans to expand its biomass power plants to 19 locations by 2035. In May, it formed an alliance with JFE
Engineering, Kyudenko, and other firms to support its overseas expansion. On the one hand, it’s natural for a
company to look for projects in other countries, but perhaps this also suggests that one of Japan’s biggest
biomass power generation companies is running out of profitable opportunities in the domestic market. Which

could be due to a shortage of available biofuel materials within Japan.

To Keep the Lights on, New Energy Market Rules Collide With Reality

The power sector is staring down a winter of possible blackouts and strained
resources at peak demand. That’s odd because the Capacity Market, which became
effective this year, was conceived by the nationwide grid oversight body, OCCTO,
specifically to ensure that adequate capacity was on hand.

Originally designed to ensure adequate power supply four years in advance,
OCCTO’s main Capacity Market was launched in 2020. It even attracted higher-than-
forecast prices to keep the major power utilities from mothballing expensive older
power plants that OCCTO saw as vital for retaining stable market supply during peak
periods.

Four years on, and OCCTO’s forecasts appear to have fallen short of today’s
electricity needs. With utilities struggling to keep up with demands on days with
extreme weather, the grid operators (TSOs) have been blindsided. This year, the TSOs
have issued energy alerts at unprecedented rates. Based on current rules, the grids
may run out of their alert allocations.

The weather has undoubtedly undermined OCCTO’s best-laid plans, while a
resurgence in power demand from industry and a data center boom was clearly not
on the grid oversight body’s bingo card for this year.


Japan recorded its hottest summer this year since comparable data collection started
in 1989. Average temperatures between June through August were 1.76 degrees
Celsius higher in 2024 than during the same period between 1991 and 2020.

Solution, maybe?
In theory, the capacity market should have prevented the disbalance in power supply
and volatility within and between regions. Under OCCTO projections, the percentage
of power capacity held in reserve, known as the reserve margin, was supposed to
comfortably meet peak demand nationwide.

Recent weather, natural disasters and consumption-side shocks have disrupted these
assumptions. In mid-September, Tokyo and Tohoku regions saw reserve margins fall
to a negative 1.6%, prompting the issuance of a Power Supply Emergency Alert. This
shortfall arose as the big utilities, also known as EPCOs, took plants offline for
maintenance after the summer’s peak, only for an unexpected heatwave to spike air-
conditioning usage.

TSOs in Hokuriku, Chubu, Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu have faced similar
difficulties, issuing multiple alerts as demand surged. The system’s design has only
compounded the problem. TSOs can issue alerts twelve times per year, but with
erratic weather patterns, many have already issued nine or ten alerts. If severe winter
conditions emerge, they may not have any alerts left to call.



16

Seeing the severity of the situation, METI has recently loosened the alert thresholds
from the previous 8% margin to 5%. In addition, OCCTO has even asked TEPCO
Power Grid to postpone their maintenance schedule — a rare move that signals
doubts about the Capacity Market’s efficacy.

EPCOs, meanwhile, find themselves shouldering new costs from delayed infrastructure
maintenance, exacerbating their already thin margins.

A standby system on standby
The Capacity Market relies on three pillars: a primary market for capacity four years in
advance; the Long-Term Decarbonization Power Source Auction (LTDA) to fund new
low-emissions power sources; and the Standby Power Source System that taps idle
power sources to backfill shortages.

The latter, a safeguard for large-scale outages, is essential as Japan phases out
thermal power plants and brings online more intermittent renewable energy facilities.
The Standby System’s goal is to ‘stockpile’ dormant generation assets of 100 MW in
capacity or larger that could restart within three months to a year. Yet the first auction
held in 2024, which was meant to secure 1 GW of capacity across east and west Japan
for operation in FY2025 to FY2026, ended without a single bid.

The major utilities that own the older generation plants that OCCTO hoped to secure
via this standby system balked at the maintenance fees that the grid oversight body
proposed for retired oil-fired plants. These were deemed simply insufficient to
compensate utilities’ costs. What’s more, the skilled technicians that are critical to
upkeep these aging units are also scarce.


Worse still, OCCTO’s ever-more-complex rules and expanded Capacity Market
systems may have disqualified some of the power plants it sought to retain. The
Standby System is only available for units that were not selected in two successive
capacity market rounds. But why would a utility keep spending on maintenance for an
aging power plant if it was unable to secure any OCCTO fees over two years?

The LTDA section of the Capacity Market has justifiably won praise from BESS
operators and certain other energy storage facilities. But in terms of securing the
capacity that a TSO may need to maintain stable supplies in times of peak load, LTDA
has fared little better.

Barely a day after the announcement of the first round of LTDA results, in early 2024,
JERA signaled that it might actually abandon the contract it secured in the auction to
cover the costs of building new units at its Chita Thermal Power Plant. JERA seemed
willing to pay the penalties rather than meet the auction’s stringent revenue-sharing
terms.

The LTDA promises fixed revenue for up to 20 years, thus de-risking the initial
investment in new capacity. But in return, successful bidders must return 90% of
profits generated from any other electricity sales or transactions made outside of the
capacity-guarantee contract. Thus, the upside is capped.



17



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

For now, JERA has proceeded with an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the
Chita investment, but has not yet confirmed that it would go ahead with the plans.
Perhaps JERA is holding out for concessions from METI, but either way it sets a risky
precedent and puts OCCTO’s plans to secure capacity under further strain.

Conclusion
The precise requirements of the Capacity Market framework are now working against
OCCTO. And a desire to restrain payments to older thermal capacity, which is seen as
only a stop-gap before the transition to cleaner facilities, has also played against the
national grid manager, hobbling the reliability of Japan’s power network.

The fixes for this winter are currently debated among METI policy committees. These
include allowing TSOs to issue more alerts and the loosening of regulations around
pumped hydro stations for EPCOs.

Yet these are only the immediate responses, and broader reforms are needed to align
the incentives for generators and TSOs while ensuring robust competition. In
structuring the mechanisms for standby and capacity auctions, OCCTO may have
overlooked the old truism: Nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution.

ANALYSIS

Accidental Ammonia Discovery Makes Solid Case for its Use in Energy Storage

Ammonia, a fuel free from carbon emissions when burned, has long tantalized
scientists but left them with a dilemma: it’s both toxic and troublesome to handle. In
its natural gaseous state, it must be stored at a frigid -33°C to remain liquid, and even
then, storage tanks corrode, and a single leak can be deadly.

Yet, such impossible challenges have often led to breakthroughs, and the one that
could potentially catapult ammonia into the top tiers of the energy transition is no
different. It came from an unlikely corner of Japan’s academia.

In 2023, Japanese chemist Dr. Morishita Masao discovered a compound — borane —
that solidifies ammonia at room temperature, sidestepping the perils of handling the
gas.

Researchers were startled. Until Morishita’s findings, attempts to store ammonia in
solid form largely involved trapping it in metal-organic frameworks, absorbing it into
metal hydrides, or converting it into safer compounds like fertilizers. Yet Morishita
solidified it in a pure form.


The implications are clear: if ammonia can be stored and transported in solid form,
which is much easier and cheaper to handle, energy firms could move it across the
globe without specialized cryogenic tanks. For Japan, it opens the tantalizing
possibility of tapping into vast clean ammonia production resources overseas and
shipping it for domestic use without the need for a new, trillion-yen industry supply
chain based on highly specialized equipment.

Still, engineers and business developers in ammonia supply projects have mostly
dismissed it. They claim that converting vast amounts of ammonia from solid to liquid
or gas form will consume huge amounts of energy, rendering it impractical for large-
scale deployment in power plants or industry.

So, will this discovery live on only in textbooks, or does it have a chance of
commercial success? Japan NRG spoke with dozens of industry players to piece
together the behind-the-scenes story of this development.

Accidentally on purpose
Morishita stumbled upon his discovery by chance. In 2023, his lab at the University of
Hyogo was testing borane solutions to develop cheaper production methods for
ammonia boron, a hydrogen carrier, when a student made an unexpected
observation. A glass-like substance had formed, crystallizing ammonia in a stable
matrix.

“My student came running, like, ‘Oh dear, what have I done…,’” Morishita recalls.
With a retirement in sight in 2024, Morishita’s plans were abruptly shelved when the
National Institute of Material Sciences (NIMS) quickly offered him a position to pursue
this curious reaction further.

Scientists may have celebrated the advance, but the business world was indifferent.
Globally, firms have largely focused on ammonia utilization inside fuel cells to convert
its energy into power, not as an energy-absorbing storage structure. IHI Corp, one of
Japan’s leaders in the ammonia supply chain, confirmed to Japan NRG that it has
“zero research” planned on solid-state ammonia, and only KRI, an Osaka Gas
subsidiary, has ever attempted such an approach. KRI’s trials, however, failed due to
swelling in the storage medium, making it infeasible.

NIMS is now courting industry players to explore partnerships in ammonia
solidification, hoping to crack its mechanism and clarify recovery processes.
Morishita’s findings hint that solid-state ammonia crystals start releasing gas at 52°C
and stay solid until 100°C, bypassing the liquid phase altogether and minimizing
flammability.

The promise of boric glass
In existing applications, ammonia breaks into hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen at
temperatures between 400°C and 600°C, depending on the catalyst used. Morishita
aims to lower this threshold by developing a new catalyst, seeking a breakthrough in
materials science.

“The boric glass matrix is not the only ammonia carrier,” he suggests. “Finding the
right combination could revolutionize the field.”

Solid-state ammonia has a high energy density — over 1,000 Wh/kg in gas form —
but compresses to just 1/1000 of its gaseous volume when solid, with a density
comparable to its liquid state, according to the Ammonia Energy Association.

Morishita has two use case scenarios in mind: to directly produce hydrogen from
solid-state ammonia on board vehicles, and to store ammonia in a solid state at
manned premises of power generating plants so that it can then be blended with coal
for co-firing.

Onboard hydrogen conversion from solid-state ammonia could enable safer storage
in vehicles and ships. Chemical engineers estimate that for cars, conversion must
occur below 100°C to allow rapid start and shutdown of internal combustion systems.

Pursuing this goal has not only an economic rationale, it could also boost safety. At
power plants, ammonia in a solid state would reduce risks from leaks from gas or
liquid tanks. A rupture in a liquid ammonia tank could release hazardous fumes.

The burning question
Not all eyes, however, are on boric glass. Another group at Japan’s National Institute
of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) headed by Kawamoto Tohru is
working on solidifying ammonia as ammonium bicarbonate, a compound commonly
used in fire extinguishers and baking powder.

Their technology, initially aimed at capturing nitrogen oxides (NOx), produces
ammonia that’s later converted into ammonium bicarbonate for storage. In the lab,
ammonium bicarbonate releases ammonia at around 60-70°C.

Bench trials of AIST’s approach, known as NOx-to-ammonia (NTA), are already
underway across Japan, and Ube Corp, a chemical producer, plans to run a pilot.

The bottom line
For energy firms, the key question remains: how much energy does it take to shift
ammonia from solid to gas and back?

“If ammonia is too stable in room temperatures and pressures, it may require huge
energy to take it out of the glass matrix,” said one researcher.

The real answer is that few companies in Japan are actually doing the research to
make any conclusions, but at least flickers of interest are there.

It’s clear that solid-state ammonia could reduce transport costs and risks. A sector that
could be among the first to embrace this energy solution is shipping.

One fuel tank manufacturer says that solid-state ammonia as a storage method has
appeal for ammonia-fueled ships. Early designs for vessels powered by ammonia were
made with the idea that they would be unmanned, due to safety risks. Ammonia in
solid form changes the calculus.


Companies that have suffered from ammonia incidents in the past welcome any new
ideas to enhance safety, including solid-state ammonia. Most incidents occur due to
process errors of contractors and subcontractors.

But state funding would be required to cover the initial R&D costs, as companies feel
it’s too premature to develop any business case.

The misconceptions around this technology are equally daunting. There’s a widely
held idea even among those working in ammonia-related projects that solid-state
ammonia must liquefy before gasifying. This is not actually the case. Equally, others
assume that a solid-state ammonia product is aimed to replace ammonia gas. In the
absence of reliable data and sufficient information, most in the industry are making
misguided guesses.

For now, the Education Ministry funds Morishita’s research, and he plans to pursue
additional grants from the government, hoping to turn borane glass into a viable
hydrogen carrier and expand Japan’s clean energy portfolio. AIST’s Moonshot
Program is funding the NOx-to-ammonia project.

If this unconventional treatment of ammonia proves viable, it could tackle some of the
thorniest issues in hydrogen and hydrogen-related transport and storage, helping
usher in a new alternative for clean energy. But for the moment, the journey has just
begun.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Asia / Clean energy
Capital allocation in the energy sector is increasingly prioritizing clean energy, with 75-
85% of funds raised in Asia in 2022-2023 directed toward the energy transition, says
Kelvin Wong, global head of renewables, and infrastructure at DBS Bank.

Australia / Rooftop solar
Each year, Australia needs to deploy about 3 GW of rooftop solar PV, and between 6-
7 GW of utility-scale renewable energy, said Kane Thornton, head of the Clean Energy
Council.

China / Crude imports
Crude oil imports fell 9% in October, a sixth consecutive monthly decline; a plant
closure at a state oil refinery added to weaker demand from independent refiners. The
world's largest crude oil importer brought in 44.7 MMT last month, or about 10.53
mbpd, down from 11.07 mbpd in Sept and 11.53 mbpd in Oct 2023.

Energy / Global investment
Energy investments globally are expected to reach $3.1 trillion this year, a 5% annual
growth from $2.4 trillion in 2018, according to the World Investment Report. Clean
energy investment alone is expected to nearly double that of fossil fuels, increasing
from $1.2 trillion in 2018 to $2 trillion by the end of 2024.

India / Renewable energy
The govt approved 50 solar parks with a combined capacity of nearly 37.5 GW, said
Minister of Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi, adding that the country has identified
potential offshore wind sites to reach its 30 GW goal by 2030.

Pakistan / Grid
Oracle Power announced completion of its transmission and grid interconnection
study for its proposed 1.3 GW hybrid renewable energy plant in Sindh region.

South Korea / Nuclear power
The U.S. and South Korea pledged greater cooperation in civilian nuclear energy
industries, and they signed an MoU on topics affecting nuclear exports and
cooperation.

Taiwan / Electricity
Chipmaker TSMC will pay more for its power in Taiwan than in any of the other
countries in which it operates due to the increasing domestic price of energy. The cost
of electricity in Taiwan has doubled in the past few years, as subsidizing power is
untenable for the government. TSMC also has chip plants in the U.S. and Japan.

Vietnam / Wind power
NMDC Group and Vingroup signed an MoU that covers strategic partnerships in
various areas, including the development of offshore wind in Vietnam.
