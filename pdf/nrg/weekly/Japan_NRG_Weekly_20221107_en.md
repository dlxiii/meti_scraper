PM pushes for more automotive initiatives for decarbonization and digitization
(Japan NRG, Nov. 2)
•  PM Kishida met with a group of business leaders to push decarbonization, digitization and other
changes in the mobility sector.
•  The PM suggests setting priorities for the govt and private sector in order to cope with geopolitical
constraints on supply chains and global decarbonization trends.
•  The priorities will be discussed in the next mobility business leaders meeting.

• TAKEAWAY: This is potentially a very big development and shows that the government is not convinced that
electrification will spread sufficiently in the auto and other transport sectors.



Renewable operators claim Ukraine impact on costs
(Japan NRG, Nov. 1)
•  Renewable operator groups claimed to the Power Tariff Committee that the Ukraine crisis has
driven up their costs; this comes as the Committee prepares the 2023 tariff levels.
•  About 55% of rooftop residential installations saw a more than 15% cost rise, YoY, on the back of

the weaker yen and semiconductor shortages.
•  Wind projects have suffered delays as component supply tightened globally and prices rose 20-
86%.
•  Key biomass import prices surged in the range of 20-50% on higher freight and tight feed supply,
lacking Russian material.
•  The groups requested that the Committee take into account these cost rises when deciding the
2023 tariffs.

• TAKEAWAY: Some experts argue that renewable cost rises are moderate compared to fossil fuel prices. Spot
commodity prices are often used to make cost comparisons, but prices reflect market trends, not costs.
Japanese companies have limited direct exposure to spot markets as they have long-term contracts and may
be paying more or less than spot levels, depending on contract terms.

FIP system needs reform: Japan Wind Power Association
(Japan NRG, Nov. 1)
•  The Japan Wind Power Association reported to the Power Tariff Committee that the project
financing feed-in-premium (FIP) system faces challenges as banks claim it lacks visibility on the

power business future.
•  Renewable output curbs also contribute to a lack of visibility.
•  The Association urged the Committee to speak with banks and institutional investors in order to
improve the FIP system.
• TAKEAWAY: In theory, the FIP incentivizes investment as players are rewarded with higher returns depending
on how their business models cope with electricity price volatility. This makes the power market more efficient

as segmented renewable sectors integrate into a single power market. Tools to forecast FIP income are
provided on ANRE’s website. On the other hand, there has been no wind project financed with FIP and it’s
been a struggle for on-going projects too.



Private sector requests state funding for CCS
(Japan NRG, Oct. 31)
•  19 companies and associations, including trading houses, shipping companies and energy
associations, requested METI state-funding for capital expenditure and to cover running costs of
future carbon capture and storage projects.
•  Japan CCS Co. urged a quick setup of CCS regulatory framework and to avoid overlap in

regulations between the central government and municipalities.
•  A study by the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) showed that at least
¥400 billion would be required for capturing, transporting and storing 1 million tons/ year of
carbon.
•  CONTEXT: METI solicited the CCS Costs and Implementation Working Group members to put
forward requests.
• TAKEAWAY: The RITE study highlighted that the origin of carbon - from coal, LNG or hydrogen production –

will have a major impact on costs.


ANRE proposes publishing data of companies with best energy saving practices

(Japan NRG, Nov. 2)
•  ANRE proposes to publish on METI’s website the energy data of companies that achieved “S”, the
highest rating for energy saving practices.
•  Every year, ANRE rates companies in four categories: “S” (energy saving is excellent), “A”
(general), “B” (stagnation) and “C” (requires work). There are about 10,000 companies rated “S”,
and they can be found on ANRE’s website.
•  ANRE will disclose company names and energy data, provided they give consent. Major disclosure

items are energy efficiency data, the use of demand response power systems, and shifts to non-
fossil power.
•  CONTEXT: Following the Energy Conservation Act amendments in May, large energy consumers
are to report shifts to renewables and demand response systems, in addition to energy efficiency
data. Companies receiving an “S” last year include Tokyo Electric Power Grid and Nansei Sekiyu.

• TAKEAWAY: The Petroleum Association of Japan said it was a shame that ANRE’s energy saving measurement
system doesn’t reflect efforts to cut SCOPE-3 emissions.



Energy Conservation Center calls to promote atmospheric heat as renewable energy
(Japan NRG, Nov. 2)
•  The Energy Conservation Center Japan (ECCJ) urged ANRE to promote atmospheric heat as a
renewable energy source by establishing a methodology to measure it, and subsequently include it

in energy statistics.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese energy regulations didn’t provide a clear definition of atmospheric heat until
the recent changes to the Energy Conservation Act defined it as “energy”.


Japan leads in sustainable concrete technologies: METI

(Japan NRG, Nov. 2)
•  METI reported that Japanese sustainable concrete technologies are leading its overseas peers with
higher carbon reduction and capture values.
•  CO2 Suicom, jointly developed by Kashima, Chugoku Electric and Denka, posted a carbon
reduction of 306 kg/ m2 and carbon capture of 109 kg/ m3, which was over ten times more than
the figures of a Canadian competitor.
•  The govt will promote sustainable concrete at the 2025 Osaka Pavilion, and plans to include it in
the offset credit mechanism.



Itochu to import ‘neat SAF’ and establish blending supply chain
(Company statement Nov. 1)
•  Trading house Itochu Corp was selected by the Civil Aviation Bureau for its "Imported Neat SAF
Model Project".
•  In a first for Japan, Itochu will import neat SAF (a jet fuel produced with biomass materials, and

blended with a certain percentage of fossil-based jet fuel) from Neste. It will demonstrate blending
of neat SAF with conventional fossil jet fuel, as well as certification of blended SAF with Fuji Oil.

ENEOS-led group seeks to develop Hokkaido green hydrogen supply chain
(New Energy Business News, Nov. 2)
•  ENEOS, JFE Engineering, Deloitte, Hokkaido Electric and the Hokkaido grid company won state
backing to create a large-scale green hydrogen supply chain project on Japan’s northernmost isle.

•  The five companies have NEDO backing for a research project until Sept 2023 that will investigate
creating a green hydrogen supply chain in Hokkaido’s Tomakomai region. Initial ideas center on
deploying 100 MW class electrolyzers to produce about 10,000 tons of green hydrogen annually.
•  CONTEXT: Hokkaido is rich in renewable energy resources such as solar and wind, but local
demand for electricity in Hokkaido is limited. Hydrogen is seen as one way to deliver energy from
Hokkaido to high-demand areas in Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: An analysis of surplus renewable energy used to generate hydrogen is in the Feb. 21, 2022 Japan

NRG issue. An analysis about electrolyzer use to balance the local grid is in the Aug. 1, 2022 Japan NRG issue.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JX and Mizuho to test hydrogen production from biomass also using CCS

chargers at a low cost.



IHI creates CO2 traceability and origin labeling system for ammonia
(Kankyo Business, Nov. 2)
•  Engineering major IHI created a CO2 traceability platform for ammonia that tracks emissions from
ammonia production to utilization by using blockchain.
•  The system calculates, records, and visualizes CO2 emissions at each stage of ammonia
production, transportation, storage, and use. This enables both sellers and buyers to prove their

CO2 emissions and any reductions to stakeholders seeking info on their decarbonization efforts.
•  The company started a demo test to verify the calculation method and improve the platform’s
functionality.


U.S. energy official says Japan could be an export destination for hydrogen

(Asia Nikkei, Oct. 29)
•  David Crane, the nominee for U.S. undersecretary of energy, said that plans to develop $7 billion
in hydrogen production infrastructure in the U.S. could benefit Japan as an importer of the fuel.
•  The U.S. would like to cooperate with Japan on hydrogen and ammonia projects and would
welcome Japanese investment, Crane said.
•  Companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries might be interested.
•  CONTEXT: Crane is in the process of Congressional approval. He’s a former director at JERA.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  METI’s Innovative Reactor Working Group in the Nuclear Energy Subcommittee is concerned that
the number of businessmen and students interested in nuclear energy has been declining.
Sufficient human resources for nuclear energy is imperative in the development of new innovative
reactors.
•  Many nuclear business suppliers have suffered from a sharp decline in orders, and suppliers must

scale back or close operations.
• TAKEAWAY: There was a big drop-off in interest among younger people in studying nuclear power generation
after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Securing proper human resources to drive innovation in nuclear sector
technologies is a major challenge for the government.




Japan’s empty villages are a warning for China
(FT, Nov. 30)
•  Nomura Research Institute predicts that Japan will have about 11 million unoccupied residences,
and up to one-third of Japan’s homes might be empty.
•  According to Jefferies, China now faces this demographic issue – how to avoid the same property

crisis that Japan experienced. Jefferies stresses the strong resemblance between those two
countries.
•  For example, the ratio of children born to unmarried couples for both Japan or China is very low,
about 3%; compared with 60% in major western countries.
• TAKEAWAY: While both Japan and China must grapple with negative demographics, the paper, “Population
Decrease and Electricity Demand / Myth and Reality” by Akira Yanagisawa, argues that while population has

been decreasing steeply, even in already depopulated areas such as Hokkaido, Tohoku, Chugoku, Kyushu and
Okinawa, electricity demand is more impacted by lifestyle than population numbers. For this reason, demand
for new energy infrastructure, including renewables, might not decline in line with a fall in population.

The NRA to remove age limit on operation of nuclear reactors
(Sankei Shimbun, Nov. 2)
•  The NRA will abolish the 60-years operation limit for nuclear reactors. But it will require approval
for every 10 years, starting 30 years after operational start.
•  Currently, utilities need approval for an extension before a reactor turns 40 years old. Therefore,

power companies must get approval 10 years earlier. Now, with this decision, Japanese companies
can operate NPPs for 70 or 80 years, like in the U.S.
•  The NRA will decide the details of this issue by the end of 2022.
• TAKEAWAY: After the Fukushima disaster in 2011, all nuclear reactors had to cease operations, even if they
had no problems at all. For example, Chubu Electric hasn’t operated units 3, 4 and 5 of its Hamaoka NPP (total
output 3.5 GW) for more than 10 years. Therefore, the NRA’s decision can be seen as a way to compensate
utilities for the “lost” 10+ years. See last week’s Analysis section for a detailed overview of this situation.



Government to ask citizens, businesses to conserve power starting December

(NHK, Oct. 31)
•  Due to the energy crisis, the govt plans to ask households and businesses to cut electricity use
between December and March.
•  While the country has enough capacity to generate sufficient electricity, the cost of fuel is at a
record high.
•  CONTEXT: In summer, the government asked for energy conservation and electricity use was
significantly cut on certain days.




Winter power forecast improves, but METI to closely monitor supply demand balance
(Japan NRG, Nov. 1)
•  METI said the power reserve rate from December to February is holding above 4% for all areas,
including Tokyo, and which previously was forecast to be in a deficit of 0.6% in January and 0.5%
in February.
•  At least nine nuclear plants will be operational during the winter months, as construction work

schedules were pushed forward.
•  METI will continue to monitor supply side factors such as available power generation capacities,
fuel and non-fossil power sources, as well as drive energy conservation by spreading demand
response systems among businesses.
•  Government buildings will be kept at 19°C and all lighting systems will be replaced by light-
emitting diodes (LED) by 2030.

Chugoku Electric starts first new thermal power plant in 22 years
(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 2)
•  Chugoku Electric started Unit 2 of the Misumi coal-fired power plant. Together with Unit 1,
Misumi’s output is 2 GW.

•  As Unit 2’s power generation efficiency reaches 43.3%, fuel costs will drop significantly. And as
woody biomass will account for 10% of the fuel, CO2 emissions should also be reduced.
•  The plant was delivered by MHI. For Chugoku Electric, Misumi Unit 2 is the first thermal power
plant to open in 22 years.
• TAKEAWAY: While 10 nuclear reactors, with total output of 9.96 GW, have restarted in Western Japan,
Chugoku, Hokuriku and Chubu Electric which use a different reactor tech have yet to restart a single one.

Misumi’s Unit 2 will replace costly, older gas and oil power plants and help improve Chugoku Electric’s
finances.


TEPCO may raise regulated power rates for first time since 2012

(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 2)
•  TEPCO Holdings and TEPCO Energy Partner said that due to soaring fuel prices, high JEPX
electricity prices, and a steeply weakening yen, their financial situation is worsening rapidly.
•  According to 2022 midterm results, TEPCO had its first loss for an interim period because TEPCO
EP must sell electricity lower than the purchasing price.
•  To make matters worse, TEPCO needs to supply electricity for old customers who once switched

to a PPS but then returned after their PPS went bankrupt.
•  CONTEXT: For the first time since 2012, TEPCO wants to raise regulated rates for low-voltage
customers, which tend to be households.
• TAKEAWAY: Recently, other regional power companies also announced price hikes, for the same reasons as
TEPCO. They first suffered by losing customers, then competing with PPSs, and now suffer from returning
customers. A verification for the result of electricity deregulation would be needed.



Power operators to trial VPP based on household storage batteries

(New Energy Business News, Nov. 1)
•  A number of power companies including Shizen Energy and Minna Denryoku will join with Tokyo
Gas and battery manufacturers including GridShare Japan to set up a virtual power plant (VPP)
based on residential energy storage batteries.
•  The group plans to recruit 700 households to participate, which would be equivalent to about
2,200 kW of regulated power, and begin a trial in mid-December. Shizen Energy will serve as the
VPP aggregator and use its Shizen Connect energy management system.
•  The VPP will remotely control residential storage batteries to balance out local power supply and

demand, and verify the impact on grid balancing and electricity cost.
•  CONTEXT: This is Japan's largest VPP demo using household energy resources.

Toyota and JERA launch the world’s first large-capacity sweep energy storage system
(Company statement, Oct. 27)
•  JERA and Toyota launched the world’s first large-capacity sweep energy storage system, a way to
use old vehicle batteries of varying size and output, in tandem.

•  The system was built using batteries reclaimed from EVs (HEV, PHEV, BEV, FCEV) and is connected
to the consumer electrical power grid. Toyota’s sweep function can freely control energy discharge
by switching electricity flow on and off through series-connected batteries.












•  The storage system will be connected to the Chubu Electric Power Grid and installed at JERA’s
Yokkaichi thermal power plant.
•  The sweep function enables direct AC output from the batteries. That helps to reduce costs and
avoid power loss when converting from AC to DC.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite high demand for batteries, insufficient supply of raw materials is a major challenge.

Reusing older car batteries for power storage also addresses environmental considerations.


TEPCO acquires Scotland’s Flotation Energy

(Company statement, Nov. 2)
•  Edinburgh-based Flotation Energy will be acquired by TEPCO Group.
•  Flotation is a pioneer in floating offshore wind and it developed Kincardine, the world’s largest

Japan will remain in Sakhalin-1 after Russia changes ownership to local entity
(Asia Nikkei, Oct. 31)
•  The govt decided that Japan will remain a stakeholder in Russia’s Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project
even after Exxon’s exit. Russia is moving the assets from the current operating company to a new,
locally registered entity set up last month.
•  Russia gave current Sakhalin-1 shareholders a month to decide whether to invest in the new entity.

A Japanese state-backed consortium owns 30% of the current company.
•  Exxon said earlier this year it would leave the project. A unit of Russia’s state-run oil major, Rosneft,
will take over as project leader. India’s state firm ONGC also owns 20% of Sakhalin-1.
• TAKEAWAY: Production at Sakhalin-1 has almost ground to a halt and Japan stopped buying its oil. However,
the project is the fruit of decades of Japanese investment and Tokyo doesn’t want to lose ownership. It does
leave Japanese investors in a precarious position, but a risk that the government believes is worth taking.

LNG stocks slip to 2.5 million tons
(Government data, Nov. 2)
•  LNG stocks of 10 power grids stood at 2.5 million tons as of Oct. 30, down from 2.55 million tons a
week earlier. The Oct. 30 stocks were first reported as 2.56 million tons, but were revised. The end-

October stocks last year were 2.07 million tons. The five-year average for this time of year is 1.84
million tons.



Idemitsu makes second vanadium investment into Australia’s Vecco

(Japan NRG, Oct. 26)
•  Idemitsu acquired a stake in Vecco Group that’s developing the Debella vanadium mine in
Queensland. Vecco also runs a refinery to produce vanadium electrolyte for redox flow storage
batteries.
•  Idemitsu didn’t disclose the investment amount.
•  CONTEXT: The move follows Idemitsu in September taking a 32.22% share of Critical Minerals
Group, also an Australian exploration company focused on vanadium.
• TAKEAWAY: The price of vanadium surged following Russia’s invasion on fear of supply cuts, but eased in

recent months. Historically, the vanadium price has been volatile, going up and down in short cycles, which
discourages the use of redox flow batteries.

Japan Ready to Talk Carbon Trading at COP27
COP27 kicks off in Egypt this week. Some participants have come to talk about policy;
others to bemoan geopolitics; and more than a few to argue over the validity of
various climate actions. Japan, however, will be there primarily to do business.

Of course, the nature of the business is very much linked to climate and the ways in
which Japan can meet its agreed GHG emission cuts. Tokyo’s primary goal at the UN
climate change conference, which officially opened on Nov. 6, will be to help craft an
international framework for the cross-border trading of emissions credits.

Japan has worked on such a framework ever since the basis of such trading, Article 6
of the Paris Agreement, was ratified at last year’s COP26 in Glasgow. Also, Tokyo
recently launched a domestic carbon trading exchange, albeit on a trial basis.

Should carbon trading mechanisms align across many countries, it would incentivize
investment in decarbonization in lower cost geographies, potentially creating better
efficiencies and providing funds for green solutions in developing economies. Such an
international approach could create an export market for Japanese decarbonization
tech, while also locking in emissions cuts as a business procedure.


Separate national markets
A sore point for COP participants from developing economies over recent years is the
lack of progress in promises by wealthier countries to adhere to Articles 2 and 9 of the
2015 Paris Agreement. The former vows to set aside adequate financial flows for
emission reduction pathways, while the latter says developed countries have a
responsibility to provide financial assistance to developing economies.

From a Japanese perspective, the solution lies in another article, No. 6, which allows
for the creation, exchange and trading of credits based on GHG emission reductions
among member countries. For every 1 ton of CO2 emissions reduced intentionally,
the acting party can claim a credit. Further, under Article 6 a country is allowed to
transfer credits earned from cutting emissions to help other countries meet their
climate targets.

At present, the trading of carbon credits is segregated in over a dozen separate
national and regional markets from California to New Zealand. Among the largest is
the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which was worth €683
billion ($678 billion) at the end of 2021.

The quality and configurations of credits varies significantly between markets. This is
one of the issues that Japan and over 30 countries and international organizations
would like to standardize during COP27.

In theory, this opens the potential for developing nations to attract funding for climate
reduction measures due to a lower cost base. In addition, they would gain access to
cleaner and more efficient tech to improve the local economy’s competitiveness. For
developed economies, this potentially lowers the overall cost associated with cutting

CO2 volumes and opens new markets for green tech.

If the trade is fully implemented, Japan estimates the size of the market for climate
tech could be worth ¥20 trillion and emissions could be cut by 9 billion tons of CO2
equivalent per year, or 30% of the world's total, within this decade.


Sharing is caring
Commoditizing credits has greater implications when the value can be transferred
across countries. This concept is something that Japan has worked on for many years.
In fact, Japan pioneered the idea that credit values can be shared when the GHG
reduction is made possible by an overseas party.

In 2013, Japan launched a bilateral credit-sharing system, known as the Joint
Crediting Mechanism (JCM). Last month, it welcomed Uzbekistan as the 24th nation
state member of the system. Most JCM members are in Asia and Africa, as well as
Central and South America.

Since launch, more than 200 projects have been implemented, including support for
the introduction of renewable energy generation. In each case, one condition is that
the project that wins JCM approval must involve at least one Japanese company.

Example: in Bac Ninh Province, Vietnam, JFE Engineering, a major Japanese plant
builder, and others are building a large-scale waste-to-energy facility to incinerate 500
tons of waste per day and use the heat to generate electricity. All without using fossil
fuels. The project is expected to cut annual CO2 emissions by about 41,800 tons. A
portion of this will be credited to the Japanese side.


The impact of instability and war
A preparatory meeting for the new credit trading framework, currently known as the
“Paris Agreement Article 6 Implementation Partnership,” was held in the Kanagawa
Prefecture in September. In attendance were 19 countries and regions, including the
UK, EU, Germany, India, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, Korea, Singapore, and Gambia.
Also, 14 international organizations such as the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank took part.

Asked about Tokyo’s top priority for COP27, a Japanese official told Japan NRG that
the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia have greatly impacted many parts of
the world.

“One factor that's deeply intertwined with climate change-related initiatives is the
instability in the energy market. During the summit we’d be very glad to reaffirm the
solidarity within the international community regarding the need to take climate
countermeasures”.

The official stressed that while adhering to the timelines set during COP26, talks in
Egypt should proceed in “a well-balanced manner,” covering both adaptation and
mitigation, and taking into account the recent loss and damage in the global system.

With the G7 summit to be held in Hiroshima next July, the Kishida government is
anxious to leave a mark at COP27 and connect it with next year’s event. “We pay
attention to this connection”, another Japanese official said.


Can the international community be unified?
As it looks to future editions of the COP series, Japan is expected to work with the
United Arab Emirates (host of COP28), and India (the G20 host), to help unify the
international community and lead global efforts toward net-zero in 2050.

The reaction in some Japanese media ahead of COP27 was that the country should
do more. Yet, despite making a keynote speech at COP26, Prime Minister Kishida has
yet to announce his plans to attend on the eve of the event. In contrast, Tokyo
Governor Koike Yuriko, who studied in the summit’s host country, plans to go and
showcase the metropolitan government's measures against climate change.

While the Japanese COP27 delegation will seek to steer the agenda on public climate
financing, officials will be wary of what the private actors say. European companies
have traditionally led the debate on private funding for decarbonization, and in the
process taken positions that officials in Asia disagree with.

One of the biggest outcomes of last year’s summit was the creation of the Glasgow
Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a group of global financiers led by former
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. This time, the group is expected to discuss
global green investment standards, especially what can be deemed as acceptable
energy transition pathways.

With global financial standards likely to impact Japanese firms, Tokyo’s
representatives in Egypt will be keen to support the consensus, but avoid a detailed
and prescriptive approach that may clash with the realities faced by Asian economies.

Upgrading Japan’s Ports for Offshore Wind Power
Brings a New Set of Challenges

Building offshore wind power generation capacity counts among the greatest modern
marvels. Each year, across the globe, hundreds of wind turbines are installed in
coastal waters as part of the effort to achieve zero carbon energy goals by 2050.

Installing such capacity isn’t only about finding advantageous locations, or procuring
turbines and support structures. It’s also necessary to secure, upgrade, and develop
vital infrastructure such as vessels to tow the turbines, and ports where the turbines
and equipment are stored, assembled and transported, and maintenance work done.

Japan’s target to add 45 GW of offshore wind by 2040 is ambitious for a country
where renewable energy development has been mainly led by solar power in recent
years. As of June, Japan has 4.7 GW of wind capacity, of which a measly 52 MW lies
offshore. That pales in comparison with 66 GW of solar across the country.

The government is betting on Japan’s natural geographical advantage – some of the
world’s longest coast lines – to provide substantial electricity volumes from wind
generation. In recent years, a new law has been passed and existing ones updated.
For example, revisions to the Port and Harbor Act have been made to promote
offshore wind projects near ports.

While this is positive news, it’s just the start of a long road of work ahead. Required
specifications for suitable ports – such as the water depth and ground bearing
capacity – will have to be surveyed and will vary depending on the types of
foundations (spar, barge, and semi-submersible) that are still in pilot projects.

Building offshore wind generation capacity is certainly a titanic challenge for any
country, but the effort to tackle those issues carry the potential for dramatic
transformation among many sectors of the national economy. This in turn means even
more opportunity to stimulate more economic activity and job creation.


Offshore Wind Ports
Since April 2019, Japan has allowed offshore wind projects to operate for up to 30
years within 12 nautical miles (about 22 km) in the government’s so-called “promotion
zones”, of which there are now eight. In September 2020, the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure and Transportation (MLIT) designated four ports for offshore wind
usage. This now allows wind developers to rent the necessary port space for up to 30
years.

Ports are crucial because they’re used for the assembly of parts, operation and
maintenance work, not to mention that wind turbines and other equipment are
transported from there. The port of Akita is ahead of others in strengthening
infrastructure, including its ground bearing capacity increased to 35 t/m², much
stronger than the 3 t/m² that’s the average for most ports.

The MLIT, which plans to designate more offshore wind ports, published a report in
February describing suitable specifications for future ports. Some key points are:

Larger turbines and projects: In Europe, in 2020, the average sizes of a turbine and an
offshore wind project were 8.2 MW and 788 MW, respectively. The chart below shows
specifications for a 10 MW turbine and estimates for a 15 MW and a 20 MW turbine
still being developed.

10 MW             15 MW              20 MW

Weight     About 2,100 tons  About 3,100 tons   About 4,200 tons
Height      186 ~ 215 m        244 ~ 258 m         300 m

Width       164 ~ 193 m        222 ~ 236 m         280 m

Source: MLIT
A 20 MW wind turbine would stand 300-meter tall and weigh 4,200 tons, including its
monopile foundation. That’s twice as tall as the 4.2 MW turbines installed for two
projects expected to start operations soon near Akita and Noshiro ports.

Large vessels: Japan’s Obayashi and Penta-Ocean are building jack-up barges, to be
operational next year. Blue Wind, which was built for Japanese construction company
Shimizu and is one of the world's largest jack-up vessels, has been completed. Its
crane has a maximum lifting capacity of 2,500 tons and a maximum lifting height of
158 meters, which can be used for installing the foundation and assembling
components for 14–15 MW turbines.

Number of ports: The MLIT studied how many ports are needed to install 45 GW of
offshore wind by 2040, and has divided the country into three areas: 1)
Hokkaido/Tohoku/Hokuriku; 2) Tokyo/Chubu/Kansai; and 3) Chugoku, Shikoku,
Kyushu.

Aside from the four existing ports, Japan will need as many as 15 ports to service its
offshore wind sector. In September, in response to a MLIT survey, several ports said
they are willing to be designated as ‘offshore wind ports’. But two areas – 1)
Tokyo/Chubu/Kansai and 2) Chugoku/Shikoku/Kyushu – were short of enough
candidates.

The ministry’s estimates are based on the model capacity of 500 MW per promotion
zone. The Japan Wind Power Association thinks that future projects could be twice as
large.

Floating offshore wind: Another element that could change the requirements for
future offshore wind ports is an expansion of floating offshore wind turbines. While
most projects in the pipeline will use turbines fixed to the ocean bottom, there’s
growing interest in setting turbines on floating structures installed in deep waters with
higher wind potential.

In Japan, floating offshore wind has a potential of 424 GW, more than three times that
of projects with fixed-bottom turbines, according to the JWPA. While floating turbines
installed further offshore can take advantage of strong winds in deeper oceans, their
foundations tend to be larger, and up to 10 times heavier than the monopile
substructure for bottom-fixed turbines, according to the MLIT.

As future projects will likely be built much further out in the ocean, the government
has begun looking into expanding development beyond Japan’s territorial waters.
The Cabinet Office held its first meeting on Oct. 6 to discuss international law related
to offshore wind projects in Japan’s Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ).

While territorial waters – the current outer limit for Japan’s offshore wind projects - are
12 nautical miles (about 22 km) from the coastline, the EEZ extends 200 nautical miles
from the coastline (about 370 km). Available area will dramatically expand and
opportunities for floating offshore wind farms will multiply. This means that service
vessels will need to travel a much longer distance to reach those sites.

Any final decision on a possible foundation for wind turbines will only be made when
the developer has won an auction. This means that port development needs to be

conducted in a timely manner while ensuring extra room for future upgrades, the
JWPA said.

Furthermore, some of Japan’s offshore wind ports are also expected to function as
“carbon neutral ports (CNP).” The government wants to reduce port emissions by
building facilities to import and store hydrogen and fuel ammonia, and introduce
zero-emission cargo handling equipment, vessels and trucks. There are also plans to
decarbonize industries in port areas such as using hydrogen at steel plants and mixing
fuel ammonia at thermal power plants.

About two dozen ports that have the potential to become CNP include two offshore
wind ports – Kitakyushu and Kashima.

Also, the JWPA says that the optimal number of ports of the appropriate size is
needed so that they won’t later end as excess or idle facilities. That’s crucial because
the cost of port upgrade work will be covered by the power generators in the form of
port use fees (貸付料).

For example, the fee to use Kashima Port is ¥11.5 billion (¥5.5 billion to the central
government and the rest to Ibaraki prefecture) to be paid by all developers that use
the port in coming years.

The JWPA wants to see large-size ports that can allow for multiple projects
simultaneously, and that each port will ideally have the capacity to accommodate 1
GW of offshore wind construction and maintenance work per year allowing multiple
developers to use the space.

Now and in the coming years, Japan will have to invest significantly in port
development. Without such investment, the country’s ambitious plan to develop
offshore wind power might just be dead in the water. While Japan’s rollout of public
tenders to develop offshore areas for wind power generation has been much slower
than many expected, the additional time should help the country prepare the
infrastructure in such a way that makes future project development move with much
more speed.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Argentina/ Natural gas
The EU plans to sign an MoU with Argentina "soon," as part of efforts to tackle
energy supply shortages. Argentina has one of the world's largest reserves of natural
gas and is looking for new investments to increase exports.

EU/ Renewables
EIB Group, which consists of the European Investment Bank and European Investment
Fund - will mobilize up to €115 billion by 2027 to invest in renewables, energy
efficiency, grids and storage, as well as EV charging infrastructure.

EU/ Energy crisis
Energy-intensive industries, such as aluminium, fertilisers, and chemicals are at risk of
permanently shifting production to locations plentiful in cheap energy, such as the
U.S., where natural gas costs only about a fifth of EU rates. Moreover, 17% of German
auto sector companies plan to move some production abroad.

Finland/ Nuclear power
Small cracks were found in all four feedwater pumps of the Olkiluoto 3 (OL3) nuclear
reactor. The damage to Europe's largest nuclear reactor is a major setback. Power
blackouts in winter are possible if OL3 doesn’t supply electricity. Under construction
since 2005, OL3 was originally planned to start operation in 2009.

Germany/ Natural gas
Uniper reported a €40 billion loss in the first nine months of the year, one of the
biggest in corporate history. This compares to a €4.7 billion loss in the same period
for 2021. Once Europe’s largest importer of Russian gas, Uniper has been hard hit by
the war in Ukraine, with its shares having plunged nearly 93% this year.

Italy/ Natural gas
The new government plans to double national gas production to 6 bcm/ year. Rome
will also authorize new offshore drilling in the Adriatic Sea as part of plans to become
“the energy hub of the Mediterranean”, said Industry Minister Adolfo Urso.

Russia/ Nord Stream attack
Moscow officially accused the British Navy of carrying out attacks on the Nord Stream
undersea gas pipelines deep in NATO waters, off the coast of Poland. The Kremlin
said “we will think about further steps; it definitely can’t be left like this.”

UAE/ Renewables
Renewable energy company Masdar acquired UK-based battery energy storage
system (BESS) developer, Arlington Energy. The acquisition allows Masdar to expand
its presence in the UK and EU renewable energy markets.

Vietnam/ Coal power
Vietnam and Indonesia will be given cash offers of around $5 billion and $10 billion,
respectively, to reduce coal usage. Both Indonesia and Vietnam rely heavily on coal-
fired power generation and it’s unclear what sources could replace this.

UK/ Wind power
The UK’s onshore and offshore wind farms generated more than 20 GW yesterday,
setting a new record, reported the National Grid ESO. This was 53% of the UK’s
electricity. Overall yesterday, wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, and storage provided 70% of
the UK’s electricity.

U.S./ Energy crisis
President Biden will spend $13.5 billion to help low-income households pay heating
bills this winter. Due to surging fuel costs and colder weather, U.S. consumers can
expect to pay up to 28% more to heat their homes this winter than last year.
