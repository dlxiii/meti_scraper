NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Kishida, Biden deepen security ties, seek new synergies in energy transition

(Government statement, April 10)
•  The Kishida-Biden summit talks in Washington deepened energy security ties:
o  They launched the bilateral Strategic Partnership to Accelerate Fusion Energy
Demonstration and Commercialization;
o  The U.S. will continue to support allied energy security with LNG supplies;
o  Collaborate on critical mineral projects;
o  They will increase supply of SAF and ethanol feedstock;

•  The leaders expressed concerns over China’s activities in the South China Sea and efforts to
disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploration that are not compliant to the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea.
• TAKEAWAY: The bilateral commitment to SAF and ethanol feedstock growth was toned down compared to
the 2022 joint statement that said Japan plans to double bioethanol demand by 2030. The statements on
China’s activities in the South China Sea and critical mineral supplies were more or less similar.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kishida, Biden, Marcos hold trilateral summit
(Government statement, April 11)
o  Kishida, Biden and Philippine President Marcos held their first summit to discuss:

▪  Enhancing supply chains for critical minerals and semiconductors,
▪  Cooperation in civil nuclear energy and other clean energy.
o  Industrial ministers from the three countries met separately to discuss critical mineral
supply chains, clean energy and infrastructure development.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan, U.S. to seek cooperation in GX Strategy and IRA
(Government statement, April 11)
o  METI Minister Saito spoke with the U.S. Presidential senior advisor John Podesta in
Washington D.C. to seek synergies between the GX Promotion Strategy and the Inflation
Reduction Act.

MLIT to designate Aomori and Sakata ports as offshore wind hubs
(Government statement, April 8)
•  MLIT designated Aomori and Sakata ports as logistical hubs for offshore wind and other
renewables projects.
•  A total of ¥120 billion will be equally allocated for reconstruction work that includes strengthening

the ground near quays, developing berths to accommodate cargo ships and SEP vessels.
•  Aomori Port, which is expected to service the Sea of Japan’s southern area, was selected for
offshore wind power (600 MW) in the Round 3 auction.
•  Sakata Port will support a 450 MW wind power project off Yusa Town’s coast for Round 3. The port
is the main maritime logistics hub of Yamagata Pref.
•  CONTEXT: Sites designated as ‘base ports’ can be leased to power companies for 30 years. Japan

has five such port areas – Akita and Noshiro (Akita Pref), Kashima (Ibaraki Pref), Kitakyushu
(Fukuoka Pref) and Niigata (Niigata Pref). Aomori port is an important base for goods and
passenger transport, with about a quarter of the ferry traffic between Honshu and Hokkaido.



Green Innovation Fund doubles next-gen aircraft project funding

(Government statement, April 9)
•  NEDO awarded projects for developing next-gen aircraft to four companies; funding will come
from the Green Innovation Fund (GIF) and be dispensed over FY2024 to FY2030.
•  GIF will provide ¥30.6 billion in total, in addition to the ¥21 billion granted to five projects in 2021.
•  The new projects are:
o  Developing a 4 MW hydrogen fuel cell-based propulsion system – IHI Aerospace

o  Heat resistant, high strength hydrogen fuel cell systems – Toray
o  Air and heat management systems for electric airplanes – IHI
o  Improving electrification efficiencies – Tamagawa Seiki
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI panel releases long-term aviation strategy
(Government statement, April 9)
o  The aviation industry is witnessing a paradigm shift amid climate change, digitalization,

the need to boost resilience, etc. This opens up opportunities for Japanese businesses,
said an aviation and space industry sub-committee.
o  Japanese firms need to evolve: develop a capability to integrate input from various
parties, rather than being a single component supplier. Such capability will allow global
players to choose Japan as the site of aircraft assembly plants.




MoE suspends research work with REI over Chinese logo scandal
(Japan NRG, April 10)
•  The MoE suspended the Renewable Energy Institute (REI) as one of its official research centers
amid growing public concerns over possible illicit connections with China.

•  At an April 9 meeting in the Diet, Environment Minister Ito said it will cease using the institute as
an advisory body.
5



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: It recently emerged that a REI official filed presentations to govt agencies that
contained the logo of a Chinese state-owned power firm. REI says the use of the logo was an IT
mishap and entirely accidental; an investigation is ongoing.
•  Questions were raised that REI may be pushing China’s agenda, steering Japan’s energy policy to
incorporate the strategies of its neighbor.
•  Several REI members also served on a Cabinet Office-appointed energy task force.

•  CONTEXT: Last month, it became known that REI used, on various occasions, documents
containing the China State Grid’s watermark. The mishap has raised questions over whether what
REI calls “an IT error” had any impact on regulations, including the MoE’s stance on carbon
pricing. Ito denied any foreign govt influence on decisions regarding carbon pricing and other
policies.




NYK to issue transition bonds and green bonds this month
(Company statement, April 10)
•  This month, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) will issue its No. 47 transition bonds and its No. 48 green
bonds. This marks NYK's second green bond issuance since May 2018, and its third transition bond

issuance since July 2023.
•  The funds raised will be used for projects such as LNG-fueled vessels. Proceeds from the green
bonds will go towards projects such as development of ammonia-fueled vessels. The latter will be
built with help from the Green Innovation Fund.
•  The maturity period is five years for transition bonds and 10 years for green bonds. The largest
issue is ¥200 billion for transition bonds, and ¥100 billion for green bonds.
•  DNV Business Assurance Japan K.K provides a second-party opinion on NYK's financial framework

and the use of proceeds.
•  CONTEXT: NYK issued the first green bonds in the shipping industry in 2018, and Japan's first
transition bonds in 2021.
• TAKEAWAY: LNG-fueled vessels are seen as low-carbon, intermediate solutions on the path to developing
zero-emission ships. Thus, funding through transition bonds is an option. The conversion of vessels from
running on LNG fuel to ammonia fuel requires extra costs and modification of ship tanks and ventilation

systems. Thus the two bond categories can be said to work together, offering different scopes but connected
by a single trend narrative.




Sekisui begins study of floating perovskite PV that lacks water-proofing
(Japan NRG, April 9)
•  On April 3, Sekisui Chemical, in conjunction with engineering consultancy MM Bridge and solar
power operator Koei-Densetsu, began testing floating perovskite solar cell (PSC) modules that lack
any water-proofing.
•  This is Japan’s first floating PSC study. The panels were installed in an old school swimming pool.

The study will run for one year.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: All power systems and batteries, notably PSCs, are vulnerable to moisture. In this
study, the PSC panels are floated on water without protection to identify any challenges, as well as
their potential. This is Sekisui’s first collaboration with a solar power operator.
• TAKEAWAY: Many solar operators are looking for offshore potential since Japan has limited land. However,
commercializing a floating PSC system may be more challenging than PSC-integrated buildings, due to

difficulties maintaining systems on water and direct exposure to moisture.




World’s first ammonia-fueled ship to sail near Yokohama
(Japan NRG, April 11)
•  Sakigake, the world’s first ammonia-fueled ship, will sail from Yokohama in June. Sakigake is a
tugboat (272 tons) owned by NYK Lines.
•  The boat was originally a LNG-fueled vessel, which was converted to ammonia specifications by IHI
Power Systems. Marine diesel oil (grade-A heavy oil) will be used to ignite the four-stroke engine

but the boat will be fueled entirely by ammonia.
•  Sakigake’s crew will be two or three people.
• TAKEAWAY: Ammonia lags behind methanol in the race to replace fossil ship fuel. The world’s first methanol-
fueled vessel was built in Europe in 2023. Japan’s first methanol ship will be delivered to Nihon Shipyard in
2026.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
K Line, MAN, Nihon Shipyard ink MoU to develop ammonia-fueled ship
(Company statement, April 11)
o  Kawasaki Kisan Kaisha, Itochu, Nihon Shipyard, MAN Energy Solutions, Mitsui E&S, and
NS United Kaiun Kaisha inked a MoU to develop ammonia-fueled ships.

•  MOL is working on the ship design and has yet to decide whether to carry water for electrolysis on
the ship or process seawater on board.
•  CONTEXT: The company built a pilot ship by converting a yacht carrying electrolysis-ready water

supplies and metal hydride plates to store hydrogen.



Govt to standardize hydrogen train safety rules

(Nikkei, April 10)
•  METI and MLIT will standardize hydrogen safety rules for trains; METI has oversight on gas storage,
while MLIT has on transport systems.
•  MLIT will set up an expert committee to rewrite the rules.
•  CONTEXT: JR East plans to commercialize a hybrid fuel cell train service by 2030. Other railway
operators plan to start testing small fuel cell systems this year, first at construction sites and then
on board trains.




ENEOS, Haneda airport aim for hydrogen energy system
(Japan NRG, April 10)
•  ENEOS and Japan Airport Terminal Co inked a partnership to study the use of hydrogen
cogeneration systems at the passenger terminal. They’ll also explore a hydrogen supply base in

the Keihin coastal area.
•  They’ll assess if a 100% hydrogen-fueled system, to supply both heat and electricity, is practical. If
all goes well, then such a system could be operational by 2030.
•  If there are technical challenges, then hydrogen will be mixed with other fuel.




Suntory makes whiskey using hydrogen-fueled distillation system
(Company statement, April 11)

NEWS:     ELECTRICITY       MARKETS






Electricity consumption may increase 40% by 2050 due to expansion of generative AI

(Nikkei, April 11)
•  The latest predictions of Japan’s data consumption show a nearly 40% rise by 2050 due to the
growing use of generative AI, which requires a large amount of data storage. This could
significantly impact Japan’s decarbonization strategy.
•  CRIEPI, a think-tank, predicts that Japan's electricity consumption will increase 37% in 50 years,
from over 924 GWh in 2021. RITE’s estimates also show up to a 30% increase by 2050 over 2019,
mainly due to generative AI use.
•  CRIEPI drafted three scenarios for estimates of electricity required for data centers:

o  The demand for data centers will increase more than tenfold, and the amount of
electricity will need to increase by 20%.
o  Another scenario was based on a possibility that the power required for data processing
will be reduced; NTT is developing communication tech that seeks to reduce power
consumption to 1/100th.
o  Japan’s growth in total electricity demand is only about 1%, in large part due to

improving energy conservation.
•  The gap between predicting growth in data center power consumption and cases with no growth
was about 168 GWh.
•  CONTEXT: Geopolitical changes and conflicts make it difficult to use overseas data centers. This
has prompted overseas firms to invest in and build their own data centers in Japan. For instance,
Microsoft plans to invest $2.9 billion to build data centers in Japan. Softbank and investment firm
Asia Pacific Land also plan to expand into Japan with data centers.

• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s current net zero strategy by 2050 was drafted on the assumption that electricity demand
won’t increase dramatically. Now, the discussion will shift to whether the stable supply of electricity can be met
only by expanding the use of renewables and restarting nuclear power plants.




ANRE looks to abolish “partial supply” system amid expansion of wholesale market
(Government statement, April 9)
•  ANRE plans to make major changes to the ”partial supply'' system that was instituted in 2013 for

new power sources that lack access to their own generation facilities. The agency is considering
going as far as to abolish the system altogether.
•  CONTEXT: Under this system, major power utilities (EPCOs) sell part of their volume on the
wholesale market so that new market players (known as shin denryoku or PPSs) are able to
complement their own resources to meet contract commitments to clients.
•  Since the system’s introduction, however, demand from new market players has declined and there
are cases where retailers utilize the mechanism in a way that’s different from its original purpose,

10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

according to ANRE findings. For example, there have been cases when retailers asked an EPCO to
provide more electricity when prices are low and sell their own when prices are high, ANRE said.
•  Based on market surveys, ANRE believes it may make sense to abolish the “partial supply” system
in principle. The agency will also consider whether any transitional measures would be necessary in
such a scenario.
•  The officials noted that the environment for procuring electricity supply has improved with the

expansion of the wholesale power market, which is another reason to discontinue “partial supply”.



ENEOS Power installs one of Japan’s largest BESS

(Company statement, April 8)
•  In Muroran, Hokkaido, ENEOS Power installed the group’s
first grid storage battery, (output 50 MW and storage
capacity 88 MWh); it's one of Japan’s largest.
•  The firm plans to use the BESS in multiple markets, utilizing
its optimal operation control algorithm that can participate
in wholesale electricity markets, supply and demand

adjustment markets, and capacity markets.
•  In the future, ENEOS plans to develop a business that
utilizes the resources of storage batteries, power
generation facilities and demand facilities owned by
customers.

•  In the wake of the Baltimore bridge collapse, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said that
April exports from the U.S. will decrease 33% compared to previous estimates. May exports will
decrease 20% due to shipment restrictions.
•  The EIA expects U.S. coal exports to recover in late summer or early autumn.
•  CONTEXT: Baltimore Port accounted for 28% of U.S. coal exports in 2023. As far as destinations,
Japan was in the top spot; followed by China and Brazil.

• TAKEAWAY: Ever since Japan decided to phase out coal imports from Russia, imports from other countries
(notably Australia) have grown. In recent months, coal imports from the U.S. were about 7-9% of the total, thus
it’s unlikely that a decrease in U.S. coal exports will have a major impact on Japan.




Hitachi Zosen, M.O.L., etc claim 93.8% methane slip reduction for LNG-fueled ships
(Company statement, April 11)
•  Hitachi Zosen, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (M.O.L.),
and Yanmar Power Technology already

achieved a 93.8% reduction in methane slip
from LNG-fueled ship engines.
•  NEDO funded this effort to reduce methane
slip by 70% or more by FY2026.
•  Field studies will begin in autumn on a MOL-
operated vessel.

LNG stocks rose just over 8% in a week
(Government data, April 10)
•  LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 1.6 mln tons as of April 7, up 8.1% from 1.48 mln tons a
week earlier. But this is down 31.3% from end March (2.33 mln tons) in 2023, and down 20.8%

from the past 5-year average of 2.02 mln tons.
•  CONTEXT: Japan is expecting warm weather in the coming weeks, and demand from heating
devices is expected to decline.

Energy Transition Focus: Norway and Japan Bet Big on Offshore Wind

Last week, a delegation of Norway’s major offshore wind companies visited Tokyo to
meet with METI officials, the Japan Wind Power Association and leading energy
companies such as TEPCO Renewable Power, Tokyo Gas, Kansai Electric, etc, in order
to showcase Norwegian technology and solutions.

This high profile meeting came just several months after Norway’s Prime Minister
Jonas Gahr Støre visited Tokyo to meet Prime Minister Kishida Fumio and discuss
ways to expand cooperation in renewables and clean energy technologies.

Japan and Norway share a number of approaches in energy. Both have committed to
net zero policies, but also firmly believe in the right to continue exploring
hydrocarbon resources for the sake of energy security. The two countries are also in
lockstep when it comes to subsea mining, a practice that targets raw materials below
the seafloor that are critical for clean tech such as EV batteries and more.

During his Tokyo visit, PM Støre conveyed to PM Kishida Norway’s interest in
cooperation in decarbonizing the countries’ maritime sectors, developing hydrogen
fuel for hard-to-abate industries, as well as ramping up battery production, and
carbon capture and storage projects.


But perhaps the most prominent and immediate touchpoint between the two
countries will be in wind power. Among a flurry of recent Japan-Norway energy deals,
the most significant deal was JERA’s subsidiary, Parkwind, joining a European
consortium last month to develop a 1.5 GW wind farm off Norway’s southern coast.

Even the offshore wind capacity targets of Norway and Japan are similar: the former
seeks 30 GW by 2040; the latter -- 35 to 45 GW by the same deadline.

Leaving oil and gas behind
Norway and Japan are mountainous countries with some of the longest coastlines in
the northern hemisphere. Both have long been maritime powers that are highly
dependent on trade and shipping.

Situated at opposite ends of the Eurasian landmass, Norway and Japan are also
bound geopolitically through alliances with the U.S., especially in wake of current
efforts to contain and weaken Russia through a myriad of sanctions especially
targeting Moscow’s energy sector. While Norway is energy self-sufficient, Japan is
highly dependent on energy imports, including natural gas from Russia.

Norway’s economic miracle of the past 60 years has come in large part thanks to
crude oil and natural gas production, which accounts for nearly half of the country's
export revenue and about 24% of its GDP. But the need to find alternatives to oil and
gas and transition to sustainable energy is leading the country to seek like-minded
allies to navigate the shift in a pragmatic way. During that December 2023 meeting in

Tokyo, PM Støre described offshore wind power as "an obvious opportunity" for
collaboration.

Norway is investing heavily to develop offshore wind and other clean energy tech. The
country will allocate licenses for a potential 30 GW of offshore wind by 2040, which is
about 75% of the capacity of the current Norwegian power system. Japan is slated to
become a major partner in these efforts.

Norway, however, has competition; it’s not the only suitable partner for Japan. In
October 2023, the Danish PM visited Tokyo to meet PM Kishida. The two countries
said they’ll also cooperate on floating offshore wind power generation, and want to
come up with global standards for the sector. Home to giants like wind turbine maker
Vestas, and Orsted, the world's leading wind turbine operator, Denmark is an offshore
wind powerhouse that also seeks to develop cooperation with Japan.

Norway’s offshore wind power
Last week, April 8-11, Norwegian Offshore Wind (NOW), a trade group with almost
400 members, visited Japan. Gunnar Birkeland, the NOW chair and CEO of Source
Galileo Norway, sees “huge potential for Japan-Norway cooperation specifically in
future floating wind projects.”

Kishida’s government agrees and it’s eyeing the vast waters of the country’s Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) to tap into the potential of floating wind power. In January,
METI and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism wrote a draft
framework for managing stakeholder interests in EEZ offshore wind projects. While
floating offshore wind platforms will be located further from shore than stationary
offshore wind farms, allowing them to harness more powerful winds, the technology is
still experimental and in its nascent stage.


Norway hopes that floating offshore wind will help cut emissions at sites of oil and gas
production by replacing gas turbines as a source of power supply. For example, in
2023, Hywind Tampen, the world's largest floating wind farm, was launched by
Equinor, INPEX Idemitsu and Wintershall Dea. Anchored to the sea floor at depths of
almost 300 meters, the project’s 11 floating turbines have a total of 88 MW capacity
that should meet about 35% of the power needs of Equinor's oil and gas fields in the
North Sea.

Another significant development came in early March, when state funding to the tune
of 2 billion Norwegian crowns ($193 million) was granted to GoliatVind in the Barents
Sea. The project consists of five 15 MW turbines that will supply power to the Arctic
town of Hammerfest. GoliatVind is owned by Irish renewables developer Source
Galileo and Odfjell Oceanwind, a Norwegian firm developing floating foundations for
offshore wind turbines.

Late last year, Kansai Electric (KEPCO) joined GoliatVind when it signed an agreement
to invest in Odfjell Oceanwind. KEPCO is not the only Japanese shareholder; earlier in
2023, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines also acquired a stake in Odfjell Oceanwind.

Currently, however, the most lucrative opportunity is in fixed-bottom offshore wind
farms. Japanese firms are finding opportunities for collaboration on such projects in

Norway. In March, offshore wind developer Ventyr, which is an alliance of Parkwind,
IKEA-linked Ingka Investments, and NorSea Group, won a bid to develop the 1.5 GW
Southern North Sea II project. The first turbines are expected to be operational by
2030.

Parkwind is Belgium’s largest offshore wind platform, operating four offshore wind
projects in that country, totaling 771 MW. JERA acquired Parkwind in July 2023 from
Virya Energy.

Japan’s offshore wind sector
Similar size opportunities exist in Japan’s sector, where the government seeks to
distribute licenses for 10 GW of wind capacity by 2030 and up to 40 GW by 2040.

With an eye to expand in Japanese waters, Norway’s legacy oil and gas company
Equinor is teaming up with JERA and power utility J-Power, which is Japan’s second
largest wind power producer. J-Power has operated onshore wind power projects in
Akita for several years and was awarded the Kitakyushu Hibikinada 220 MW offshore
wind project in 2017.

Equinor opened its Tokyo office in 2018 betting on Japan as a growth market with
high potential for both bottom fixed and floating offshore wind. With nearly 20 years
of offshore wind experience, Equinor already has a strong offshore wind portfolio with
assets in key markets including the UK, Poland, Germany and South Korea.


Breaking into Japan’s burgeoning offshore wind industry, however, is as yet proving
difficult. Round 1 results didn’t see a single international firm among the winners.
Equinor had teamed up with JERA and J-Power to bid on two offshore wind farms
(819 MW Yurihonjo City, and 479 MW Noshiro City) in Akita Prefecture. However,
they lost to a consortium led by Mitsubishi Corp, which vacuumed up all the fixed-
bottom licenses in the Round 1 tenders.

In Round 2, Germany’s RWE was part of a winning consortium for one of the wind
farms – the 684 MW wind farm auction off the coast of Murakami-Tainai in Niigata
Pref. Spain’s Iberdrola was part of the group that won the tender for a 375 MW
project off the coast of Happo-Noshiro in Akita prefecture.

With so much in common in terms of geography and energy transition needs, Norway
and Japan are slated to become key partners in each’s plans to decarbonize their
economies, especially since companies from both countries are also deeply involved
in ammonia / hydrogen projects, and have common interests in the contentious niche
of subsea mining.

This is where reciprocity is likely to play a role in the bilateral relation. JERA’s success
in Norway’s offshore wind sector makes one wonder if Tokyo may feel obliged to
respond in kind. The Round 3 offshore wind tender in Japan is already open, with
results expected towards the end of this year.

A failure to award at least one contract to a group involving a Norwegian player might
be construed as a snub, and could stall other bilateral projects in clean energy.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE
How Idemitsu’s Ammonia-fueled Naphtha Cracker Impacts Net Zero

In the past two years, Japan’s interest and demand for ammonia as a clean-burning
fuel has been squarely focused on the power generation sector. But another
significant user of ammonia in Japan may have recently emerged.

In February, oil refining major Idemitsu Kosan announced the country’s first success at
running a commercial naphtha cracker facility with a fuel mix that was 20% based on
ammonia. The development was largely unexpected. Such a use case is years ahead
of the government’s net-zero roadmap for the sector that’s vital for the chemicals
industry.

Now that one industrial facility that requires very high temperatures has been shown
to work on an alternative to fossil fuel-derived gases, what’s stopping other industrial
furnaces from making the switch? High heat is usually produced by burning methane,
and other hydrocarbons. But Idemitsu’s trial shows that ‘hard-to-abate’ industries may
not be as far away from decarbonization solutions as their moniker suggests.

More importantly, the result positions Japan among the leaders in cleaning up the
chemicals and plastics sector, which accounts for a significant part of the economy
and is one of the nation’s top employers. Although domestic consumption of
petrochemicals has declined, Japan’s refining companies have long since expanded
into regional markets and have plants all over Southeast Asia. Thus, the reach of the
solution – and the impact on ammonia demand – could be significant.


Life in plastic, not so fantastic
In the 1990’s, Japan’s production of ethylene – a basic feedstock of plastics made
from naphtha, which is originally made from crude oil – hit a record high of above 7
million tons per year, thanks to robust exports to Asia.

Presently, annual ethylene output is under 6 million tons. Competition with China and
Southeast Asia, as well as climate change and possible carbon import duties overseas,
are forcing the sector to rethink its strategy and find new ways to survive.

Japan is keen to protect its domestic chemicals sector much like it does the
automotive companies. The chemicals and plastic products industries employ close to
800,000 people, or about a tenth of all manufacturing jobs in the country. However,
it’s clear that a shift away from fossil fuels will require a strategy based on a transition
to new clean materials, and high value-added products with little or no carbon
footprint.

One highly aspirational example of this strategy is a sports car built with components
made from plant-derived cellulose fibers. The Nano Cellulose Vehicle (NCV) project
backed by MoE funds produced a concept car in 2019 that boasted a number of
parts, including the hood, that could be recycled. Among the firms involved were
those that make plastics from crude oil (via naphtha and ethylene, etc.).

Until the costs to make such materials are reduced, the petrochemicals sector will
have to find other ways to manage its CO2 footprint. In FY2022, petrochemical
emissions (excluding cement) were 55 million CO2-equivalent tons, or about 22% of
Japan’s non-power industrial emissions. The sector was the worst emitter after power
generation and steel.

One approach to combat emissions is to subsidize the installation of CCS technology
at petrochem plants. But the government is asking industry to come up with structural
solutions: shift its energy sources to clean-burning ammonia/hydrogen from fossil
fuels; develop new chemical feeds to replace ethylene; establish a chemical recycling
ecosystem; and focus on niche products where Japan can retain high market shares.


Out of the 55 million tons CO2e that the chemical sector emits, 10 million tons are
from producing ethylene (the foundation block for most household and industrial
chemicals). Ethylene is made by breaking up naphtha molecules through a process
called “cracking”. The latter requires a furnace that’s heated to 850ºC. The fuel most
commonly used to achieve this temperature today is methane, which when released
into the atmosphere is multiple times more damaging than CO2.

Japan’s naphtha market
There are 12 naphtha crackers owned by six business groups in the country, with a
total ethylene output capacity of around 61 million tons / year.

Idemitsu’s ammonia test
Idemitsu Kosan has been a strong ammonia proponent, even as its domestic peers
focused on other hydrogen carriers: ENEOS – methylcyclohexane (MCH); Cosmo Oil –
liquefied hydrogen.

Idemitsu wants to turn its Tokuyama refinery (Yamaguchi Pref) into an ammonia supply
base, importing 1 million tons a year from the U.S. Oil product storage tanks would be
converted into ammonia tanks and pipelines installed to deliver ammonia to
consumers.

Other ammonia advocates are Mitsui Chemicals and Maruzen Petrochemical that are
studying ammonia as a full methane replacement in naphtha crackers. The
government is funding ¥16.6 billion or 70% of the 100% ammonia-fueled naphtha
cracking project cost through the Green Innovation Fund (GIF).

Idemitsu is not receiving GIF funds for its R&D into ammonia fuel in naphtha crackers,
but it is logical for the company to explore this technology as it already has access to
ammonia supply.

Over Feb 6-8, Idemitsu tested the operation of a naphtha cracker at its Tokuyama
refinery fueled by 20% ammonia and the rest from “off gases”. The country’s second
largest naphtha cracker had just undergone a major revamp, carried out by IHI Plant
Engineering, which boosted its performance and energy efficiency. The work also
included installing an ammonia burner to diversify the fuel mix.

According to Idemitsu, the final fuel mix had ammonia at above 20% but below 30%
of the total. Unlike Mitsui Chemicals, Idemitsu is not looking to run its cracker on
100% ammonia fuel, because development costs would be higher, a company
spokeswoman told Japan NRG. She added that 700 kg / hour of ammonia was used,
but declined to give the actual consumption figure, or the cracker run rate during the
test.

Idemitsu said the test was successful as the cracker operated normally despite the
updated fuel mix. The NOx release from burning ammonia was also within
environmental norms. Full details of the test, such as the composition of the off-gases,
the amount of ethylene produced, etc, were not available. But the results imply that
ammonia is good enough to start replacing some methane at naphtha crackers.

Rivals Mitsui Chemicals, Maruzen Petrochemical, Toyo Engineering and Sojitz
Machinery are hoping to go one (or several) step better. They are focused on tech
that would allow for the use of ammonia as the sole fuel, but this will require more
time. At present, the group plans to create a test ammonia burner for a naphtha
cracker that would produce 10,000 tons of ethylene a year by around 2025. This
wouldn’t be upgraded to a commercial size furnace until 2030, which would mean that
commercial operations of a full-size ammonia cracker may not be available until 2040.

Possible impact on ammonia demand
According to METI, 6.7 million tons / year of ammonia are required if three 1-million-
ton-per-year naphtha crackers run at full capacity and use ammonia. That translates
into 2.23 million tons of ammonia for each million tons of ethylene.

Japan NRG calculated the potential ammonia demand from existing naphtha crackers
based on this figure, as shown in the table below. If by 2030 ammonia replaces
cracker fuel entirely, the industry will require over 13 million tons / year of ammonia. If
there is a 20% shift across plants, that demand level would still be at 2.75 million
tons / year.

If only Idemitsu’s Tokuyama shifts to 20% ammonia, demand would be around
280,000 tons / year.

All naphtha crackers shift to full ammonia fuel 13
All crackers use 20% ammonia          2.75
Mitsui Chemical’s Osaka cracker shifts to full 1.29
ammonia fuel, Idemitsu’s Tokuyama cracker to 20%
ammonia
Only Idemitsu’s Tokuyama shifts to 20% ammonia 0.28

Conclusion
Japan NRG sent a questionnaire to companies running naphtha crackers to ask if they
plan to shift to ammonia fuel. So far, ENEOS has replied they have no such plans.
Idemitsu says there’s a “possibility” that 20% ammonia use could be introduced at its
other cracker, in Chiba. Other firms were less forthcoming with answers.

According to METI’s scenario, ammonia demand in 2030 will triple to 3 million tons /
year from the present 1 million ton / year, thanks to demand from power generation,
shipping, industrial furnaces and fuel cell segments. The ministry, however, has not
elaborated on exactly how much will come from each segment.

Idemitsu’s success has provided clarity to METI’s vague forecast. The power sector is
seen generating the largest demand, of up to 1.3 million tons / year by 2030,
provided there are two 1-GW-sized units co-firing at 20% and three smaller (100 MW)
plants.

Naphtha cracking and other industrial furnaces could well be the second-largest
demand center, with at least 200,000 tons / year. While concrete use cases in shipping
and elsewhere are yet to appear, the chemical industry is starting to show more than
potential – it is offering solid data and momentum.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

ASEAN / Energy demand
Energy demand in the ASEAN countries could increase 21% this year over 2021, with
fossil fuels to dominate. The ASEAN Centre for Energy said oil will hold the largest
share in energy consumption at 45.8%.

Bangladesh / Natural gas
Total electricity generation from natural gas is expected to grow to 93 TWh by 2032,
up from 70 TWh in 2023. It will be driven by state plans to build more gas-fired power
plants. The power sector is Bangladesh's largest natural gas consumer, comprising
39% of total consumption last year.

China / Coal
The state planner finalized a rule to set up a domestic coal reserve system by 2027 in
order to stabilize thermal coal prices and supplies to power plants. The rule calls for
300 MMT of dispatchable annual coal production by 2030, equal to about 6% of last
year's output.

Coal
In 2023, total global coal power plant capacity saw a net increase of 48.4 GW, the
highest growth since 2016, bringing the total to 2.13 TW, said Global Energy Monitor.
About 69.5 GW of coal power came online last year, two-thirds of which, or around 47
GW, were from China; meanwhile, 21 GW was retired during that period.

India / Hydropower
India has 15 GW of hydroelectric power projects under construction; if realized, it
would increase the country's total hydro capacity by over 50% to 67 GW by 2032, up
from the current total of 42 GW.

India / Pumped storage
Pumped storage capacity might reach 55 GW by 2032, up from today’s 4.7 GW. India
has 2.5 GW of pumped storage capacity under construction; an additional 48 GW of
such projects are in the planning stage.

Indonesia / LNG-fueled station
PT Jawa Satu Power started operations of an LNG-fueled power plant (1.76 GW) that’s
100 km east of Jakarta. This is significant because Indonesia relies on coal-fired power
generation to meet 60% of its energy needs.

Myanmar / Natural gas
Chevron has quit the Yadana natural gas field. Rather than being sold, Chevron's
41.1% stake was redistributed to the other shareholders — Thailand's PTT Exploration
and Production and state-owned Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise. PTTEP, the gas
field’s operator, said its Yadana stake had increased to 62.96%.

Natural gas demand
By 2050, the global power sector will account for 40% to 50% of natural gas demand,
with Asia to account for the largest growth, said McKinsey, adding that power sector
demand growth is driven by increasing electrification requirements in building and
industry.

Philippines / Power
Power company First Gen said it targets to reach 13 GW of total power capacity by
2030 but it will need investment of $20 billion; this includes work on the 1.2 GW Santa
Maria natural gas power station in Batangas province.
