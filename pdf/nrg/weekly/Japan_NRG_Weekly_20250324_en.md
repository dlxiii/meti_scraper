NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


METI announces changes to renewables rates for FY2025 and beyond

(Government statement, March 21)
•  METI announced changes to the purchase prices for renewables from April 2025.
•  To accelerate the adoption of rooftop solar power, METI will introduce the Initial Investment
Support Scheme in the second half of FY2025, ensuring no additional burden on the public. The
purchase prices will be set as follows:
o  Residential PV: ¥24/ kWh (for up to 4 years); ¥8.3/ kWh ( 5–10 years)
o  Commercial rooftop PV: ¥19/ kWh (up to 5 years); ¥8.3/ kWh (6–20 years)
•  The purchase price for FY2025 will be separately determined through auctions. The auction will
apply to FIP-certified projects of 250 kW or more, except for rooftop installations, which are
exempt. There will be four auction rounds, with the following maximum bid prices: ¥8.90/ kWh;
¥8.83/ kWh; ¥8.75/ kWh; ¥8.68/ kWh.
•  For onshore wind, the FY2025 purchase price will be settled via auction. There will be one round,
with a maximum bid price of ¥13/ kWh. If the total auctioned capacity exceeds 1.2 GW, another
auction will be held in the same fiscal year.
•  For fixed-bottom offshore wind power (excluding areas covered by the Renewables Utilization Act),
the purchase price for FY2025 will be determined through public tenders auctions, with the
maximum bid price undisclosed in advance.
•  For floating offshore wind (excluding areas covered by the Renewable Sea Area Utilization Act), the
purchase price will remain at ¥36/ kWh until FY2027.
•  The changed rates are as follows:

o  A standard household consuming 400 kWh/ month will see an additional ¥196/ month
compared to the previous year.
o  The increase is mainly due to higher renewable energy purchases and a decline in market
electricity prices.
o  For FY2025, the total monthly surcharge for a standard household will be ¥1,592, or
¥19,104 annually. In fiscal 2024, the surcharge was ¥3.49/ kWh.
o  CONTEXT: Japan introduced the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) system in 2012 to promote renewables,
requiring utilities to purchase solar and wind power at fixed rates for 10 to 20 years. This cost
is covered by adding surcharges to electricity bills. The surcharge is determined annually by the
METI minister. It is calculated by subtracting the revenue from selling renewables on the
wholesale electricity market from the total cost of purchasing renewables from producers.



ANRE promotes grid development to accommodate localized data centers
(Government statement, March 17)
•  ANRE will review grid investment rules to address inefficient power infrastructure development
caused by rapidly increasing, localized data center demand.
•  It will reconsider the current "first-come, first-served" approach that leads to excess infrastructure
when early applicants withdraw their plans after new capacity has been built. The agency is also
looking at factors such as who should cover the costs involved and how to optimize the efficiency of
new grid facilities.
•  Officials will consider fairer cost allocation methods, such as potentially charging large consumers
for additional costs incurred due to changes or delays.
•  Govt action will follow a review of the Inzai and Shirai areas of Chiba Pref, where many data

centers are being developed, and of structural changes in local grids.
•  Companies will be asked to cooperate to gather reliable information, and officials may even look at
certain contract conditions.
•  CONTEXT: As new data centers and related facilities are concentrated in certain areas, the govt aims to
take a more active role as arbiter of disputes and also to ensure that development is aligned with that of
local grids and their future upgrade.
•  ANRE also aims to provide better grid-capacity information to municipalities, which should help
them to attract data centers to areas with excess grid capacity and avoid costly infrastructure
upgrades in other regions with bottlenecks.



Japan to invest €100 mln in French rare-earth refining project
(Company statement, March 17)
•  Japan will invest up to €110 million in a French rare-earth refining project run by Caremag, a
subsidiary of Carester. The JV, Japan France Rare Earth, seeks to reduce reliance on China.
•  JOGMEC and trading house Iwatani invested in the JV, which will itself invest in equity and
shareholder loans in the Caremag plant.
•  This deal includes long-term supplies of heavy rare earth oxides for Japan. France will provide over
€100 million in subsidies and tax breaks.
•  The deal gives Japan 50% of the heavy rare earth oxides produced by the firm, providing Japan
with 20% of its future dysprosium and terbium demand, needed to make magnets for EV motors,
offshore wind turbine generators, and electronics.
•  Caremag is building a rare earth refining plant in Lacq, France, set to start in late 2026. The facility
plans output of 600 tons of dysprosium and terbium oxides, about 15% of global production.

•  CONTEXT: Iwatani has been importing rare earths to Japan since the 1990s. Through the equity and
debt financing to Caremag, the company will strengthen Japan’s global supply chain of rare earths.














MUFG to leave climate banking alliance amid growing exodus

(Nikkei Asia, March 19)
•  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group plans to withdraw from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, following
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Nomura Holdings.
•  Nevertheless, MUFG will maintain its sustainable finance goals. It will continue supporting
decarbonization investments for domestic companies.
•  This decision is due to increasing backlash and legal risks in the U.S., as well as declining global
momentum for coordinated climate efforts.
•  The three remaining Japanese banks – Mizuho Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, and
Norinchukin Bank – are reconsidering membership. Similar exits have occurred among U.S. banks
like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.
•  Critics say the alliance violates antitrust laws and operates as a "climate cartel."
•  CONTEXT: The NZBA, which once had 145 members, now faces a steady decline, with membership a
little over 130. Macquarie Group also exited.



MILT, METI report on activities of Aviation Decarbonization Council in FY2024
(Government statement, March 18)
•  MILT and METI reported on the activities of the “New Technology Public-Private Council for
Decarbonizing Aircraft” in FY2024.
•  In the light of technological development trends such as aircraft electrification, hydrogen-powered
aircraft, and weight reduction, the agencies are trying to build a domestic cooperation system for
international standardization, including surveys of standardization trends, examination of
standardization activity strategies and policies, participation in standardization bodies and
establishment of cooperation relations, etc.
•  CONTEXT: To promote decarbonization in the aviation sector, MILT and METI established the "New
Technology Public-Private Council for Decarbonizing Aviation" in June 2022 and have been discussing
the issue in three technical working groups (electrification, hydrogen, and lightweighting/efficiency). A
new technology roadmap will be drawn up, outlining the establishment of a national partnership
system.
• TAKEAWAY: This council focuses only on electrification, hydrogen use, weight reduction and efficiency, which
will require new technologies. It does not cover SAF, which is a drop-in substitute for existing fuels. Hydrogen-

fueled and lightweight aircrafts are being developed by KHI, MHI, and other companies as part of the Green
Innovation Fund. JAXA and IHI are developing electric-powered aircraft.



MoE selects five projects for subsidy program within JCM
(Government statement, March 13)
•  The MoE selected four projects for the fourth round, and one project for the fifth round, of the
FY2024 Equipment Subsidy Program under the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM).
•  The selected projects focus on renewable energy and efficiency, and span countries such as
Indonesia, Cambodia, and the Philippines.
•  In Indonesia and Cambodia, the projects are led by KEPCO and Chugoku Electric.
•  CONTEXT: The JCM, established in 2013, promotes adoption of advanced decarbonization technologies
in partner countries, as well as measuring and verifying GHG reductions. JCM credits help Japan to
achieve emission reduction targets, which are shared between both countries under Article 6 of the Paris
Agreement. Japan partners with 29 countries, implementing over 250 projects. The goal is to reduce or
absorb about 100 Mt of GHGs by 2030.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Chugoku Electric to invest in solar and battery storage in Cambodia
(Company statement, March 13)
o  Chugoku Electric will invest in a solar farm with battery storage in Pursat Province,
Cambodia, partnering with SchneiTec, a local renewables firm. They will build and operate
the solar farm (13.75 MW). Chugoku Electric has a 10% stake in the project.
o  The electricity will be sold to Electricité du Cambodge under a 20-year PPA; operations are
set to begin in April.
o  This initiative was selected under MoE’s Japan’s Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM).
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TOKAI’s hydropower project in Philippines wins JCM grant
(Company statement, March 13)
o  Energy firm TOKAI’s hydropower project in the Philippines was selected under the MoE’s
2024 JCM equipment subsidy program.
o  The project is a new 4.5 MW hydro station on the Piapi River, Luzon. It’s scheduled to
begin operations in early 2027.

TEPCO announces new business plan, seeks ways to break negative cash flow
(Company statement, March 17)
•  TEPCO announced an interim reconstruction plan, approved by the govt.
•  Officially known as the "Comprehensive Special Business Plan", it revises the current one from
2021, and includes profit and loss forecasts through FY2025.
•  TEPCO seeks an extra ¥1.9 trillion in assistance from the govt. METI approved revisions, which
forecasts a net profit of ¥57.2 billion for the current FY. It foresees ¥113.7 billion for the following
FY.
•  Despite this, TEPCO expects cash flow to remain negative, with an estimated ¥960 billion shortfall
over the next two years, due to Fukushima-related expenses. The new plan assumes that one
nuclear reactor will restart within the year.

6



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The Comprehensive Special Business Plan outlines compensation strategies for the
Fukushima Daiichi accident, focusing on business growth and financial recovery under state oversight.
Since the first plan in 2012, TEPCO has implemented cost-cutting and business restructuring. The
current (2021) plan targets ¥450 billion in net profit after 2030, and a decarbonization-driven
transition. The next plan will focus on financial restructuring and external capital infusion to address
ongoing liquidity challenges after six consecutive years of negative cash flow.
•  CONTEXT: TEPCO will release the next full plan after summer 2025. For the first time, TEPCO
presented consolidated earnings forecasts for five group companies. Notably, its project expanded profit
next year is heavily dependent on the operation of at least one nuclear reactor during FY2025. Its cash,
and cash equivalents, which recently stood at about ¥900 billion, will likely decline to ¥382 billion by
the end of FY2024 (i.e. March 2025). The utility requires around ¥300 billion in cash reserves to
maintain stable operations.
• TAKEAWAY: Decommissioning costs for Fukushima Daiichi NPP continue to rise. Delays in restarting
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP only worsen cash flow. TEPCO’s financial situation has stalled and without main
shareholder cash injections – in other words, additional cash from the government – the company is bankrupt.
Should it fail to meet goals for the reconstruction plan and NPP restart, the overall national energy strategy
(especially for the Kanto region) will also be impacted. How long such a dire state of affairs will be allowed to
continue is anyone’s guess, but the tactic of presenting financials on the basis of restarts has not helped the
restarts occur in the past.



Fuji Keizai sees rise in renewables-derived power curtailments

(Company statement, March 13)
•  A study by research firm Fuji Keizai on solar and wind output curtailment predicts an increase from
21.6 TWh of curtailed volumes in 2024 to 131.1 TWh by 2040.
•  Nationwide curtailment is expected by 2030 as renewables reach 30% of the energy mix. To
address this, battery storage, demand response (DR), and incentive-driven energy consumption
measures are needed.
•  The study analyzed demand for green electricity, which in 2024 was estimated at 588 TWh (5.5%
of the total), mainly in Tokyo, Chubu, and Kansai. By 2040, it’s projected to grow fivefold to 2,878
TWh, or about 25% of total electricity demand.
•  Corporate decarbonization efforts, green power incentives, and rooftop solar adoption in new
buildings are expected to further drive growth.



JERA to begin seasonal coal plant shutdowns
(Nikkei Asia, March 21)
•  By FY2026, JERA will start shutting some coal-fired plants on a seasonal basis. It will focus on high-
emission sites like the Hekinan power station. The goal is to reduce CO2 emissions and shift coal
from a baseload power source to usage based on occasional demand. During peak demand or low
renewables output periods, JERA will burn more LNG.
•  Another utility, J-Power, has already started such seasonal cutbacks in 2023 on a trial basis. The
company reduces coal use during sunny hours but increases it at night. J-Power expects the
approach to also boost FY2024 profits by tens of billions of yen.
•  Coal has a low generation cost (¥10.7/ kWh). Still, falling electricity prices (driven by nuclear
restarts) are making coal less competitive. Rising coal costs is also a big issue. Australian mine
closures, for example, could worsen the situation.


7



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Coal remains 30% of Japan’s power mix, but its future is uncertain as cost pressures and
global trends push toward cleaner energy. The govt has introduced subsidies to maintain idle coal
plants as emergency backups but there is no utility interest in the scheme at present.
•  CONTEXT: For more information about the future of Japan’s coal-fired thermal power plants, please
see the Feb 3 issue of Japan NRG.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s coal power plants are under increasing regulatory pressure. There are upcoming carbon
reporting mandates and capacity factor limits on inefficient plants. These policies are forcing utilities to adjust
their operational strategies. This is making long-term reliance on coal less viable. Also, METI’s capacity auctions
aim to encourage new LNG capacity, but supply gaps remain as existing plants retire. Meanwhile, reserve
auctions to keep thermal plants as backups struggle to attract bidders due to low prices.



Electricity demand rises for fifth consecutive month; new suppliers’ share at 19%
(Japan NRG, Govt statement, March 21)
•  Japan's electricity demand in November 2024 reached 63.15 TWh, up 1.6% YoY from 62.41 TWh,
marking the fifth consecutive month of YoY growth.
•  New power providers (shin denryoku) saw sales rise 20.7%, reaching 11.33 TWh, a 18.8% market
share. In the low-voltage segment for households the share was 24.2%.

•  Meanwhile, major power utilities saw sales fall 2.6% to 48.77 TWh, for a seven straight month of
decline.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Number of retailers grow; Marubeni up to third in rankings
(Government statement, March 17)
o  The number of registered new power players was 704 companies as of November 2024, up
by two from the previous month, according to ANRE. The number of active retailers, as in
those registering sales, was at 499, one down from a year earlier.
o  Meanwhile, in the latest ranking of power retailers – available for October – Tokyo Gas
maintained its position as the biggest seller of electricity in Japan outside of the major
power utilities, while Marubeni climbed to third, overtaking Osaka Gas. The No. 2 retailer
overall and the biggest supplier of extra-high-voltage power was Ennet, which is a JV
between NTT Anode Energy, Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas.



METI orders TEPCO PG to address issues related to misinformation on grid
(Government statement, March 21)
•  ANRE told TEPCO Power Grid (TEPCO PG) to implement strict measures to prevent a recurrence of
incorrect responses during pre-consultations for grid connections.
•  Following an investigation, ANRE received a report from TEPCO PG on Feb 28, detailing the
circumstances leading to the incident, its impact on businesses, and proposed corrective actions.
•  Based on this report, ANRE issued guidance today to ensure compliance with regulations and
prevent similar incidents in the future.
•  CONTEXT: The issue concerns TEPCO PG’s incorrect responses to pre-consultations from entities
seeking to connect their power generation facilities to the network. Under the guidelines for T&D
operations, TEPCO PG was required to provide accurate information for the connection process.
However, it gave incorrect answers, potentially affecting business decisions and project feasibility for
those seeking grid connections. Under Article 106, of the Electricity Business Act, METI has the
authority to request reports and materials from utility operators regarding their operations and review
compliance with regulations.

Iwatani exits Queensland green hydrogen project amid industry challenges
(Nikkei Asia, March 19)
•  Iwatani will withdraw from a major green hydrogen project in Queensland, Australia. This follows
the exit of other Japanese companies and the Queensland govt’s decision to halt further
investments.
•  CONTEXT: The project planned annual production of 70,000 tons of green hydrogen by 2028. But, it
faced increasing financial and logistical difficulties.
•  Green hydrogen has high production and transportation costs, requiring subsidies. Iwatani had
invested across the supply chain but is now scaling back operations.
•  This withdrawal reflects a broader industry trend. Companies like Kawasaki Heavy Industries also
face setbacks in hydrogen-related ventures.
• TAKEAWAY: This is not a major surprise given that most of Iwatani’s partners in the project, including Kansai
Electric, have already pulled out. There is still strong Japanese interest in Australian hydrogen supply, especially
since the passing of local legislation to subsidize production. Which Australian projects make economic sense
under the new conditions is under review by the Japanese sector players.



MHI advances SOEC tech to boost green hydrogen production

(Company statement, March 21)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is advancing Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) technology at its
Takasago Hydrogen Park.
•  The company’s SOEC unit now operates at 800–1000° C and has achieved an efficiency rate of 85–
90%, outperforming conventional alkaline and PEM electrolysis systems.
•  CONTEXT: Unlike PEM systems, SOEC does not rely on scarce precious metals like platinum or iridium,
instead using yttria-stabilized zirconia, which offers durability and reduces dependence on rare
materials.
•  MHI plans to commercialize large-scale SOEC systems (hundreds of megawatts) by the late 2020s,
leveraging its expertise in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) technology. The target is a total system
efficiency of 90%.

JAES develops world's first uranium-based battery

(Company statement, March 13)
•  The Japan Atomic Energy Agency developed the world's first battery using uranium. If
commercialized, it could provide a new use for "depleted uranium," a byproduct of nuclear fuel
production, and serve as a storage solution for surplus electricity from renewable energy sources
such as large-scale solar farms.
•  The 10 centimeter-wide, 5 cm-tall battery uses a uranium-containing electrolyte for the negative
electrode and an iron-containing electrolyte for the positive electrode. The battery operates at 1.3
volts, similar to a standard 1.5-volt dry cell battery, and in a test it successfully powered an LED
light. It was charged and discharged 10 times.
•  Starting in FY2025, JAEA plans to develop the battery into a redox flow one, which increases
storage capacity by circulating electrolyte through a tank using a pump.
•  Application would be limited to radiation-controlled areas, such as in a NPP site.
• TAKEAWAY: Pairing redox flow batteries with large thermal power plants has already been trialed in Japan and
there are several examples. This would extend a similar principle to NPPs for a depleted uranium battery. What
role such a battery would play in the energy grid, however, is as yet unclear.

PAJ calls for the govt to consider industry’s needs for emissions trading systems
(Nikkei, March 21)
•  Kito Shunichi, Chairman of the Petroleum Association of Japan, called for the govt to design the
emissions trading system, set to be implemented in FY2026, to reflect the realities of the oil
industry.
•  He said it’s difficult for the petroleum refining sector to reduce CO2 emissions immediately, and
urged the govt to avoid imposing excessive burdens.
•  CONTEXT: Under the new emissions trading system, the govt will allocate annual CO2 emission quotas
to top emitters over a certain threshold. If emissions exceed the quota, companies will have to buy
credits from others to offset the excess.
• TAKEAWAY: Major industrial firms were able to subvert and significantly delay the shutdown of coal-fired
power plants in Japan as many of them rely on in-house units to supplement supply from the grid. Therefore it’s
still possible for the refinery firms to exert pressure on METI either to delay or soften the carbon credit markets.
This is likely only the beginning of the lobbying campaign by the refiners. That said, if the government is unable
to persuade the top emitters to transition into the system, the domestic carbon credits structure will be
ineffective, and that has a knock on effect on several other low-carbon sectors.

ANALYSIS

BY TETSUJI TOMITA

Future Prospects for e-Fuels: Will They Go Mainstream?

Late in 2024, Japan achieved a significant milestone: completing an entire synthetic
fuels value chain, from renewable electricity to usable synthetic gasoline and diesel.
This achievement, trumpeted by Japan's largest refiner, ENEOS, sought to confirm the
national strategy to bet on synthetic liquids – rather than electrification – as the long-
term future of transport fuel.
Transport accounts for a sixth of Japan’s emissions, and over a fifth of the world’s.
Pathways to decarbonize auto, shipping and aviation transport vary, but they could be
roughly split into those that seek to swap petroleum molecules for cleaner-burning
liquids and those that want to replace the energy source entirely to electrons via
batteries, etc.

Among the main supporters of the latter electron route is China, which has built a
comprehensive and near-dominant supply chain in batteries, and is on its way to
controlling the electric vehicles (EV) niche. Japanese automakers, however, have been
reluctant to turn fully to electrons for both social and strategic reasons. As such, Japan’s
strategy for cleaner transport emphasizes drop-in alternatives to petroleum products,
such as biofuels and synthetic fuels, also known as e-fuels.
The most immediate action that Japan can take to cut transport emissions is from
blending fuels made from organic matter – re-used cooking oil, processed sugarcane,
and biological waste. But the vast quantity of fuels required to power ocean shipping
and aviation, never mind the near-80 million cars on Japanese roads, mean that after
an initial biofuels-focused phase, energy planners see technological and commercial
success of e-fuels as existential for the domestic transport and machinery industries.

Japan NRG reviews the country’s progress on e-fuels to date and next steps.

Background
E-fuels span a broad range of petroleum-alternatives that apply across multiple sectors.
In most cases, however, these fuels mimic their crude oil cousins since they rely on a
hydrocarbon compound for energy. As long as the carbon added to e-fuel is produced
without emissions, (for example, by extracting it from the atmosphere using devices
powered by renewables), this can be deemed a carbon-neutral process since it does not
increase atmospheric CO2.
There are two main types of synthetic fuels: liquid fuels such as e-fuels or SAF
(Sustainable Aviation Fuel), and gaseous fuels such as e-methane and green LPG. Here,
we will focus on liquid e-fuels. The government is strongly backing e-fuels through
funding, policy targets, and partnerships. Key policy and incentive measures include:
•  Green Innovation Fund (GIF): This ¥2 trillion fund established by METI and
managed by NEDO has designated e-fuels as one of its priority areas. In April
2022, it awarded ¥114.5 billion to a suite of e-fuel, SAF, e-methane, and e-LPG
projects. The major grants went to ENEOS (¥54.6 billion), Idemitsu SAF (¥29.2
billion), Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas for methane projects, and Furukawa Electric
(¥3.6 billion) for LPG. These are multi-year subsidies that cover a significant
share of R&D and demo costs.
•  Targets: Together with the gas utilities, METI decided to have 1% of Japan’s
city gas come from e-methane by 2030 (scaling to 90% by 2050); 10% of
17

aviation fuel come from SAF by 2030; raise biofuel blending ratio for road
transport fuel to 10% by 2030; and develop high-efficiency e-fuel production
technology this decade, with an eye on commercialization in the following
decade.
•  Demand-side incentives and regulations: subsidy schemes already in operation
include the Contract for Difference (CfD) auction for hydrogen-related
synthetic fuels, and a program targeting airlines to help with SAF purchases, is
also in the works. Further blending requirement mandates and certification
mechanisms for e-fuels are expected.
R&D goals
The main manufacturing processes for synthetic fuels are the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
(FT) and methanol synthesis. Both are existing technologies that utilize raw materials
such as syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) and CO2.

Today, Japan’s R&D is focused on the next generation of FT, such as direct-FT, CO2
electrolysis, and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) co-electrolysis, among others. The
goal is to lessen the vast volume of energy required for synthesis, while improving
efficiency through new catalysts and minimizing the release of byproducts such as
methane and other light gases.
ENEOS announced a breakthrough in creating homegrown synthetic fuels with Japan’s
first demonstration plant at its Yokohama research facility that opened in late
September 2024. Each day, the facility produces about one barrel of synthetic gasoline
and diesel, entirely from renewable electricity-derived hydrogen and captured CO2,
using the FT synthesis method.

This success now sets the stage for the next phase: building a pilot plant that can
produce 300 barrels per day by 2028. ENEOS expects to embark on full-scale
commercial operations by the early 2040s, citing cost barriers.
ENEOS’ synthetic fuels demonstration plant













Source: ENEOS

ENEOS plans a gradual move away from its existing petroleum business, to evolve in
lockstep with the creation of cost-competitive infrastructure to make green hydrogen in
Japan, and also store and transport the fuel.

So, while ENEOS is working on its own tech to boost yields from the FT catalyst and
realtor, and optimize the process of collecting feedstock, it’s mostly relying on progress
elsewhere to make e-fuels work as a business proposition.

Rival Idemitsu Kosan has taken a different approach by partnering internationally to
forge an e-methanol supply chain. In collaboration with shipping giant Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines (MOL) and e-fuel producer HIF Global, Idemitsu plans to capture industrial
emissions in Japan, transport them to renewable-energy-rich locations overseas, and
then import the end-product – e-methanol.
Idemitsu’s strategic partnership agreement with HIF Global aligns it with a company
that produces e-fuels in North and South America, Australia and other regions. This bet
on securing overseas supply of e-methanol also won METI’s stamp of approval.
Idemitsu’s $114 million investment in HIF Global in 2024 was later partly covered by
state-run JOGMEC, which put $36 million into the Idemitsu subsidiary making the
investment.

The interest in e-methanol comes from the e-fuel’s versatility. Once in Japan, Idemitsu
sees options to convert it to synthetic gasoline or aviation fuels, banking on demand
from either the shipping sector or aviation.
The investment in HIF aims to build a global e-methanol supply network that could
start procurement from the second half of the 2020s. Idemitsu’s Hokkaido refinery is
lined up to work with e-methanol in the latter part of this decade. Whereas ENEOS is
keen to improve FT synthesis, Idemitsu sees better gains via improving CO2 electrolysis.

As discussed in the other Analysis story in this issue, Idemitsu is simultaneously banking
on the development of biofuels via ATJ (Alcohol to Jet) and HEFA (Hydro processed
Esters and Fatty Acids) technology to feed SAF demand. Thus, the company should be
able to offer both bio and e-fuel products.

Interestingly, the two Japanese refiners have a three-way MoU with Saudi Aramco,
signed in August 2023 to cooperate on the technical and practical application and
diffusion of e-fuel.
Cost conclusions
None of these innovations will have a chance to take root unless costs are reduced, and
this is where e-fuels have difficulties. While the drop-in application of e-fuels is a boon
that means existing petroleum infrastructure can be utilized, current production costs
are skewed by high hydrogen and carbon capture estimates.

Government estimates put the price of e-fuel at around ¥300 to ¥700 per liter – well shy
of the ¥100–200 target by 2030. For comparison, regular gasoline retailed for ¥184.5 in
February.

The ongoing CfD auction should help supply more affordable volumes of hydrogen and
related energy carriers from 2030, while nationwide CCS projects are also due to start
around that time. These two developments could change e-fuel economics. However, if
most of the imported hydrogen is ‘blue’ rather than ‘green’, will the environmental
benefit of e-fuels still stand up?
In theory, there’s market interest in e-fuels from various transport sectors. In practice,
the evolution of e-fuels in Japan relies either on a cheap overseas supply chain or big
domestic leaps in cost-performance and tech. In the meantime, battery performance
metrics forge ahead.

The pilot e-fuels plant launched by ENEOS was indeed a breakthrough. Whether it has
made a real impact is up for debate.

As Japan Begins SAF Production, Obscure Okinawa Crops
Seen as Key to Supply

Until recently, Okinawa’s most famous liquid exports were watery lager and awamori, a
fiery rice spirit enjoyed locally but little-known abroad. Now Japan’s southernmost
prefecture may soon be contributing to a far more ambitious liquid revolution:
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The prefecture’s little-known subtropical plants hold
surprising potential to help Japan’s aviation sector.
Cleaner-burning fuel is critical to meeting the climate targets of Japan’s aviation sector,
one of the world’s largest. While testing new aircraft designs that run on entirely new
fuels such as hydrogen will take years, international rules demanding that airlines cut
emissions are already in effect on a voluntary basis and due to turn mandatory in 2027.

Japan’s government has responded by setting a target that calls for all domestic flights
to use at least 10% sustainable fuel, or SAF, by 2030. This push is backed by domestic
refining firms. Next month, Cosmo Oil, in partnership with JGC Holdings and Revo
International, will start operating Japan’s first large-scale SAF plant at its Sakai refinery
in Osaka, turning used cooking oil into 30,000 kilolitres (kL) of clean-burning fuel a
year. This fuel will be made available at Chubu Centrair International Airport.
The problem is, much of the SAF produced today relies on used cooking oil (UCO), a
product limited by our ability to consume fried food. And while that appetite may be
substantial, it pales in comparison to the volumes of non-petroleum oils required to
support aviation. This is where a couple of obscure Okinawa plants come in.

Main SAF production methods
Technology              Major sources
HEFA (Hydro-processed
Waste oil and fats, beef tallow, pongamia, microalgae, etc
esters and fatty acids)
1st-generation bioethanol (sugarcane, corn); 2nd-generation
ATJ (Alcohol to jet)
bioethanol (nonedible plants, wastepaper, etc)
Gasification / Fischer-
Garbage (waste plastics, etc)
Tropsch synthesis
E-fuels                CO2, hydrogen
Market background
Japan's projected supply of SAF in 2030 is expected to be between 1.7 million and 1.92
million kl, based on METI data collated from domestic manufacturers. That should be
enough to comply with the 2030 target for 10% SAF blending set by the government.
Officials assume that 1.7 million kl of SAF will be required at that point.
Domestic refiners have a series of SAF projects in the works. In addition to Cosmo
Energy’s Sakai refinery:
•  ENEOS plans to add 400,000 kl of SAF capacity (feedstock; used cooking oil
and tallow; technology: HEFA1) at its Wakayama facility in 2028
•  Idemitsu will open 250,000 kl of capacity at its Tokuyama plant (feedstock:
biomass etc; technology: HEFA), also in 2028
•  Idemitsu also expects to secure a further 250,000 kl of capacity (feedstock:
ethanol etc; technology: alcohol-to-jet) in Japan and at overseas facilities by
2030
•  ENEOS is experimenting with e-SAF, a synthetic fuel produced from CO2 and
‘green’ hydrogen derived from renewable energy.
This rapid expansion is underpinned by demand from logistics firms like DHL Express,
which recently secured a contract to source 7,200 kl/ year from Cosmo, and Japan’s two
major air carriers, Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA).

And while the issue of cost is ever-present, the transport sector’s most daunting
challenge is how to secure sufficient quantities of SAF since there is a shortage of
feedstock. Municipal agreements, like Cosmo Oil’s 'Fry to Fly' project with cities such as
Suita in Osaka Prefecture, highlight community-driven collection efforts, though
volumes remain modest – Suita contributes merely 27,000 liters yearly, which is even
smaller in SAF terms.
Import solutions
A relatively small refinery company, Taiyo Oil is taking a different tack. The company is
investing about ¥200 billion into a brand-new facility in Okinawa that will turn alcohol
derived from Brazilian and American sugarcane and corn crops into SAF.

The company plans to use alcohol-to-jet SAF technology developed by American startup
LanzaJet. Output is forecast at 220,000 kl a year starting in FY2028. A portion of the
product could also be turned into renewable diesel.

The company is even considering exports, calculating that selling SAF to Taiwan and
other Asian neighbors may be as cost-effective as ferrying it to mainland airports in
Tokyo and Osaka.

Local bounty
Taiyo’s bigger industry peers are also interested in Okinawa, but for two different
reasons: the hardy subtropical plants Pongamia and Terihaboku. Non-edible, drought-
resistant, and capable of flourishing in poor-quality soil, these plants offer excellent
prospects for mass cultivation without encroaching on agricultural land needed for
food.
Pongamia, a robust, oil-rich legume, thrives in the harsh climates of tropical and
subtropical regions. It requires little fertilizer, tolerates salty, poor-quality soil, and has
the potential to significantly enhance soil quality through nitrogen fixation. Critically,
Pongamia yields substantially more oil per hectare than traditional oilseed crops like
soybeans, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable fuel source.

Terihaboku, another subtropical gem found abundantly in Okinawa, also boasts
impressive oil content of up to 50% in its seeds. Historically used for cosmetics and
traditional medicines, its high oil yield and adaptability to poor soils and coastal
conditions make it another ideal candidate for mass cultivation in the SAF domain.
Idemitsu Kosan has launched Japan’s first overseas Pongamia trial plantation, working
with U.S. agricultural firm Terviva. Covering around 50 hectares in Queensland,
Australia this trial aims to demonstrate Pongamia’s viability as a scalable, long-term
feedstock. Idemitsu sees big promise, particularly because Pongamia oil yields per
hectare significantly outperform other oilseed crops, emitting roughly half the carbon of
soybean-based fuels.

Given Okinawa’s similar climate and abundant marginal land, the island could
potentially support extensive Pongamia and Terihaboku cultivation. The oils extracted
from the plants could then be processed into SAF at refineries that use HEFA
technology. This would greatly contribute to Japan's SAF requirements while also
reducing the nation’s reliance on fuel imports, a useful bonus at a time of continued yen
weakness and energy security concerns.
Another domestic refiner, J-Oil Mills, claims it has already proved that Pongamia and
Terihaboku can be utilized as high-quality SAF. In late January, J-Oil Mills announced
that SAF produced entirely from these plants’ oils had been assessed and passed
international standards, qualifying as high-quality fuel suitable for aviation. The
company even managed to cut costs by using seeds gathered locally – often from
roadside trees.
Furthermore, by-products from processing the Okinawa plants (i.e. the husk and meal)
could potentially serve secondary roles as biomass fuel or animal feed.

Conclusion
Commercializing novel feedstocks like Pongamia requires substantial upfront
investment and years of cultivation trials. While current SAF production costs exceed
conventional jet fuel, thus limiting immediate adoption, momentum for sustainable
aviation is undeniably building.

The Japanese government often lauds the virtue of regional economic revitalization and
innovation. Encouraging Okinawa’s agriculture sector to cultivate SAF feedstocks could
provide dual benefits – reducing aviation's carbon footprint and delivering economic
prosperity to one of the country’s poorest regions and one of strategic importance for
national defense. That’s a goal worthy of raising a toast of awamori.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / BESS
Energy Vault Holdings acquired the 125 MW / 1 GWh Stoney Creek Battery Energy
Storage (BESS) from Enervest Group. Construction on the $220 million project begins
this year.
Australia / Solar and BESS
Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Australia acquired a 190 MW hybrid solar PV and
energy storage project in Victoria from Acen Australia. The project features 140 MW of
solar PV generation, with a 50 MW/ 100 MWh 2-hour battery energy storage system
(BESS).

China / Solar power
Kuwait and China agreed to cooperation in renewable energy and solar plant
technology. China will oversee the development of the third and fourth zones of the Al-
Shagaya and Al-Abdiliya solar farms.
India / Nuclear power
India plans a nuclear plant in Gorakhpur, Haryana. Initial approvals were given in
2008, but delays occurred due to disagreements with French stakeholders. Now the
project has renewed vigor and determination to see to fruition.

India / Thermal power
JSW Energy inked a power purchase agreement for its 1.6 GW coal-fired thermal power
plant to be built in Salboni, West Bengal. It’s scheduled for commissioning in five
years.
Indonesia / Palm oil
Indonesia will raise its palm oil export levy to between 4.5% and 10% of the reference
price, up from 3% to 7.5%, to finance an increase in the amount of the oil used in
biodiesel.

Malaysia / Gas power
Worldwide Holding Berhad’s 1.2 GW Pulau Indah combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)
power plant in Malaysia began operation. The plant is about 60 km from Kuala Lumpur.

Philippines / Solar power and BESS
Actis closed its $600 million acquisition in Terra Solar Philippines. Actis, along with
Meralco PowerGen Corp and MGreen, plan to develop and expand MTerra Solar to 3.5
GW-peak of installed solar capacity and 4.5 GWh of BESS.
Singapore / SMRs
Experts say that SMRs are a good option for Singapore because it lacks the land and
raw materials to produce renewable energy at scale. SMRs are about a tenth to a
quarter the size of a traditional NPP. Singapore has the world’s most densely
concentrated data center hubs.

South Korea / Natural gas
Korean energy companies met with Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy, who visited Seoul
today and tomorrow, to discuss potential participation to develop gas fields in Alaska.
