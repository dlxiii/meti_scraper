| score |

•  The most points went to opposition parties calling for a total coal phase-out; those that didn’t
mention such a goal were penalized. Kiko’s evaluation reflected its critical stance on technologies
such as CCUS and hydrogen. Still, it favored Reiwa Shinsegumi's support for green hydrogen.
•  Parties like CDP, JCP, Reiwa Shinsengumi and DPP that set goals for renewables expansion (from
40% to 80% of the total power mix, depending on the party) were ranked favorably. In contrast,

the LDP and Komeito were penalized for not setting any clear target. For nuclear power, parties
were rated highly for stating goals to phase out NPPs; the LDP was penalized for seeking ways to
utilize nuclear power.
• TAKEAWAY: As an NGO with clearly stated antipathy to thermal and nuclear power, Kiko’s ratings are not a
surprise. Beyond a quick reminder of each party’s stance on energy policies, however, they are also useful as
an indicator of how the domestic climate activist community views both LDP’s policies and those of its
potential coalition partners. While a LDP victory on Oct 27 is highly likely, the party looks set to lose seats.

And, although the left-leaning parties that Kiko favors have almost zero chance of joining an LDP-led coalition,
they will have more influence in the Diet should the ruling party have a weakened position.



PM Ishiba states decarbonization action plan at AZEC meeting

(Government statement, Oct 11)
•  PM Ishiba attended the second Asia Zero-Emission Community (AZEC) Leaders Meeting in Laos.
•  Partner countries confirmed a statement to promote energy transition and decarbonization through
diverse and realistic pathways responding to each country's situation and to contribute to global
decarbonization. They also agreed on an “Action Plan for Next Decade” with the following three
main points:
•  Promoting “AZEC solutions”, such as visualization of GHG emissions throughout the supply chain,
transition financing, decarbonization of each industrial sector, etc.

•  Launching sectoral initiatives, including the Zero Emission Power Initiative and activities of the Asia
Zero Emission Center in the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia;
•  Promoting tangible projects led by Japan and Australia
•  CONTEXT: AZEC is a framework for decarbonization founded by Japan, and that includes ASEAN
countries (excluding Myanmar), as well as Australia, and which aims to develop technologies and
rules to meet the increased electricity demand resulting from economic growth, and to reduce

CO2 emissions. It was set up in early 2023 by former PM Kishida.


Regional hydrogen projects take off as companies work on details of 10 candidate hubs

(Nikkei, Oct 16)
•  CONTEXT: Japan has set a target to increase the supply of hydrogen and ammonia to 3 million
tons each by 2030, and designated 10 candidate sites to serve as hubs. Of these, three might be
near big cities and five in the regions, with the other two as yet undecided. This article discusses
the status of these supply chain projects.
•  Ibaraki Pref, Hitachinaka hydrogen and ammonia hub:
o  JERA aims to receive hydrogen and ammonia imports at its Hitachinaka thermal power

plant. Nearby ports, like Ibaraki and Kashima, may be deployed.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  The area’s demand for hydrogen (including ammonia) is projected to reach 1.25 million
tons annually by 2030.
o  Since May, JERA has been conducting a field study, with state support, in collaboration
with AGC and Nippon Steel to assess local hydrogen demand and infrastructure
requirements, such as storage tanks and pipelines.
•  Aichi Pref; ammonia hub:

o  JERA plans an ammonia import hub around its Hekinan power plant in Aichi.
o  By 2040, Chubu region’s local demand could reach 2.5 million tons annually.
o  JERA aims to distribute ammonia to nearby factories via trucks and ships.
•  Kansai Pref; hydrogen hub:
o  KEPCO is developing a hydrogen supply hub in the Himeji area, where it plans to import
100,000 tons of hydrogen annually starting in 2030.

o  Collaborating with JR West and NTT, pipelines are planned along railways to transport
hydrogen from Himeji to urban areas, and a gas distribution network to supply energy to
offices and commercial facilities.
•  Hokkaido Pref; ammonia hub:
o  Hokkaido Electric, in partnership with Mitsui Chemicals and Marubeni, plans to build an
ammonia import and storage base in Tomakomai by 2030. This will supply ammonia to
nearby power plants and food factories as a heat source.

•  CONTEXT: JERA’s broader goal is to increase the handling of hydrogen and ammonia to 7 million
tons annually by 2035, including projects in North America with ExxonMobil and CF Industries.

ENEOS exec says state subsidy fund for hydrogen insufficient to meet targets

(Japan NRG, Oct 16)
•  The ¥3 trillion that Japan allocated earlier this year to subsidize the production of low-carbon
hydrogen won’t be a sufficient incentive, said Tanaka Hideaki, head of Hydrogen Business
Development at ENEOS.
•  The amount set aside is supposed to subsidize domestic hydrogen production as well as the
import of clean hydrogen from abroad over 15 years. However, this money would only allow the
purchase of about 0.5 million tons of the fuel, Tanaka said during the Connecting Green Hydrogen

conference in Tokyo. Meanwhile, Japan’s target is 3 million tons of hydrogen by 2030.
•  Securing qualified personnel to develop hydrogen projects in Japan is a challenge, Tanaka said,
casting doubt on the country’s ability to have enough monetary and human resources to go ahead
with all of its hydrogen/ ammonia projects.
•  CONTEXT: The current plan calls for creating up to 10 hydrogen/ ammonia hubs around Japan.
JOGMEC is in charge of feasibility studies on each project.
• TAKEAWAY: Companies naturally seek to maximize the amount of state subsidies they can get for large-scale

infrastructure projects. Still, ENEOS’ position reveals a growing concern among firms involved in hydrogen hub
projects — that the state won’t be as generous as was first presumed, especially since with the recent change
of the PM and government. What’s more, the rising cost of infrastructure construction in the last two years has
further eroded how much hydrogen development the government can sponsor. From the state’s perspective,
giving funding to all parties is not efficient. Bureaucrats are aware that the subsidies won’t support all projects,
but they believe that the amount allocated is already substantial and cannot be expanded for now. The state

wants at least some hubs to go ahead and will encourage others to approach their projects on a more
commercial basis. The big sticking point, however, is that few firms in Japan today are willing to sign long-term
offtake for hydrogen or ammonia as the pricing mechanisms and future market developments are unclear.



NEDO-led P2G project in Yamanashi Pref

hopes to gain traction
(Japan NRG, Oct 17)
•  Yamanashi Hydrogen Co (YHC) seeks to
expand use of hydrogen and application of
its power-to-gas (P2G) system.

•  The firm was set up in 2022 to explore
producing, supplying, selling, and
providing services for hydrogen that’s
derived from renewables.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The hydrogen has been used by Hitachi Power Semiconductor Device, and other local firms. The
operators also offer hydrogen to local shops and small businesses via fuel cell batteries on a trial
basis.
•  The Yamanashi Model P2G System is run in cooperation with TEPCO, Toray Industries, Hitachi
Zosen (renamed as Kanadevia on Oct 1), and Siemens Energy. The project is managed and

sponsored by NEDO.
•  CONTEXT: YHC utilizes a solar PV facility that was built in 2012 on Mount Komekura in Kofu City,
Yamanashi to power polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers.
• TAKEAWAY: The P2G System was launched to much fanfare about creating domestic trials for green hydrogen
production. However, due to the high cost of production, the company has struggled to find buyers. With local
demand well below capacity, YHC has looked to Tokyo industrial clients for offtake, but even that has not been
enough to sustain production on a daily basis. With some encouragement from the local authorities, Suntory

agreed to switch a local Yamanashi whiskey distillery to hydrogen boilers and to set up an on-site electrolyzer
facility with ten times the capacity of the YHC site. In that sense, YHC is conducting a promotional role, but
moving to a commercial basis continues to be a challenge.

IEEFA report on Santos’s CCS project raises doubts about feasibility
(IEEFA, Oct 16)
•  The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said that Santos, the Australian

oil and gas company, faces transparency challenges with its Bayu-Undan project that aims to
convert a near-depleted gas field in the Timor Sea into the world’s largest CCS facility.
•  Santos has not disclosed the costs and technical details. Also, it did not report potential emissions
offsets related to its Barossa gas project.
•  CONTEXT: The IEEFA is an NPO focused on the energy transition. It is skeptical about CCS as a
technology.
•  CONTEXT: Santos plans to sequester up to 10 MtCO2/ year. It sees Bayu-Undan as part of a

carbon trading hub, including CO2 imports from Japan and South Korea.
•  The Bayu-Undan project crosses maritime boundaries, raising legal and regulatory issues related to
CO2-leak liability between Australia and Timor-Leste. It involves moving CO2 over 800 km.

JX, JCOAL and Univ of Wyoming cooperate on CO2 mineralization

(Company statement, Oct 15)
•  JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration Corporation inked a MoU with University of Wyoming and Japan
Coal Energy Center to collaborate on CO2 mineralization.
•  CONTEXT: This process involves the chemical reaction of CO2 with water and rocks. It turns the
CO2 into solid minerals for safe underground storage, offering an alternative to CCS. JX is
advancing its "two-pronged" strategy. It involves both traditional oil and gas exploration, and

expanding into businesses like CCS/CCUS.
•  CONTEXT: Japan has the potential to store about 1.47 billion tons of CO2 in basaltic rocks. This
equates to 30 times the CO2 absorbed by its forests in 2022.
•  METI is also backing a project to inject CO2 into decommissioned natural gas fields, aiming for
launch by 2030.

Idemitsu Kosan, MOL, etc study CO2 absorption by seaweed cultivation
(Nikkei, Oct 17)
•  Idemitsu Kosan, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), etc are joining forces in a blue carbon project that aims
to absorb CO2 through seaweed cultivation. About 10 companies, including steelmakers and local

banks, will form a study group.
•  The initiative focuses on cost reduction and sharing experience on negotiating with fishing
cooperatives.
•  The study will explore automated technology for monitoring seaweed growth to reduce costs.
•  CONTEXT: Blue carbon refers to the process by which seaweed and seagrass absorb CO2, which
happens during photosynthesis, and then stores it on the ocean floor after they die. The CO2
absorbed can then be sold as carbon credits. While the concept is gaining attention, current high

production costs limit expansion.

EDF Trading becomes first foreign member in TOCOM futures market

(Company statement, Oct 15)
•  EDF Trading Japan, a subsidiary of France’s EDF, became the first foreign company to obtain a
trade member status for the TOCOM Electricity Futures Trading.
•  Electricity futures trading has grown over the need to hedge fuel price volatility and the entry of
major foreign companies; but a lack of liquidity has been a problem.
•  TOCOM now aims to increase liquidity and convenience for international investors.
•  CONTEXT: EDF Trading entered the Japanese power market in July 2020.
• TAKEAWAY: The Japanese electricity futures market has come to be dominated by the EEX with TOCOM

holding barely a few percent of the market share in terms of volume of trading. There are multiple reasons for
EEX surging ahead, including its faster response to client demands in terms of products and trading structures,
and a more international clientele and communication style. Still, many in the industry believe it is important to
have competition among trading marketplaces. Equally, overseas firms wish to have the flexibility to trade on
both the EEX and TOCOM, where the major power utilities have a big presence. EDF’s entry will likely be
followed by others in the sector, with several more international companies in the process of obtaining their
license to trade on TOCOM.




J-Power to sell U.S. fossil-fuel stakes, invest in renewables capacity betting on AI boom
(Nikkei, Oct 19)
•  J-Power plans to divest from its U.S. fossil-fuel power generation business, and will sell as many as
nine of 11 stakes in plants that it holds.
•  The funds earned from those sales will go to develop renewable energy projects outside Japan.

•  CONTEXT: Fossil-fuel assets account for 90% of J-Power's overseas generation capacity. The
company holds stakes in a total capacity of 2.5 GW in the U.S. which in April announced new rules
that require fossil-fuel plants to reduce GHG emissions.
•  J-Power will retain stakes in two new fossil fuel-fired plants -- one in Pennsylvania (launched in
2018), and one in Illinois (launched in 2022). These two have a high generation efficiency.
• TAKEAWAY: Another factor that’s motivating J-Power’s decision to sell is soaring electricity demand from data

centers due to the generative AI boom. Major tech companies plan to power their operations with carbon-free
energy, and in this context, fossil-fueled power plants are a liability.



EGC reports on operators with market dominance in electricity trading

(Government statement, Oct 15)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) reported on operators that are
likely to have a significant impact on electricity trading; these utilities are required to offer their
power supply on the spot market at a marginal cost.
13



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  They were assessed in October 2023, and again this year. Among these operators are major
EPCOs and their group companies, including Hokkaido Electric, Tohoku Electric, TEPCO Energy
Partner, JERA, Chubu Electric Miraiz, Hokuriku Electric, KEPCO, Chugoku Electric, Shikoku Electric,
and Kyushu Electric.
•  The assessment is based on power generation share and supply capacity. But the power regular

noted that it is discussing changing the current methodology.
•  CONTEXT: Under the “Guidelines for Appropriate Electricity Trading”, those listed as “operators
with a high likelihood of market dominance” are required to sell their surplus electricity on the
JEPX spot market at a price based on marginal cost.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
EGC: no discrimination among large utility groups in wholesale electricity trading

(Government statement, Oct 15)
o  The EGC verified that Kyushu Electric showed no unfair practices internally or to clients
unrelated to its group in the wholesale electricity trading for FY2024.
o  For FY2025 and beyond, eight companies plan to supply the majority of their supply
capacity to the wholesale market.
o  In addition, they will allocate about 10-20% or more of their sales volume to long-term
wholesale, and plan to increase this ratio in the future.
o  The next follow-up verification is scheduled in the first half of FY2025.

o  CONTEXT: The large utilities' policy of "no discrimination to buyers whether inside or
outside the group" is key to fair competition in the electricity market. EGC requires that
the generation divisions of large utilities treat their group retail divisions or companies
and external business partners (as in, new power companies) equally.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
EGC reviews correctional imbalance fee for 2025 and beyond

(Government statement, Oct 15)
o  The EGC begins reviewing the C and D values of the correctional imbalance fee for
FY2025 and beyond.
o  Regarding the C-value, the limit for imbalance fee, generation companies and TSOs have
requested that the current value of ¥200/ kW be increased, as this would provide an
incentive to ensure that planned values for simultaneous generation are met, but retail

electricity companies have expressed caution about the increase.
o  The D-value, the standard for the imbalance fee when supply/ demand starts to tighten,
will be discussed to determine whether it is an appropriate level from the perspective of
incentives to achieve the same amount as the planned value.
o  CONTEXT: The imbalance fee is a unit price used by TSOs to adjust for excesses or
shortages in electricity supply / demand, and is normally the marginal price of balancing
capacity. However, during periods of tight supply/ demand, the imbalance fee increases

as costs are loaded to secure additional emergency supply capacity.
o  The following values are used to calculate the correctional imbalance fee during periods
of tight supply/demand:
▪  A-value: Set at 3% as the minimum level of supply capacity;
▪  B-value: Set at 10% as the level in preparation for the risk of a decline in supply

capacity;

14



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

▪  B-dash-value: Set at 8% as the standard for tight supply/demand;
▪  C-value: This is the maximum price of the imbalance fee calculated as the cost of

securing an additional 1 kWh of supply on an emergency basis. The price for DR
is estimated at ¥600 yen/ kWh, but ¥200/ kWh is applied based on the highest
price of past wholesale power market contracts;
▪  D-value: This is the marginal price for B-dash and is set at ¥45/ kWh as the cost
of securing the Power Source 1-dash.

(Nikkei, Oct 15)
•  Girasol Energy, a startup at the University of Tokyo, is revitalizing aging solar PV plants operating
for nearly 30 years. Girasol works with the Yamanashi Pref and uses proprietary analysis tech to

locate areas that need repairs and restoration of power generation without replacing PV cells.
•  The firm worked on a facility in Hokuto City, Yamanashi that was launched in 1994 but shut in 2022
due to deterioration and breakdowns. Girasol restored it using digital tech to reconfigure wiring to
improve power generation performance.
•  CONTEXT: Concerns are rising that after agreements under the FIT expire, operators will give up
on maintaining and operating solar power plants, and the facilities will be abandoned. Girasol

hopes to extend facilities’ performance up to 50 years. The company will operate 18 power plants,
with a capacity totaling about 1 MW.

JERA submits EIA for thermal power station construction plan
(Company statement, Oct 17)
•  JERA submitted a draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Chita Thermal Power
Station Units 7-8 construction plan. It involves decommissioning units 1-5 among the existing six
units.

•  New units 7 and 8, with an expected gross thermal efficiency of 64%, will be built.
•  The draft details environmental surveys, evaluations, and conservation measures, and will be
available for public inspection starting Oct 18.


16



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: JERA won an LTDA (long-term decarbonization power capacity auction) contract for
this power plant back in January, but soon after hinted that it might withdraw as realized that the
deal might not be favorable. LTDA guarantees winners a certain income but gives little upside for
additional profits.
• TAKEAWAY: The news suggests that JERA still hasn’t decided to go ahead with the two units at Chita or not,

and it seems to want to keep options open; so, it proceeded with the EIA for now. This uncertainty is not ideal
for either the plant operator or regulator OCCTO, as it makes longer term capacity planning difficult. JERA
may be holding out for some concessions, but it’s not clear what these could be.

KEPCO wins NRA approval for long-term operation of Takahama NPP
(Company statement, Oct 16)
•  KEPCO won NRA approval for changes at Takahama NPP Unit 1 that relate to safety regulations for
aging.
•  CONTEXT: An aging evaluation is required at Takahama Unit 1 before it reaches 50 years since

launch (November 1974). The company must formulate a long-term management plan for an extra
10 years beyond the 50-year mark.
• TAKEAWAY: This would be the first time that a Japanese NPP receives approval to operate beyond the 50
years mark. Globally there are only about 30 NPPs in operation for more than five decades. When dealing with
old plants, operators face equipment deterioration. Thus, KEPCO is trying to be as careful as possible. This is
seen in the recent manual shut down at the NPP after discovering holes in the plant's piping.

ANALYSIS

BY MASUTOMO TAKEHIRO
Interview with Sato Hiroki, Senior Managing Executive Officer,

Division CEO of Global Business Division, Chubu Electric Power Co, Inc.
Chubu Electric is one of Japan’s biggest power utilities, serving the central region
that’s home to major automakers including Toyota Motor. The utility is also a 50%
owner of JERA, Japan’s top operator of thermal power plants and the world’s biggest
LNG importer.

With the full liberalization of Japan’s power market in 2016, Chubu Electric has
expanded its business outside of the central areas and into new sectors. These include
entry into the burgeoning carbon capture industry and investments into renewable
energy. The company is also putting more effort to grow its business internationally,
and two years ago set up a Global Business Division to seize on worldwide
opportunities in energy.

Q: How important is the international business for Chubu Electric?
A: The Global Business Division currently has around 90
members, both here and overseas; there are 50 in
Nagoya, and 20 each in Tokyo and overseas.


When I transferred from JERA in 2021, Chubu Electric
had just announced a long-term strategy, called
“Management Vision 2.0,” that aimed at consolidated
profits of ¥250 billion by 2030. It was clear that only half
of this could come from its domestic power generation
business. The rest would need to be from new
businesses and from overseas. That’s why this division was created.

Our focus is on two main areas: investment and consulting. All overseas business
activities are managed by this division. Some projects, like the CCS (Carbon dioxide
Capture and Storage) initiative at Nagoya Port, are based in Japan but linked to the
global value chains, so we also handle those. By 2030, this division will take an
important role in generating half of Chubu Electric’s consolidated profits.

Our goal is to make strategic investments of ¥400 billion by 2030. Of course, there's a
time lag between investment and returns, so in the near term, our division seeks to
generate profits of ¥10 billion by the second half of the 2020s. So far, things are
progressing very smoothly.

We currently have 12 investment projects (including the CCS project under
consideration, and NuScale for which a final investment decision has been made), and
8 consulting projects. Of these, the majority were initiated since the establishment of
the Global Business Division in 2022.

It’s not always smooth sailing. For example, we decided to invest in a small modular
reactor developer, NuScale Power in the U.S., but shortly after they had to walk away


22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

from their first project, and their stock plummeted. But overall, we’ve managed to
participate in the projects that we really wanted to pursue.

And the other important thing to say is, all our overseas projects will be related to
decarbonization.

Q: Which overseas projects seem particularly promising?
A: There are three that, if we can see them through, could become real game-
changers and contribute to global decarbonization.

Carbon Capture
The first is a CCS project at Nagoya Port that we are currently advancing with BP. This
involves capturing CO2 from various industrial facilities around the port, transporting
it overseas, then storing and monitoring it. This is a "blue" project, to borrow global
phraseology. What's interesting is that European countries, which previously would
not accept anything other than “green” (i.e., renewables-based) energy, have started
to adopt a more pragmatic view since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and are now
less interested in the color-based definitions.

While the U.S. never had an issue with it, Europe seemed to outrightly dismiss CCS
technology as an excuse for extending the lifetime of fossil fuels. Now, look at the
UK’s North Sea: CCS projects are lining up there! We can't achieve decarbonization
only through renewables. I firmly believe that we need to include physical carbon
capture and storage in our strategies.

At the Nagoya Port site, we've completed the feasibility study (FS), but we still don't
have all the necessary components for the project to become a full-fledged business.
Japan’s government said it will impose carbon taxes starting 2028, and there's also
talk of forming an emissions trading system similar to the one in the EU starting 2026.
Without these [components], CCS won't be viable as a business. Ideally, we'd like all
the costs to be covered by subsidies, but that's not realistic. So, in order for CCS to
work on a commercial level, we need carbon to have value.


Q: How much investment is currently anticipated for the CCS project in Indonesia?
A: We believe that by 2050 about 20 ships with tank capacities of 50,000 to 80,000
cubic meters of CO2 will be needed. Just that alone is a quite substantial investment.
It's certainly not a project on the scale of several billions or tens of billions of yen. It
will be larger, possibly with two more digits. This is why it’s crucial to see how far the
government’s carbon pricing mechanisms will support the value of carbon. To put it
simply, if emitters are asked to pay a carbon tax of ¥10,000 per ton, but they have an
option to pay Chubu Electric ¥8,000 per ton to handle CCS, they’d naturally choose
the latter, right? Without such a comparison point, this project cannot move forward.
However, the government is concerned that introducing a ¥10,000 carbon tax right
away might negatively impact the economic condition of industries. That is a bit
frustrating. In the EU, they don’t bother with such debates anymore — they've already
mandated fines for companies that don’t adopt CCS. If Japan is serious about
decarbonization, legal frameworks like these are essential.

Q: Will you require state subsidies to make the CCS business work?
A: I don’t want to ask for subsidies from the start. I want to run this as a business
within a mechanism that properly addresses both global environmental issues and
23

Japan’s NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) target. What we need instead is a
well-designed system.

There is also responsibility for us as operators to structure the project well. For
example, if we can get several entities to share the use of the CO2 carriers, operating
rates will increase, and costs go down. So, if others want to join us and work together,
we’re open to that. It doesn’t matter if they’re domestic or international entities.

Our cooperation agreement with Indonesia is non-exclusive, meaning it’s not a
restrictive contract. We’ve completed the FS with BP, but as for dividing the roles and
responsibilities moving forward, that’s still to be decided. We might also work with
partners other than BP. Regarding storage locations, I believe it’s essential to secure
more than just the Tangguh site. Relying on a single point of storage isn’t good for
security. That storage may involve BP or others.

Nuclear
The second potential game-changer is the SMR (Small Module Reactor) project with
NuScale. We had decided on the investment, but the actual remittance hasn’t
happened. That’s because approval is still pending from CFIUS (the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the U.S.). Once that approval comes through, we’ll invest. I see
nuclear energy as a clean energy source, so I consider it essential. It’s extremely
difficult for Japan to survive without nuclear power, and to make a difference we need
to adopt safer, more advanced nuclear tech options like SMRs.

Chubu Electric is the only utility globally to have decided on an investment in SMRs.
The others that have invested in SMRs are not power utilities. [NOTE: Chubu Electric’s
only nuclear facility is the Hamaoka NPP, which the government asked the company to
shut down shortly after the Fukushima disaster, claiming it could pose a risk in case of
an accident. Chubu has invested billions of yen into upgrading the Hamaoka NPP
safety measures, but it has yet to win approval for a restart].


At Chubu Electric, we believe both traditional nuclear tech and new options like SMRs
should coexist. It’s also valuable to have optionality.

Geothermal
Our third game-changer is a geothermal project with EAVOR, a startup from Calgary,
Canada, established in 2017. We became the first Japanese company to invest in
them in 2022. I think EAVOR’s geothermal technology is revolutionary.

Geothermal has traditionally been considered a risky business. The chances of drilling
into the ground and finding steam is about one in three. The cost of failure is
expensive. EAVOR's technology, however, doesn’t rely on steam; it requires heat.
Their closed-loop system circulates water, capturing heat without depending on the
geological layers, which reduces the risk of missing the target to a negligible level.
The project we’re working on with EAVOR in Geretsried, Germany, leverages this
tech, utilizing geological data from another company's failed attempt at a
conventional geothermal project on the same site.

Despite being the third-largest geothermal resource holder globally, after the U.S.
and Indonesia, Japan generates less than 1% of its power from this energy source.

There are also many restrictions to new developments, but this closed-loop system
allows the energy projects not to compete with the hot springs owners for the steam.
With the German project underway, we hope to bring the tech to Japan.

Big tech companies are demanding only clean energy supplies, but their data centers,
etc need reliable and stable electricity. I think nuclear or geothermal are the solution.
By the way, Microsoft has also invested in EAVOR, and recently, [Japanese
construction major] Kajima also joined as an investor.

We’re looking at scaling this new geothermal technology to hit 10 GW of installed
capacity. That’s equivalent to 10 conventional nuclear reactors. I can’t give a
breakdown of how much of that will be in Japan, but we’d like to hit this target
globally.

In Japan, two local governments have already shown significant interest in this
technology and are asking us to develop projects in their regions. One municipality
has even conducted an on-site inspection.

Q: What are your plans for the consulting business? You have projects in that space in
Africa.
A: Africa is not just the next market but the market after the next market, so we’re
keeping a close eye on that region. Currently, we’re only involved in consulting in
Uganda and Mozambique, which are JICA projects related to ODA. But we want to
link consulting work to making investments, and everyone is working with that
mindset. If things go well, I hope to announce something soon.


Q: How do you view your relationship with JERA — are they a competitor or a
partner?
A: While we have a capital relationship, JERA is a separate entity, so they’re a
competitor. To put it bluntly, we see them as competitors, and ultimately, we want to
win. It’s an arm’s-length relationship. But, just like with other entities around the world,
there will be cases where we form a consortium and work together.

Q: The next Basic Energy Plan is expected before April 2025. What are your
expectations?
A: I expect it to reflect trends in data center/ AI power demand growth and
electrification. A recent IEA report shows that the global electricity demand of data
centers in 2026 will be equivalent to something like the power consumption of Japan.
Also, the current global electrification ratio is 20%, but the IEA and other major
energy outlooks estimate that for net zero by 2050 it needs to reach 50%. In short,
decarbonization requires more electricity. If we don’t address these two things in the
supply side, we won’t be able to keep up.

I also hope the new Plan has a more realistic outlook on the cost of power. Recently,
people are talking more about the system's cost of electricity, rather than the cost of
generation as a standalone. So, a photovoltaic facility by itself may achieve costs of
¥3/ kWh. But as we use more solar, the cost of power transmission and battery
storage also needs to be accounted for. As such, we need to look at the cost of
integrating new facilities into the system.

Finally, I hope the offered energy mix will be more realistic. Nuclear power is part of
that. The current target for nuclear power is 20-22% of the mix, but in reality, we have
a lot less. The government needs to broaden its commitment so that its targets
become more achievable.

ANALYSIS

BY THOMAS SHOMAKER
Solar Developers Look to Nascent P2P Trading to Revive Flagging Profits

Peer-to-peer energy trading, in which consumers and businesses produce and sell
electricity between themselves, appears poised to take off in Japan. Two peer-to-peer
(P2P) initiatives, one already underway in Gunma Prefecture and another kicking off
next month in Ehime Prefecture, have brought Toshiba Corp, the JA Group and Itochu
Corp into collaboration with local governments and dozens of homeowners with solar
panels.

The common thread for these separate initiatives is TRENDE, a solar installation and
energy trading company set up by TEPCO six years ago, but now owned by Itochu.
The startup has developed a blockchain technology that facilitates P2P transactions.

Due to Japan’s high population density and rapid expansion of solar power in the
years after the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, there is a high potential for P2P
energy trading to assist the country in meeting carbon-reduction targets, especially as
solar power installations have slowed since the 2022 phase-out of the Feed-in Tariff
(FIT). As selling excess energy directly to users via a P2P platform is generally more
profitable than selling it back to the grid, P2P trading could help stimulate another
wave of solar energy expansion.

While there have been previous P2P projects in Japan, they mostly focused on
developing the microgrids and blockchain technologies that support the system.
These new initiatives stand out as practical pilot projects that bring together
consumers, EVs, factories and agricultural facilities. And both of the new projects have
been designed for scalability.


Background on P2P energy trading
The 2012 introduction of Japan’s renewable energy FIT vastly expanded domestic
solar power capacity, which in 2011 provided just 0.5% of the country’s total energy.
By 2023, this figure was nearly 11% and Japan had reached the world’s third-largest
installed solar capacity.

As of March 2024, three-quarters of these installations were sub-10 kW systems on
top of private homes or on small plots of land, meaning a vast network of Distributed
Energy Resources (DER). Because of this, new domestic energy retailers and start-ups
began eying P2P energy trading soon after the concept took off in the later 2010s.
(Fig. A)

As the FIT transitioned to a Feed-in Premium (FIP) model in 2022, renewable energy
generators began to see diminishing returns from power sales. The recent excitement
around P2P trading is largely because it potentially offers a way to maintain revenue
from power sales while re-incentivising solar installations.

Japan’s earlier P2P initiatives were generally proof-of-concept experiments, like in
2019-20 when TRENDE teamed up with Toyota and the University of Tokyo in


27

connecting 19 Shizuoka Prefecture households with nine plug-in hybrid vehicles to see
if P2P transactions could both lower electricity bills and provide reliable power.

The Ehime and Gunma Pref projects
The Ehime project could be described as a larger version of the 2019-20 experiment.
Under the prefecture’s “Try Angle Ehime Initiative,” TRENDE and Toshiba have been
awarded a grant to connect 30 solar power-equipped homes with six EVs that will
commute to a Toshiba factory in Matsuyama City. The verification period will run from
the end of November to the end of February 2025.

The EVs will be Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cars that can share information with the
other V2Xs while exchanging power with the P2P trading platform. Excess energy will
therefore be purchased by the factory during times of high demand when it’s most
expensive. The direct P2P transactions means the households will obtain higher profits
than they would ordinarily get from grid sales while the factory procures energy at
below-market rates.

The ongoing Gunma project is a commercial energy trading service born out of a
collaboration between trading house Itochu and the Japan Agricultural (JA) Group,
the nation’s top farmers cooperative, to find decarbonization solutions.

TRENDE, which became a consolidated subsidiary of Itochu in 2023, is again
providing the platform for the P2P transactions. In collaboration with the JA Group’s
electricity retailing firm, ZEN-NOH Energy, solar power is generated at various JA
facilities, including A-COOP supermarkets, gas stations, agrivoltaic installations,
offices and farmers’ homes. It is then distributed via the TRENDE’S P2P exchange
hosted by ZEN-NOH Energy. (Fig. B)


That platform uses AI to forecast demand and blockchain technology to facilitate
direct energy transactions between these “prosumers”, meaning individuals, stores
and facilities that both produce and consume power. This is done in communication
with batteries from Itochu’s “Smart Star” series that also use AI software to optimize
charging and discharging by learning consumption patterns. Further energy exchange
is carried out by the EVs, which may be stationed at various JA facilities.

Potential to scale
Both the Ehime and Gunma projects have scalability in mind.

The Try Angle Ehime Initiative has the goal of solving regional issues through digital
solutions, and if the P2P project’s verification period is deemed a success, the target
recipients will expand in Matsuyama City and then across the prefecture.

The Gunma initiative is already a commercial energy trading service, albeit with a
relatively small footprint. TRENDE told Japan NRG that the results are checked
monthly and that the intention is to scale nationwide via the ZEN-NOH network.

The ultimate goal is to have commercial P2P energy trading microgrids connect
communities across the country with JA Group’s roughly 1,000 A-COOP supermarkets
and 36,000 JA Cooperative organizations with roughly 10 million official and associate
members.

If such a scale is achieved, it would essentially mean that everyone in Japan will be not
far away from such an energy hub. At the very least, in cases of a local grid failure at
times of a natural disaster or similar, these facilities underpinning the P2P hubs could
become lifelines for local communities. Furthermore, energy could be brought into
distant areas by EVs or battery-equipped mobile supermarket vehicles. (Fig. C)

This vision is in line with the national government’s recent efforts to push localities to
introduce renewable energy in public facilities that can be used in times of disaster.

Challenges remain
Because of the success of earlier P2P proof-of-concept experiments, all entities
involved in these two initiatives are confident of their ability to scale. But some
challenges to P2P growth in Japan remain.

For one, while Japan has a high density of DERs, they are concentrated in peri-urban
areas outside of the country’s urban cores, which are dominated by highrises and have
limited options for solar PV installation. Therefore, the flow of energy will remain one-
sided in many parts of Japan, although city dwellers should still be able to procure
power at below-grid prices if their energy retailers host P2P platforms.

Another challenge is Japan’s slow adoption of EVs, which accounted for just 2.2% of
new car sales in 2023, far behind China, the U.S. and Europe. Despite the sluggish
growth of the EV market, the sales trend is upward and the nearly 90,000 EVs sold
during 2023 was an annual record.


A final hurdle is that the 10 major power utilities, EPCOs, which control most of the
national power grid, have varying degrees of openness to innovative electricity
trading. These P2P projects have essentially sidestepped such negotiations, securing
prefectural support in Ehime and by working with the JA Group-backed ZEN-NOH
Energy in Gunma.

A METI report in June showed that 103 new local power companies — which tend to
be more open to market innovation — have been established since 2010. But large
parts of Japan still have limited energy options.

While P2P energy trading is a relatively new concept, the idea of decentralized power
grids has been around since DERs first began to provide meaningful amounts of
energy. The concept had previously relied on traditional gatekeepers to provide the
market. Should Ehime and Gunma projects expand as planned, however, P2P energy
trading may spread in Japan faster than the solar installations that have made it
possible.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Wind power and BESS
Sweden’s OX2 acquired a proposed 1 GW onshore wind farm in West Australia that
includes a 100 MW co-located BESS. Planned to be built near Perth, the project is in
the early stages and its size is not finalized. This is OX2’s first onshore wind project in
Australia.

China / LNG trucks
Analysts said the swift rise of natural gas-powered trucks, particularly heavy-duty
vehicles of 14 tons and more, is thrusting China past peak diesel demand. China
Securities estimated the country’s LNG truck fleet would displace about 9.2 million
tons of diesel consumption in 2024, equivalent to 4% of last year’s demand.

Data centers
Delta Electronics plans to build its own energy plants in India and Thailand, as the
world's leading provider of power management technologies aims to decarbonize its
global supply chain. The company said that Thailand and India are the two most
challenging countries to access enough green power.

India / Energy plan
India seeks to be a global energy leader, aiming to reach 2,100 GW of capacity by
2047. Towards that goal, the Central Electricity Authority launched a National
Electricity Plan that calls for 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, reaching
600 GW by 2032.

India / Renewable energy
As of October, India’s energy sector recorded 201 GW of renewable generation
capacity, accounting for 46% of the nation’s total installed capacity of 453 GW. Solar
accounted for 91 GW of new installed capacity, wind for 47 GW, large hydro 47 GW,
small hydro power 5 GW, and biopower added 11 GW.

South Korea / LNG
To strengthen its LNG supply chain, South Korea inked a MoU with Singapore for an
LNG swap agreement to leverage their complementary seasonal demand patterns
and enhance pricing power through joint purchases.

Taiwan / Clean energy
The Minister of Economic Affairs proposed to invest in renewables in the Philippines
and transport the electricity back to Taiwan via submarine cables in order to address
domestic energy supply constraints and meet growing demand for green energy from
international technology manufacturers.

Vietnam / Data centers
South Korea's Hyosung plans to double its investment in Vietnam, with an additional
$4 billion slated for data center expansion. Hyosung also has stakes in Vietnam’s
renewable energy, power grids and power equipment sectors. South Korea is the
country’s leading foreign investor.
