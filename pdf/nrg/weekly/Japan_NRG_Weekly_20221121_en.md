MoE unveils aid package for loss and damage from climate change
(Government statement, Nov. 20)
•  At COP27 the Environment Minister announced Japan’s aid program to help reduce loss and
damage from climate change.
•  The program includes disaster preparedness, relief and risk insurance, forecasting tools, best
practices and other knowledge sharing.
•  Rather than offering new financing schemes, the ministry offered to set up an early warning system

through a public-private partnership. The system would work with the UN’s existing early warning
system initiative, MoE said.
• TAKEAWAY: The UN Climate Conference has just concluded with a tentative agreement reached between
developed and emerging economies, as noted in our Global Wrap. That agreement is largely about new
financial assistance to developing nations affected by climate change. In contrast, Japan’s offer in regards to
“loss and damage”, published earlier on in COP27, was largely discussing existing programs and new systems

that will be built by Japanese firms.


METI proposes extension of “trial phase of carbon pricing”

(Japan NRG, Nov. 14)
•  METI proposed to the panels for green transformation and carbon neutral energy to extend the
trial phase of carbon pricing because industries aren’t ready for full launch. “Carbon pricing may
have negative impacts on our economy without an understanding on how it impacts Japanese
competitiveness,” METI said.
•  METI suggested 2026, the year after the UN review of National Determined Contributions of each

country, as the new timeframe for full introduction of carbon pricing, which will combine an
emission trading plan and other measures.
•  MoE told the panelists that the carbon tax, which METI opposes, is still an option.
•  CONTEXT: PM Kishida’s government has said that Japan needs ¥150 trillion in investments this
decade to decarbonize, which is larger than the ¥140 trillion plan set out by the European Union.
• TAKEAWAY: Originally, the carbon trading that started in trial mode on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
supposed to be fully operational in April 2023. This was always an overly ambitious target, driven more likely

by political considerations. Japan is due to host the G7 next year and PM Kishida likely wanted to announce
that the country has successfully set up a carbon trading system that will drive decarbonization. However, a
delay to the original timeline was evident a few weeks ago after the latest meeting of the GX panel chaired by
PM Kishida. That meeting called for FY2026 as the deadline for the creation of “full-fledged trading” of carbon
credits in Japan.

• It’s clear that carbon trading as it stands at the moment is too disorderly to be rolled out on a broader scale. At
worst, a quick national rollout would debilitate businesses and cause a pushback against the instrument. One
of the challenges today is how to integrate the different types of credits. While each represents one ton of

4

CO2 equivalent, the sector and efforts made to cut that ton of emissions vary wildly. To find some form of
common ground, METI is joining forces with the MoE and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to
design a hybrid carbon pricing system that combines an emissions trading scheme and payment charges.



Japan Hydrogen Association proposes “low carbon hydrogen” standard
(Japan NRG, Nov. 16)
•  Since hydrogen of various colors have emerged, the Japan Hydrogen Association (JH2A) proposed

to METI a standard for “low carbon hydrogen”.
•  Low carbon hydrogen will emit less than 3.4 kg of carbon/ kg, and its carbon value represents
emissions from well-to-gate, covering Scope 1 and 2, and some aspects of Scope 3 emissions.
•  JH2A plans a review after five years to reflect technological advances.
• TAKEAWAY: This standard is in line with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive. Aligning with the JH2A moves,
the Clean Fuel Ammonia Association (Japan) plans to revise its low-carbon ammonia standard, which stands at
0.84 ton of CO2/ ton of ammonia and applies to gate-to-gate release.


International “low carbon hydrogen” standards
EU Renewable energy directive                      3.4 kg CO2/kg

EU Taxonomy for sustainable finance                 3 kg CO2/kg
UK low carbon hydrogen standard                    2.4 kg CO2/kg

U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, clean hydrogen production standard 0-4 kg CO2/kg


Chemical sector needs 3.5m tons/ year of hydrogen to go green
(Japan NRG, Nov. 16)
•  The chemical sector needs between 3.5 to 4.6 million tons/ year of hydrogen for its fossil fuel

sources to be completely replaced by the molecule, the Japan Chemical Industry Association told
METI panels on hydrogen and ammonia.
•  4.6 million tons of hydrogen is required if ethylene production remains at around 6 million tons/
year, and 3.5 million tons needed if output was cut by 25%.
•  22-29 million tons/ year of ammonia is needed for it to replace fossil fuels.
•  CONTEXT: The sector consumes over 6 million tons/ year of coal, 3.8 million kiloliters of oil and
3.8 bcm of gas.

• TAKEAWAY: The Association said its survey of chemical companies showed investment to drive carbon
neutrality will amount to ¥9.7 trillion, more than its previous ¥7.4 trillion forecast, and almost at par with the
investment required by the steel sector.



Mitsui asks for government involvement to support blue ammonia
(Japan NRG, Nov. 16)
•  Mitsui, Japan’s largest ammonia supplier with a 60% market share, told METI panels on hydrogen
and ammonia policies that government involvement is required in three areas to propel building of
blue ammonia supply chains.

•  Mitsui proposes a first-movers support program to drive new projects, financial support to
suppliers to meet consumers’ price requirements, and active JOGMEC involvement to discover
new CCUS sites.
• TAKEAWAY: METI plans to support an international ammonia and hydrogen supply chain, but it noted that
different support programs are required for building them locally. On reference price points to provide

subsidies, METI proposes using the coal price as a reference for ammonia and the LNG price for hydrogen,
due to a lack of established benchmarks. This may drive reporting agencies Argus, S&P among others to
engage closer with the hydrogen and ammonia communities, to spread their pricing data.




JOGMEC  and INPEX to demo clean hydrogen and ammonia with CCU in Niigata
(Company statement, Nov. 15)
●  JOGMEC and INPEX began a demo in Kashiwazaki-city, Niigata Prefecture, to produce clean
hydrogen and ammonia, along with CO2 storage and utilization.
●  The gas from INPEX’s field in Minami-Nagaoka is sent to the Hirai area in the Higashi-Kashiwazaki

gas field, and is used to produce hydrogen and ammonia.
●  The CO2 from the production process will be separated, captured, and injected into a depleted
gas reservoir in the Hirai area.
●  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JOGMEC updates name to include energy security dimension
(Company Statement, Nov. 14)
o  Old name: Japan Oil, Gas, and Metals Corporation

o  New name: Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security
o  Change reflects the state company’s greater role in procuring energy for Japan through
added responsibilities in geological surveys for offshore wind development, investments
in hydrogen, fuel ammonia, and carbon capture and storage, and domestic processing of
rare metals.

MoE and UAE sign agreement
(Government statement, Nov. 14)
•  The MoE and UAE’s Ministry of Climate Change and Environment signed an agreement on climate
change, air quality management, waste management, biodiversity, and other areas of

environmental protection.
•  CONTEXT: A consortium led by Itochu is building a 194 MW power plant in Dubai that will be
fueled by household and industrial waste generated in the city.



METI wants large cargo consignors to file 2030 decarbonization goals

(Japan NRG, Nov. 16)
•  METI plans to ask cargo consignors that shipped over 30 million tons in 2021 to file their 2030
decarbonization goals and report on progress annually from 2024.
•  The goals will include the target percentage share of “non-fossil fuel vehicles” used to transport
cargoes and installation of charging stations on their premises.
•  Details of biofuel and efuel vehicles will be discussed separately.
•  CONTEXT: The national goal is to introduce 5,000 large electrified trucks in the 2020’s, and

150,000 EV charging stations and 1,000 FCV charging stations by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: “Non-fossil fuel vehicles'' is a new concept that comprises EV, FCV, PHEV, but also biofuel and
synthetic efuel vehicles, which are different from the former in that they are not primarily based on battery
power. Discussions continue on whether to include HV (hybrid vehicles) among the non-fossil fuel transport.


Vehicle classifications
Electrified vehicles            EV, FCV, PHEV, HV


Non-fossil fuel vehicles EV, FCV, PHEV, biofuel/synthetic efuel vehicles, HV (?)

2040 All new car sales will be either electrified or non-fossil fuel vehicles To be set in 2030



LDP asks GX Council not to uniformly limit lifetime of nuclear reactors

(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 16)
•  An LDP parliamentary group to promote sustainable power supply submitted a suggestion to the
GX Implementation Council to make the replacement and construction of next-gen reactors a
matter of national nuclear policy.
•  They are against a uniform limit of 40 or 60 years for all reactors, and want to decide each
individually. The group said the uniform limit was “non-scientific”.

Japan strengthens green ties with Indonesia at G20
(Various sources, Nov. 15)
•  Japan agreed to provide loans of up to $500 million to help Indonesia introduce more renewable

energy and expand its power grid. This was announced after a meeting between PM Kishida and
President Joko Widodo.
•  The accord is part of Kishida’s Asia Zero Emission Community program that allies Japan’s net-zero
pathways with those of other Asian countries.
•  The cooperation with Indonesia spans solar, wind, hydrogen and ammonia, and is seen as helping
Japanese companies export their related tech to the Southeast Asian country.
•  CONTEXT: Indonesia considers stopping new coal power plant construction from around 2025.



Mitsui plans to find sites for carbon storage in Asia-Pacific region

(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 16)
•  Trading house Mitsui wants to secure sites in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere to store as
much as 15 million tons of CO2 a year.
•  The trading house wants to set up a supply chain by 2035 that would transport emissions captured
at Japanese factories and power plants to oversees sites for storage.
•  CONTEXT: CO2 can be stored in oil and natural gas fields that have run dry. But Japan has few

such sites.

7.76 GW of solar power capacity may lose license
(Japan NRG, Nov. 15)
•  Some 66,973 solar power stations with a total capacity of 7.76 GW will lose their licenses at the
end of March 2023 for failing to meet facility installation deadlines.
•  If operators prove construction works are in progress, or have started connecting to the grid by

Feb 28, then they qualify for extensions.
•  CONTEXT: Last year METI announced changes to the FIT permit rules that seek to eliminate a
situation in which operators simply sit on an older, high-priced FIT contract without moving
forward with the work.
• TAKEAWAY: Changes to FIT rules caused consternation to the solar market last year and for a while froze the
financing for many projects that had yet to start the construction work. It also put additional pressure on
developers that had yet to secure a grid connection – a process that’s largely in the hands of the local grid

company. Despite the above, the overall aim of the ministry was of benefit to the solar market’s longer-term
development: Officials tried to cancel high-price FIT permits acquired by firms for the sake of speculation and
resale.
• Once “dormant” licenses issued when the FIT rates were much higher are canceled, the solar market should

rebalance and give a more accurate picture of the domestic solar industry. For an in-depth review of the latter,
see this week’s Analysis section.



PPA-based, roof-mounted solar takes off in Kyushu
(Nikkei, Nov. 15)
•  More and more companies in Kyushu and Okinawa, including JR, Mitsui Fudosan, and the town of
Tagawa, are utilizing power purchasing agreements to mount solar panels on their roofs.
•  Under the PPA, the property owner pays zero for installation but commits to purchasing electricity
generated at a flat rate for a period, usually 15 years.
•  Tariffs under PPAs are a few yen cheaper than standard commercial tariffs.

•  Land suitable for solar farms is increasingly scarce, resulting in a significant increase in the number
of roof mounted panels.



Retailers raise prices for rooftop solar households amid struggle to secure volumes

(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 17)
•  High wholesale market prices are pushing electricity retailers to secure more volumes from
households with rooftop solar as the volume of green electricity in the market remains tight.
•  CONTEXT: Households that installed solar panels form 2012 were offered high guaranteed prices
for their surplus volumes to encourage more supply of green power to the market. However, those
FIT-based prices were only for 10 years and many of the contracts are expiring.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  With the current FIT prices less than a quarter of where they were a decade ago, households saw
their income from selling surplus power drop. But the shortage of volume in the market is pushing
power retail companies to offer households a better deal.
•  Starting Nov 8, Tokyu Power increased its offered price from ¥10.9/ kWh to ¥12/ kWh for
households in the Tokyo area. From August, Marubeni Power Retail had a hike of ¥1/ kWh in all

areas.
• TAKEAWAY: There is a continuous migration of Japanese corporates to green electricity, at least for part of
their purchasing volumes. This is sucking up power volumes faster than green electricity projects come online.
Mizuho Financial Group, for example, recently announced plans to switch its power contracts at 200 domestic
locations to green electricity in order to cut its corporate GHG footprint. Mizuho is one of the top three
financial groups and runs energy-intensive data centers. While such a big client switching to green power is

good business for a firm like Cosmo Energy, which provides Mizuho with electricity, it also necessitates a hunt
for new sources of clean energy. For now, this is helping the households that installed rooftops get a better
deal at least for the surplus power they can sell.




Cosmo offering EV leases bundled with green electricity
(Nikkei, Nov. 16)
•  Cosmo Energy Holdings began marketing packages that bundle leases on EVs with carbon-neutral
electricity sourced from wind farms.
•  Prospective clients include major banks and local governments.
•  The venture will allow Cosmo to utilize its existing network of gas stations while also transitioning

to a lower-carbon business model.



Mitsubishi Clean Energy takes lessons from Europe on the FIP market
(Nikkei, Nov. 17)
•  The CEO of Mitsubishi Clean Energy, Fujii Takao, said that under FIT renewable generators could
sell the electricity they generated at good rates, so they only needed to concentrate on

developing more capacity.
•  Under the new FIP program tariffs fluctuate with the market, complicating revenue forecasts. This
can make lenders reluctant to finance renewable projects, said Fujii.
•  Mitsubishi acquired a 60% stake in Irish energy company ElectroRoute, and will use the expertise it
gains from the deal in the Japanese renewables market.
•  Fujii says Japanese operators can learn much from European counterparts about controlling

output, selling products, and meeting consumers’ expectations.
•  Fujii attributes the weak bidding on the FIP market to lower subsidies (the result of reductions in
generation costs) and the need for operators to assume risks related to fluctuations in market
prices, which makes many cautious. It’s a challenging market for operators that lack relevant
expertise, he says.

A Case Study in Local Energy: One Town’s Failed Biomass Dreams
Over the past decade Japan has vigorously promoted biomass energy as a clean and
renewable form of energy. But since the start of the war in Ukraine in February this
goal has acquired added urgency due to the U.S.-led sanctions meant to punish
Russia.

If all goes according to plan, Japan hopes it will be able to replace Russian crude oil
imports, which pre-war met approximately 4% of the nation’s needs, with biomass
energy.

Obstacles abound, however, and there’s reason to be uncertain that these goals can
be met, unless Tokyo takes the necessary action to resolve labor shortages, and
consistently generates large volumes of feedstock that are required to build a strong
supply chain. The labor-intensive biomass sector requires a sizable workforce.

Also, there are a myriad of issues to tackle on the municipal level; from securing the
necessary permits, to earning approval from cautious and reluctant local residents
who are concerned about changes in their lifestyle.

Ironically, the same local resistance that plagued Japan’s nuclear power industry for
decades is now increasingly a problem for renewables operators, including biomass
energy firms. Local residents are naturally concerned that new large-scale projects
might disrupt their lives.

Take the case of Mihama in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan. At first, a decade ago, the
town of 22,700 residents was eager to leverage its prospering agriculture sector in
order to develop a biomass economy. Those efforts, however, eventually floundered
as hopes turned into disappointments and enthusiasm in the local community
withered. The result is a cautionary tale for innovative renewable energy companies.


Power from manure
Located south of Nagoya, and surrounded by calm seas and hills, Mihama’s economy
has long rested on commercial fishing and agriculture, especially its fruit farms. The
area has hot and humid summers, and mild winters.

Mihama attempted to transform into an incubator for biomass/biogas processing firms
that wanted to develop energy from waste. In 2012, Aichi Prefecture launched its
“Zero Emission Strategy” to reduce GHG levels and at the same time foster new
industry growth. The main idea was to utilize untapped biomass resources such as
waste from food processing and households, as well as wood and bamboo chips, and
livestock manure.

Mihama was selected as one of the sites to test a power generation system fueled by
methane that's derived from livestock manure. Local pig farm, Suzuki Yoton, offered
land for a facility and Ebara Manufacturing agreed to provide processing equipment.

Studies showed that 199,500 tons of dairy cow manure collected in Mihama and nine
neighboring towns could generate 5.98 GWh of power, which is enough to power
about 1,383 households. Mihama alone was generating over 60,000 tons/ year of
livestock manure.

However, these plans went nowhere. Feasibility studies concluded that the installation
and operating costs were too high. There was a lack of scalability options to bring the
costs down through volume. And so, the largess of Mihama's manure supply was left
unused. The project was suspended and removed from the Aichi Zero Emission
strategy.


Local opposition derails another biomass project
Another chance to develop biomass appeared in 2013. This time, the plan was to use
human waste for power generation. Mihama planned to introduce a centralized sewer
system, which meant a constant supply of biomass feed.

Since 1952, Mihama has had running water, but the town lacked a sewer system. Even
in the 1980's many newly-built homes had no flushing toilets. Instead, toilets were
connected to septic tanks in the backyard. Waste processing firms collected this
household waste.

In 2014, the town mayor proposed a sewer system. Tokyo backed the plan with advice
to trim building costs, but the town still had to foot the bill. Fierce local opposition,
however, turned the project into a contentious issue in the 2015 mayoral election. The
incumbent lost and the sewer project was scrapped.

Why were residents opposed? Many felt that the sewer system’s ¥1 billion price tag
was unjustifiably high. After all, the town’s annual budget is just ¥7 billion. In addition,
there was little demand to upgrade the sewer system. As one resident said about her
septic tanks, which have automated sanitation features: “We invested in our system,
and it was a good investment. This technology is amazing.”


Bamboo blues
Another struggling biomass enterprise in Mihama is biochar production that makes
use of bamboo. To protect their crops, farmers have to cut down the bamboo that
grows wildly and rapidly. Bamboo waste can be heat-treated and made into biochar,
and then used as fertilizer.

The biochar production process releases CO2, about 50% of the biomass, but the
remaining carbon content becomes indefinitely stable and remains in the ground for
centuries, slowing GHG emissions. The technique has been used by Mihama farmers
for generations.

|  | Dairy cow | Meat cattle | Swine |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supply volume | 199,500 tons | 100,400 tons | 97,800 tons |
| Power generated | 5.98 GWh | 5.02 GWh | 5.87 GWh |

Unfortunately, the effort to continue the tradition has faltered and only a few farms
today continue with it. Despite support from the MoE, the number of farms applying
the technique has failed to increase.

The problem is establishing a stable supply chain. "Bamboo is everywhere, but the
scrap feed for biochar needs to be of a certain size and condition, requiring enormous
labor,” said another farmer. Since there are no financial incentives, at best some
retired farmers might make biochar for workshops and other events that happen once
every two or three years.


Inflation puts green energy on back-burner
Today, Mihama residents say they have bigger problems to consider than how to
introduce more renewable energy through biomass. The local agricultural sector has
been severely hurt by rising inflation.

But when the focus returns to green energy, biomass will struggle to attract local
attention after so many false starts over the years. Locals in Mihama say they lack the
volume and manpower to make biomass energy a local reality. A local waste
processing firm executive believes the town needs to have an area as big as Hokkaido
to make a biomass industry work.

As such, Mihama feels it has no choice but to look elsewhere. So far, the town hosts
over 200 small solar power stations, mostly below 50 kW. They’re primarily in the
Okuda district, just three kilometers from the troubled Minamichita solar site. (See the
Oct 31 issue of Japan NRG, “Burned by the sun: Learning from a local solar conflict”)

The realistic renewable options left are solar and on-shore wind, which also face
community opposition, the waste processing executive said. Unless a breakthrough
biomass feed or effective carbon pricing mechanism emerges and supports bio-
energy initiatives in small towns, the future of the sector in towns like Mihama is bleak.

If PM Kishida's government is serious about promoting biomass as an alternative
green fuel for power and transport, support needs to arrive in small towns like Mihama
and not just in national strategy documents and targets.

Can Solar Be Revived? The Shift to Smaller, Subsidy-Free Projects

Japan’s solar industry enjoyed stellar development in the early part of last decade
thanks to a state program to buy renewable power at a premium and a supply chain
built around domestic companies with world-leading technologies.

All that helped to strongly boost solar capacity within a decade and make Japan the
third-largest solar market behind China and the U.S. Over the last year, however, the
vibrant pace of development has slowed, even as the government made a further
doubling of nationwide solar capacity by 2030 the bedrock of its decarbonization
strategy.

Under METI’s Basic Energy Plan, solar is supposed to account for 14~16% of the
national power mix by the decade’s end. The annual capacity additions that are
needed to reach that target, however, look unlikely to materialize due to a number of
factors.


Basic numbers
Currently, Japan has about 66 GW in solar capacity. For the 2030 Basic Energy Plan to
be achieved, the installed and operational solar capacity needs to reach as much as
118 GW. That means about 52 GW of solar, or roughly 7 GW per year, need to be
added through 2030. Japan has installed 7 GW or more in solar capacity only once in
the last five years, according to IEA data.

A recent presentation by the Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association to a METI
committee suggests there’s reason to be concerned. Annual installations of new
residential rooftop solar have nearly halved and now average 145,000 homes. This
compares with an average of 272,000 additional homes between July 2012 and
FY2013.

The number may drop further as housing starts are expected to fall in response to
Japan’s declining population.

Residential solar (Less than 10kW) Installations by year

For non-residential solar (10kW and more), new installations in FY2021 totaled 3.7
GW, a 25% drop from the prior year. Approved annual capacity also has been on the
decline, with just 0.8 GW added in FY2021.

If these downward trends continue, Japan’s annual solar installations for non-
residential could drop below 2 GW. This could discourage solar project developers,
leading some to exit the market due to a perceived lack of growth potential. This
would then make it even more difficult to achieve the cost reductions that are needed
to make the industry self-sufficient, reports JPEA.

Utility-scale solar installation capacity (AC) each year (2012 to 2021)
















Utility-scale solar capacity that was approved by FIT

















Mounting challenges
Japan’s solar industry expanded quickly after July 2012 with the introduction of the
feed-in tariff (FIT) program, which pays a premium to renewable power producers. At
its peak in FY2014, the program helped Japan install 9.4 GW of solar.




19


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

As the tariff rates declined, however, and suitable locations for utility-scale solar
became harder to find, the number of installations has likewise deflated. METI
estimates that just 4.6 GW of solar (residential and utility scale) was added in FY2021.

Prices and land access are not the only issues.

Japanese manufacturers such as Sharp, Kyocera and Panasonic led early development
of solar panels and had large global market shares. Sharp, for example, was the
world’s top solar panel maker until 2006. But Chinese and Taiwanese rivals expanded
and by 2012 no Japanese manufacturer made the Top 10; their combined global
share dropped to 9% that year and slid to a paltry 1.2% by 2018, according to NEDO
PV Challenges.

Last year, Panasonic and Solar Frontier announced plans to exit panel manufacture by
March 2022 and June 2022, respectively. As a result, during FY2021 90% of panels in
Japan were imported, JPEA data show.

Cost: According to METI, the domestic cost of solar generation is on a downward
trend. Still, at ¥12/ kWh it’s more than double the global average.

Local Oppositions: The introduction of FIT led to a rapid solar expansion. This race to
grab a high-priced FIT permit led some developers to exploit woodland, mountainous
areas and other sites ill-suited to large-scale solar installations. This created a
pushback as residents started to oppose new projects and called for tighter
environmental rules. So far, more than 200 of the 1,771 local governments have
introduced ordinances to regulate development of renewable projects.


Room for optimism
Despite the challenges, JPEA believes Japan has room to claim 125 GW of solar by
2030. RTS, a Japanese solar research company, is even more optimistic: Should the
industry win more support and accelerate, then 140 GW can be in operation by 2030.

To get there, solar developers are moving away from large utility-scale projects, which
would typically convert a site such as a golf club, to more compact facilities with an
obvious and direct link to the end users of the electricity.

By around 2025, the share of solar not reliant on the FIT or its successor, the feed-in
premium (FIP) mechanism, will surpass those projects that rely on the tariffs, according
to RTS. This is due to a surge in business interest for direct contracts, such as the
power purchase agreement (PPA).

Under the FIP, power generators sell electricity at a premium to wholesale prices. The
PPA, or third-party ownership, model allows corporate users to lock in supplies from
specific generation facilities, which are sometimes located on their premises. This
secures both power and price, while reducing buyers’ carbon footprint and not
burdening them with ownership of the solar assets.

Another growth area for solar is privately owned buildings, a segment that is expected
to more than double in installation volumes. There are further gains for solar to be
made on rooftops of public buildings, incorporated in key infrastructure facilities such
as airports and roads.

20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

With greater awareness of climate issues and financial incentives, RTS expects new
residential rooftop solar installations to more than triple to 1.7 GW a year by FY2030.
One of the drivers for rooftop capacity is local regulation.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government is working on legislation obliging builders to
install rooftop PVs on new homes. Kawasaki City is looking into similar plans.

Meanwhile, the central government is trying to regulate solar sites in unfit locations,
hoping to avoid friction with rural populations, and make it more difficult to develop
solar farms on slopes and in forests.

Some municipal governments are also creating specific zones for renewables. At a
recent JPEA solar symposium, Kazuya Inoue, an MoE official for climate change issues,
said local acceptance is key: “We will do more with local governments and power
generators.”

In the face of extreme weather events, and high power and energy prices due to
Japan’s need to import fossil fuels, solar developers see a way to argue that installing
panels can both stabilize prices and add resilience to local energy systems.

Still, with most solar panels manufactured abroad, Japan could do more to make the
case that its solar output is based on the local-production for local-consumption
principle.

To win the hearts and minds of more local residents and governments, METI needs to
show that adding solar capacity is not just another bullet point on a bureaucratic
agenda but a real step towards energy independence and resilience for Japan.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

COP27/ Emerging economies
COP27 concludes with an agreement in principle to create a “loss and damage” fund
that will transfer financial assistance to developing countries hurt by climate-related
disasters. Emerging economies have asked for such a fund for over a decade.

Australia/ Renewable energy
Fortescue Future Industries will partner with Windlab on the North Queensland Super
Hub, which will generate more than 10 GW of wind and solar power. The project will
start producing power by 2027.

China/ Oil
China National Petroleum Corp, Sinopec and CNOOC signed purchasing deals worth
more than $66 billion with global energy giants during the 5th China International
Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai.

COP27/ India
India found support for its proposal for a global phase-out of all fossil fuels, as
opposed to the narrower deal at COP26 to phase out coal only. However, by the end
of COP27, the Indian proposal was still absent from the cover decision.

EU/ Russian oil ban
The EU expects to have regulations ready in time for the start of a G7 plan to cap the
price of Russian crude oil on Dec 5. Russian oil products will be banned from Feb 5.
The measure aims to punish Moscow for the war in Ukraine.

France/ Nuclear power
This year, about half of the country's ageing nuclear fleet (56 reactors) were shut due
to corrosion, summer heat waves or postponed maintenance. To help rectify the
situation, EDF and Credit Agricole signed a €1 billion loan for the maintenance of
nuclear power plants and to extend their operating life beyond 40 years.

Germany/ LNG
The first of four floating storage and regasification units, which can import 5 bcm of
LNG per year, was completed by Uniper on Nov 15 in the North Sea coastal town of
Wilhelmshaven.

Renewables/ Private investment
Private equity firm Carlyle Group formed a unit, Telis Energy, to build solar and other
renewable energy plants. Carlyle plans a project pipeline of 10 GW by 2030. Since
late 2018, the group has invested around $1.2 billion in renewables.
Russia/ Oil

Russian oil output is set to fall by 1.4 mbpd in 2023 after an EU ban on its seaborne
crude exports takes effect on Dec 5, said the IEA. The move will create more
uncertainty for oil markets and add to pressure on prices, including diesel.

U.S./ LNG
Freeport LNG blamed safety valve deficiencies and operating procedures as the root
cause of a pipeline explosion that shut its Texas plant on June 8. The company didn’t
indicate when the plant, which accounts for 20% of U.S. LNG exports, would restart.

U.S./ Solar energy
South Korea’s Hanwha Solutions will invest billions of dollars in building its own solar
supply chain in the U.S. Its Qcells unit is assessing sites in Texas, Georgia and South
Carolina for facilities to make solar components.

U.S./ EVs
General Motors said its EV portfolio will be profitable in 2025, when it expects more
than $50 billion from sales of 30 EV models. That will be more than a fifth of the
company’s $225 billion total revenue. By 2024 GM plans to make 400,000 EVs.
