ANRE sees need for another 15 GW in capacity by 2030 in revised supply-demand plans

(Denki Shimbun, Oct 30)
•  ANRE presented a review on power supply and demand management, focusing on revising
calculation methods for reserve rates in weekly power plans and reshuffling additional supply
measures.
•  Demand forecasts for 2030, excluding Okinawa, indicate a potential increase of up to 15 GW due
to growth in high-voltage projects driven by expansions in data centers and semiconductor plants.
•  Updates include: 1) changing the criteria for reserve power from a 5% to an 8% rate; 2) renaming

“demand-supply tightness support” to “inter-area adjustment”; 3) switching operation of pumped
storage to T&D companies
•  New measures for the JEPX exchange were also discussed, including independence for the market
monitoring office, and a new spot trading system to improve trade capacity by the end of FY2024.
• TAKEAWAY: An additional 15 GW of capacity would be a tall ask if this refers to baseload power. It’s more
than the current demand stimulus on offer via the various state auctions, such as the Capacity Market. All this
indicates that much of the demand from data centers will need to be met through custom projects, or projects

sponsored by data center operators.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE discusses Basic Energy Plan in light of international trends and decarbonization

(Government statement, Oct 23)
o  ANRE held discussions on the Basic Energy Plan in light of current international trends
and decarbonized power sources and technologies.
o  Based on the World Energy Outlook 2024, the IEA has analyzed forecasts for natural gas
demand, the importance of mineral resources and energy security, and the need to
invest in decarbonized power sources amid rising electricity demand.
o  Decarbonized power sources also need to address issues such as recycling and disposal

of used solar panels, and the nuclear fuel cycle and final disposal of radioactive waste.
Also, CO2 atmospheric removal tech needs to be developed.
• TAKEAWAY: In the midst of growing energy uncertainty on the international stage, the next Basic Energy Plan
will also need to be flexible enough to respond to uncertainty.




Mitsui, Repsol, etc. launch CCS project in Texas
(Company statement, Oct 29)
•  Mitsui & Co, through its subsidiary MEP Low Carbon Solutions, formed a JV with Repsol and
Carbonvert that’s called Aves; it owns CCS rights to sites offshore Corpus Christi, Texas that covers
about 570 km2, and can store more than 600 MMT of CO2.
•  Repsol has a 45% stake in Aves; Carbonvert 45%, and MEP 10%. The site is in a 100-mile radius of
industries with over 35 Mt of annual CO2 emissions.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The CCS project will start in about five years, aiming to store up to as much as 30 tons
of CO2 in the next 30 years. Mitsui also has a CCS project with JOGMEC in Offshore Peninsular
Malaysia.
• TAKEAWAY: Spanish oil giant Repsol believes that the project is a chance to build a carbon storage hub with
environmental and economic benefits. Communities are concerned about potential risks from pipeline leaks

and high offshore costs, and their approval is a major challenge for the CCS industry. Critics also point out that
many CCS projects serve to boost oil production, thereby defeating the purpose of the energy transition.


















•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan to commercialize CCS by 2030 amid challenges
(Nikkei Asia, Oct 30)
o  Japan aims to commercialize CCS by 2030, making it central to its national energy

strategy. Nine Japanese business groups are conducting pilot projects, most in Japan
and Malaysia. The government hopes one or two projects will launch by 2030.
o  CONTEXT: Japan's carbon market expects large emitters to join emissions trading by
2026, creating high demand for CCS, whose costs remain high, ranging from ¥10,000 to
¥20,000 per ton. Japan expects to achieve commercial viability by 2040, when CCS costs
might fall below carbon prices. Wood Mackenzie predicts that Japan may need to store

80% of its CO2 abroad.
o  Japan plans to store 6-12 million tons of CO2 per year by 2030, aiming for 120-240
million tons by 2050. MHI is optimistic on this target due to its successful Texas CCS
project.
o  Challenges include Japan’s limited domestic storage sites and high costs for clean
energy needed to power CCS sites, as well as shipping costs for storage overseas.

ENEOS advances in synthetic fuel development with new pilot plant
(Nikkei Veritas, Oct 27)
•  ENEOS Holdings, Japan’s largest petroleum refiner, took a step to commercialize synthetic fuels,
launching a demo plant in Yokohama that uses renewable energy-derived hydrogen and captured

CO2.
•  CONTEXT: Synthetic fuel, produced by reacting hydrogen generated with renewable energy, can
offset its own emissions by reusing captured atmospheric CO2. Similar tech can be used to make
synthetic crude oil, refined into various fuel types like synthetic gasoline, diesel, and sustainable
aviation fuel (SAF).
•  The Yokohama facility is Japan’s first to synthesize fuel from raw materials on-site, with a daily
production capacity of one barrel. It uses direct air capture (DAC) to harvest CO2 from the

atmosphere.
•  Future scaling plans include a larger demo producing 300 barrels per day by 2027–2028, with a
commercial production target of 10,000 barrels per day by 2040.
• TAKEAWAY: This demo is a baby step and little more than a lab-scale experiment at this point. However,
Japan’s interest in synthetic fuels, which can utilize existing petroleum sector supply chains and infrastructure,
is very real. ENEOS’ domestic rival Idemitsu has invested in HIF Global, which is a synthetic methanol producer

with ambitions to produce 4 million tons annually by 2030. For now, the usual bottleneck of very high cost is a
drag on development. For the synthetic fuel era to launch, green hydrogen production costs must come down,
and that’s more likely next decade than this one.



KHI launches hydrogen-mixed gas engine test facility

(Company statement, Newswitch, Oct 30)
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries launched operations at its Kobe facility to test a large gas engine plant
capable of burning a 30% hydrogen mix, aiming to develop commercial hydrogen-blended models
by 2025.
•  The company plans to start land-based tests for a marine hydrogen dual-fuel engine in December
in Akashi, Hyogo, with over 95% hydrogen usage.
•  Supported by the Green Innovation Fund, the DF engine’s hydrogen mode is scheduled for 2025

after initial diesel-mode trials.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Noritz to test 100% hydrogen-fueled home water heaters in Australia
(Company statement, Oct 22)
o  Noritz, in partnership with its Australian subsidiary Dux Manufacturing and energy
provider ATCO Gas Australia, will begin a two-year trial of a hydrogen-fueled water
heater for residential use in December.
o  This test will take place at ATCO’s Clean Energy Innovation Hub in Western Australia,

where the company has been blending green hydrogen with natural gas for residential
supply, aiming to accelerate clean energy adoption.

Estratégia Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador to develop a geothermal power project in north

Ecuador, (generation capacity of around 50 MW).
•  The agreement supports Phase 1, preparing secondary infrastructure for the project site. The total
cost of Phase 1 is more than ¥7.8 billion, and the maximum loan amount is ¥6.582 billion. Phase 1
is scheduled for completion in August 2029. Phase 2 will involve building the power project itself.
•  CONTEXT: In October 2023, Ecuador faced electricity rationing. In 2022 domestic electricity
production fell short of demand due to long-term droughts and ongoing construction issues at a
hydropower plant. The country seeks to diversify power sources to reduce dependence on

hydropower, which fails during times of drought.



Kyoto Univ-affiliated Rhinoflux raises ¥200 mln to develop biomass tech
(Company statement, Oct 30)
•  Rhinoflux, a Kyoto University startup, has raised ¥200 million to commercialize tech that generates
electricity while capturing CO2.
•  Rhinoflux’s tech uses wet chemical looping to recover large amounts of electrical energy and high-
purity CO2 from poor-quality carbon resources.
•  The firm plans a prototype by late 2024. Commercialization is expected in 2028.

•  The tech’s main advantages are:
o  wet biomass can be used as a raw material for power generation;
o  allows for power generation at less than half the cost of existing biomass;
o  CO2 can be concentrated for CCUS without purification.
•  CONTEXT: Compared to other resources such as coal and natural gas, biomass has a low calorific
value and is expensive to use as energy.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Waseda Univ researchers develop high efficiency and durable aqua battery
(Organization statement, Oct 29)
o  A group of researchers from Waseda University, one of Japan’s most prominent
universities, discovered a highly durable anode reaction that causes very little
degradation; this enabled them to create a highly efficient and long-lasting aqua battery

Tohoku Electric restarts Onagawa NPP Unit 2

(Company statements, Oct 29-30)
•  On Oct 29, Tohoku Electric restarted Onagawa NPP Unit 2. The company switched the reactor's
operation status from fuel loading to ''startup''.
•  Tohoku Electric plans to proceed with inspections, tests, and other preparations. Electricity
generation into the grid is planned for early November.
•  Onagawa NPP Unit 2 reached criticality on Oct 30, at 00:12.
• TAKEAWAY: This is the first NPP to restart in East Japan since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. With the NPP back
online, east Japan power supply margins and stability should improve, which is especially important ahead of

this winter’s peak demand period. The restart also represents a significant investment in safety and public trust;
it follows major upgrades to mitigate risks from tsunamis and seismic events. Tohoku Electric anticipates large
economic benefits from reduced fuel costs. Still, the resumed operation reignites the question about spent
nuclear fuel storage. Local communities continue to express skepticism.



Share of nuclear power in national energy mix faces doubts as LDP battered in Diet election

(Nikkei, Oct 29)
•  Achieving the goal of nuclear power accounting for 20% of the energy mix remains a challenge.
Japan’s number of operational reactors must double from the current level.
•  The govt continues to support nuclear reactivation. METI hopes the Onagawa Unit 2 restart will
encourage further restarts.
•  Despite this progress, there are hurdles, including strict regulatory requirements following the

2011 Fukushima disaster. Some reactors, like Tsuruga Unit 2, have faced disqualification due to the
presence of active faults beneath them.
•  CONTEXT: The proportion of nuclear energy in Japan's energy mix has fallen about 30% in 2011
to about only 5.5% today.
•  The opposition, particularly the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), gained seats in this
weekend’s elections, revealing a growing resistance to nuclear power in regions like Niigata where
there is local opposition to the reactivation of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP.

• TAKEAWAY: National power demand is expected to rise in coming years due to the proliferation of data
centers and semiconductor factories. The Liberal Democratic Party promotes nuclear energy, but the CDP
emphasizes a non-nuclear future. If nuclear energy is to have a future in Japan it will need bipartisan support
and compromise. For more information on the Diet election results, check out the Analysis section in this
week’s issue.

OCCTO  proposes changes to power supply measures ahead of winter to avoid shortages
(OCCTO statement, Oct 23)
•  OCCTO proposed preliminary changes to power supply measures for this winter's tight supply-
demand situation, including ordering additional power activation, calculating a cross-regional

reserve margin, and better utilization of surplus pumped storage facilities.
•  The cross-regional reserve margin, which is the criteria for activation, will be raised from the current
5% to 8% in the case of switching to pumped storage power and starting additional surplus
capacity; and lowered from 8% to 5% in the case of increasing the output of thermal power. As a
result, the activation priority will be changed.
•  In calculating the cross-regional reserve margin, the supply capacity will include the day-ahead
balancing capacity and the anticipated use of surplus capacity in the Electric Power Reserve

Exchange (EPRX).
•  Regarding utilization of surplus pumped storage power in case of a lack of balancing capacity, the
measures that can be introduced quickly, such as negotiating contracts with the TSO, will be
discussed in tandem with the EGC.
•  CONTEXT: OCCTO manages and oversees issues related to supply-demand based on the status
of the cross-regional reserve margin. As far as additional supply capacity measures, the activation

order of power sources is reviewed, taking into account economic costs and the burden on power
producers and TSOs.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

KEPCO releases summary of investigation on Mihama NPP seawater system
(Company statement, Oct 29)
•  CONTEXT: On Oct 5, KEPCO operators noticed salt deposits on the return header in the seawater
system of the primary cooler of Mihama NPP Unit 3. There were small holes with thinning,
prompting an investigation. As a result, the unit shut down on Oct 15. There was no radioactive
impact on the environment.
•  KEPCO’s investigation showed detachment of the coating material near tiny holes in the pipe. The

"lining," a resin coating applied to prevent corrosion from seawater, has detached in sections of
the T-joint. Irregular corrosion patterns were observed on the carbon steel surface beneath the
detachment.

•  He led TEPCO at the time of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, and managed the aftermath. He
faced both criminal and civil lawsuits over his role in the 2011 disaster, with TEPCO shareholders
filing for damages.
•  Katsumata became TEPCO president in 2002, after the revelation of a cover-up of issues at the
plant.
•  CONTEXT: In a Tokyo District Court ruling, Katsumata and three other former executives were

ordered to pay over ¥13 trillion. The decision is now under appeal. He was also charged with
professional negligence. He was acquitted in both lower courts; an appeal is currently in the
Supreme Court.

Fukushima NPP debris removal resumes after one-month pause

(Asahi Shimbun, Oct 28)
o  After a month-long halt due to malfunctioning cameras, TEPCO resumed trial removal of
melted nuclear fuel debris from Fukushima Daiichi’s Unit 2.
o  The utility has since replaced the cameras, though the exact cause of the problem
remains unclear.
o  TEPCO aims to extract about three grams of fuel debris from Unit 2 for analysis.
o  CONTEXT: The operation was set to start in 2021 but was delayed, and only began on

Sept 10 this year.
• TAKEAWAY: Fuel debris removal is one of the most critical parts of Fukushima’s decommissioning. TEPCO
needs to proceed carefully and plan with great detail. Any change in debris removal needs NRA approval,
which only further prolongs the already late removal.



Vena Energy to build wind farm near Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP

(Company statement, Oct 25)
•  Vena Energy released an environmental assessment for an onshore wind farm (69 MW capacity) in
Kashiwazaki City, Niigata Pref .
•  Construction starts in May 2026; commercial operation is scheduled for May 2028.
•  CONTEXT: Kashiwazaki City is better known for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant that’s
been shut since 2011 but which might soon restart if it can overcome opposition from some local

residents.
• TAKEAWAY: With a push from the Kashiwazaki mayor, the region is seeking to diversify energy sources by
introducing wind power generation. There are a number of renewables projects planned in the area, which, if
built, could partially replace the idle capacity at the NPP and alleviate some of the power supply deficits.

NEWS:     OIL,  GAS   &  MINING





Mitsubishi Corp seeks to boost LNG production capacity through 2030
(Reuters, Nov 1)
•  Mitsubishi Corp forecasts that its LNG production capacity will increase by 5 Mtpa, reaching a total

of about 17 Mtpa by the early 2030s.
•  Mitsubishi has invested in a dozen LNG projects in various countries, such as new production in
Canada and existing projects in Brunei, Malaysia, Australia, Oman, Russia, Indonesia, and the U.S.
•  Mitsubishi currently has pro-rata ownership over 12 Mtpa, which is likely to reach 14 Mtpa in 2025
as the LNG Canada project comes online.
•  Mitsubishi reported a 33% rise in net profit for the first half of the fiscal year, partly due to LNG

sales and divestment from two Australian coal mines.
•  CONTEXT: Japan is seeing a decline in domestic gas consumption due to increased nuclear and
renewable energy use. Still, the country remains a major LNG importer, with Japanese firms
trading surplus LNG on the global market.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has a strategy to manage any excess in LNG supply by investing in Asian gas markets. It is
shifting from domestic reliance towards establishing a regional LNG trading hub for energy security. Thus,
Japan is securing long-term LNG contracts without resale restrictions.




JERA acquires 15.1% stake in Australia’s Scarborough gas field
(Company statement, Oct 31)
•  JERA completed a $1.4 billion acquisition of a 15.1% stake in Woodside Energy’s Scarborough gas
field in Western Australia; thus securing about 1.2 Mtpa of LNG from the project. This deal was

announced in February 2024 and now finalized after Australian regulatory approval.
•  JERA’s share of natural gas will be transported via a 430-km subsea pipeline to Woodside's Pluto
facilities. JERA and Woodside also signed a long-term LNG supply agreement, delivering 0.4 Mtpa
to Japan starting April 2026.
•  The project received financing from JOGMEC. The acquisition could pave the way for future
collaborations in low-carbon fuels and carbon capture.
•  CONTEXT: This adds to JERA’s established LNG projects in Australia, which supplies over 10 Mtpa

of JERA’s 35 Mtpa total LNG needs.



MOL hopes to alter contracts for LNG carriers and ice-breaking tanker in Russian use

ANALYSIS

BY MAGDALENA OSUMI
What’s Next for Japan’s Energy Sector After the Diet Election?

The stability that has underpinned Japanese energy policy for decades is now facing
doubts. Since losing its Diet majority last week, the ruling LDP has lost some control
over the implementation of its energy agenda, leaving it reliant on minority parties.

State-led initiatives and programs that rely heavily on state funding and rule-making
will face additional scrutiny and consensus-building, leading to potential delays. It also
puts the government in a weak position to dictate the next Basic Energy Plan.

In a blow to the new Cabinet, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party-Komeito coalition
lost its Lower House majority in the Oct 27 election, the first time since 2009 and a
rare occurrence in the past half century. The results show widespread dissatisfaction
among voters over energy and food price inflation and a recent slush fund scandal.

As Prime Minister Ishiba seeks to pick up the pieces, his government will need to take
greater heed of proposals from opposition parties and rely on ad hoc support from
lawmakers across the political divide. In such an environment, populist energy policies
and uncertainty over longer-term programs look inevitable. How PM Ishiba proceeds,
and how long he lasts in power, will cloud policy-making.


Results and the fallout
Despite choosing a leader seen as widely popular and even uncharacteristic for the
LDP, the ruling party fared even worse than some polls had warned prior to the
election.

The LDP and its junior ally, the Komeito, not only failed to retain their 259 seats, but
fell short of a stated target of at least 233 to preserve their Diet majority. In the end,
the two parties won a total of 215 seats. Of these, the LDP took 191. Meanwhile, the
gains were spread among several minority parties, but in a surprising turn of events
the biggest winner was the main opposition, the center-left Constitutional Democratic
Party.

PM Ishiba has said the LDP-Komeito coalition seeks to stay in power. To do so, the
coalition needs to form an alliance with a party whose main strategies, including
energy and digital transformation policies, align.

But despite sharing goals, neither the LDP nor the opposition parties are eager to fully
coalesce. Both the Democratic Party for the People and the Japan Innovation Party
(JIP) ruled out the possibility of joining a full-fledged coalition led by the LDP.

The only possible scenario in which the LDP could form an alliance, which would help
the LDP form a minority government, entails cooperation on a policy-by-policy basis,
and Ishiba is expected to ask the DPP for such support. Appealing to the intransigent
JIP is also an option.

Nuclear power as a key policy
The future of nuclear power was one of the few energy issues clearly articulated by
politicians before the Oct 27 election. The LDP-Komeito coalition pledged support to
reactivate Japan’s offline nuclear power plants amid expectations of a rapid growth in
electricity consumption with the expansion of data centers. The coalition has backed
the use of nuclear energy since its return to power in 2012.

In contrast to the LDP stance of being pro-nuclear, Ishiba made several comments
before winning election as party leader in September that suggested he would look to
phase out that controversial energy source and focus instead on renewables. He then
walked this back soon after after taking over as PM, but a week later he again spoke of
a real possibility for Japan to evolve without utilizing the atom for electricity.


Ishiba has also pledged to improve Japan's energy self-sufficiency and curb emissions.
The to-and-fro of his stance regarding nuclear could become even more distinct as he
now looks to minority parties for support. Volatility in the government’s outlook on the
sector may be reflected in the upcoming revision to the Basic Energy Plan, which is
expected to outline the nation’s energy mix target for 2040.

The updated Plan is slated to be finalized and disclosed by the end of March 2025.
Japan’s current 2030 power mix target has nuclear energy accounting for 20% of the
total; today’s actual share hovers around 8%. Meanwhile, the 2030 mix expects the
use of renewables to significantly increase to 36-38% of power supply.

So, what will the LDP’s potential allies dictate?

On nuclear, the main potential collaborators, the DPP and JIP, have been positive
about restarting existing nuclear stations, and also support development of new next-
generation reactors.

Last week, Tohoku Electric’s No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa NPP became the first
nuclear restart in eastern Japan since the nation’s nuclear fleet was shuttered in the
aftermath of the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. That takes the total units
restarted to 13 reactors, about a third of those deemed operable.

Building on this momentum and beginning the hard task of replacing old nuclear units
with new ones, as per the policy adopted by the LDP-led government in 2023, won’t

19

be easy. Before the October election, the JIP was discussed as a potential ally, and its
desire to further Japan’s digital reforms aligned with support for decarbonized power
sources including nuclear.

However, since the election, the JIP has been reluctant to join a LDP-Komeito
coalition. This could be an issue since the main opposition party, the CDP, is vocally
anti-nuclear and has agitated in regions like Niigata to grow local opposition to
reactivating Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP. The CDP has categorically ruled out any
potential cooperation with the LDP.

Ishiba’s uncertain fate
Ishiba, who unexpectedly won the LDP leadership race in September, said he intends
to retain his position but many around the central government bureaucracy are
skeptical of his prospects beyond the immediate future. Japan’s shortest PM term was
recorded in 1945, when Prince Naruhiko served just 54 days. Ishiba was inaugurated
as PM on Oct 1, 2024.

The decision whether Ishiba can keep the top spot depends on a vote at a special
Diet session to be convened as early as Nov 11. Both the lower and upper houses will
choose the next PM. Ishiba might ask the DPP’s Tamaki to help with his reelection,
fearing turncoats within his own party ranks who want him to resign to take
responsibility for the dismal election.

For now, the biggest gains are with the CDP, which won 148 seats, up from 98. The
party’s leader, Noda Yoshihiko, is a former PM himself (2011-2012) and said he is
open to forming a government with like-minded parties.


"If there is a political party that believes the LDP-Komeito government can’t continue
to exist, we’d certainly like to work with them," he said.

If successful, Noda could emerge as a new minority government leader.

A change in Japan’s decarbonization goals?
Whatever the political changes, the overall direction of Japan’s energy goals and
decarbonization strategy are unlikely to shift. Also, the 2050 net-zero commitment is
baked into law and widely supported across the political spectrum.

What could change are the approach and the timing. Stronger presence of the
opposition parties in the lower house, which is more powerful than the upper house,
will likely spark heated debates on energy security, the future of nuclear power, and
the role of renewables versus other decarbonization pathways, such as synthetic fuels,
hydrogen, etc.

The LDP designs policy at party level in coordination with big industry and brings
relevant ministries broadly in line with its thinking. However, that measure of control
looks set to dissipate. Instead, an LDP administration will have to review suggestions
such as, for example, DPP’s calls for deeper gasoline subsidies or JIP’s call for a more
serious carbon tax and carbon emissions trading system, as well as the use of more
international, market-based benchmarks in decarbonization funding.


20

In one scenario, the LDP could become entirely beholden to minority party requests.
Its current coalition partner, Komeito, failed to have its new leader win a seat in the
recent election as the party linked to the hugely influential Buddhist group Soka
Gakkai bore the brunt of conservatives’ dissatisfaction with the slush fund scandal. If
the current Komeito leader resigns and his successor decides to start from a clean
slate, the party may walk away from its LDP alliance.

In a time of compromises and horse-trading, the next Japanese government will tread
cautiously on big-spending programs, while certain niche proposals could suddenly
become mainstream. Such volatility is rarely welcome, but it will be the price for
staying in power.

ANALYSIS

BY ANDREW STATTER
Energy Jobs in Japan: Why is Hiring Statistically Harder Here

Japan has long been known as a tough talent market. Challenges such as an aging
population, long-term employment with large corporations, and a tendency toward
privacy are all frequently cited as challenges, not to mention the language barrier.

Companies, both international and domestic, often complain about a low volume of
qualified applicants for their job postings, and thus become frustrated with slow
hiring. In addition, they often receive profiles from senior generations and face some
of the highest agency recruitment fees globally.

Just how bad is the situation? Is it trending for better or worse? Let’s dig deeper into
this topic and finish with a few tips for companies looking to attract and hire talent in
Japan.

Language barrier drastically shrinks the relevant market
Guess who has a far easier time finding talent? Japanese companies! When dealing
with local partners or developing projects in the domestic market, the language
barrier is clearly not an issue. Yet, Japanese companies still face challenges in having a
smaller market than in other countries. Their market grows significantly when the need
for bilingual talent is off the table.


Of the 44 countries using TOEIC scores, Japan ranks 34th, with the average score
among test takers at 561, compared to a benchmark of 800 needed to be considered
business proficient. In a 2021 survey by Indeed, 6.6% of respondents claimed to speak
English fluently or business level. This figure doubles for those comfortable speaking
at a casual level.

Even if we chalk up these figures to the famous Japanese modesty, it’s safe to say that
only 10% of the total working population meet the requirements of ‘business
bilingual’, which is in stark contrast to most of Europe, the U.S. and Singapore.

Japan is getting older
The Japanese population is getting older, and it has been decades since the birth rate
was high enough to keep up. The working age population decreased by over 16% in
the last 30 years, from a peak of 87 million right after the bubble burst in the early
1990s to about 70 million today.

Compounding the depopulation challenge is the long tenures that Japanese tend to
have in their companies, especially their first company. About 55% of Japanese
professionals in their 20s have never changed companies, only dropping slightly to
42% for workers in their 30s. In their 40s there is a major shift, with about 80% of
workers having had at least one job change.

Let’s jump into the culture behind this. We see two major factors.
1. Firstly, Japanese corporate culture still has a strong idea of ‘lifetime
employment’. People often expect that they’re choosing a company for life

22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

when they take their first job out of university. Once in the company, they’re
assigned seniors who will guide, mentor and shape them, and they’ll hold
close ties to those who joined the company in the same year. Only 10-15
years later, when some of that group was promoted multiple times and others
were left behind, do workers start looking for opportunities elsewhere.
2. The second reason is tied to societal expectations. Stability, and working for a
strong, well-known (trusted) company are more important than holding a
senior position or earning a high salary, especially for young professionals.
Thus, many young adults in Japan opt to make major life decisions, such as
purchasing their first home, getting married, having children before
considering their careers and external opportunities.

Where are the women?
Gender is not the major problem in Japan as in neighboring China. Japanese females
outnumber males at 52%. This is not the case in all areas of the workforce, and
especially when it comes to the energy industry.

According to a survey of Aoyama Gakuin University, Sophia University, Chuo
University, Shibaura Institute of Technology and more, only 16% of students enrolled
in STEM subjects are female.

If we peel back one more layer, we see the issue is much worse. The bulk of females in
STEM subjects are studying topics related to healthcare and chemicals where the
student body is 20~25% female. Subjects most related to the energy industry are
among the lowest female enrolment, led by mechanical and electrical engineering at
8% and 8.5%, respectively. Information engineering and civil engineering fare a bit
better around 15%.

We also need to consider the ‘marriage cliff’ in Japan, where many highly qualified,
successful women in their 20s and 30s change careers following marriage and
childbearing. Due to systemic challenges in securing childcare, as well as expectations
that children should be enrolled in extracurricular activities, it's a major challenge for
working mothers to continue full-time professional activities. As a result, many
qualified women either change career tracks, or work part-time in their later 30s and
40s.


I am my company
In my home country of Australia, when I asked someone the standard opening
question “What do you do?” they’d answer with “I am an engineer, I am a banker, I
am a builder etc.” In Japan, however, the same question is typically answered by “I
work for Mizuho, Mitsubishi, a real estate company etc.” The Japanese culture and
mindset connects and prioritizes belonging to a company more than identifying with a
profession.

In another Indeed survey, 15.4% of Japanese respondents said they’d consider a job
change even though they were satisfied with their current company and role. Contrast
this to the opportunism in the UK and U.S. where the figures were 32.8% and 29.8%,
respectively.

When asked about changing companies for personal gain and progression, such as a
higher position, a salary increase, etc., the positive responses from Japanese were
23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

again about half of their Western counterparts. Their main reason was “when the
situation for the future at the company is hopeless,” and even then more than half of
respondents said they’d stay until they were let go.

So, the stories are real. What can we do about it?
Yes, Japan is an outlier when it comes to the talent market. Despite improvements in
language education, as well as state programs to get more women involved in
technology and into leadership positions, change is not keeping up with demand.

This is exacerbated in the energy sector by the increasing complexity as our systems
transition to renewable-based, distributed and managed digital technologies. Aware
of this reality, hiring companies should consider the following to successfully recruit:

• Respect your elders. Japanese love to work and take pride in it. Hiring five to ten
years older than you might elsewhere is a way to expand your talent pool.
• Offer flexibility. Hybrid working systems, flexible work schedules and benefits
such as extra childcare leave will help you tap into the pool of qualified,
experienced female talent.
• Focus on quality rather than quantity. Forget about getting 50 to 100 applicants
to your job advert, or even 10 CVs from your recruitment partner. A pool of three
to five candidates for most mid-senior positions who are strong enough to
interview will suffice.
• Be decisive. Recognize that the demand for talent is high, especially for those
who are visible on LinkedIn or job sites. Once you have that candidate engaged
and they meet your criteria, don’t play games waiting and comparing to others -
get them onboard!
• Sell the future. The statistics show that there are less young professionals on the

move in Japan, but it is not zero. Young talent can be attracted and will move for
the right opportunity, and that right opportunity must include a level of stability
for the future.

will add 150 GW of solar PV, wind and energy storage capacity by 2043. Total
installed capacity for those clean energy technologies is expected to rise from 52 GW
in 2025 to 208 GW by 2043, a 300% increase.

China / Electricity
The government reported that in the first three quarters of 2024 total national
electricity consumption was 7.41 trillion kWh, up 7.9%; but GDP grew 4.8% over the
same period. Cloud computing, AI, and EVs have driven the growth rate of electricity
consumption to be higher than the GDP growth rate.

China / Renewable energy
Three Gorges Renewables Group plans to build a massive power base that mixes
wind, solar, coal and batteries in the Taklamakan Desert, investing as much as 71.8
billion yuan ($10 billion), and which will include 8.5 GW of solar panels, 4 GW of wind
turbines, six 660-MW coal power generators and 5 GWh-hours of battery storage.

China / Oil refining
In mid-2025, PetroChina is set to shut the Dalian Petrochemical plant, which has a
total capacity of 410,000 bpd. It is the largest domestic oil refinery, and the first major
closure at a state-run plant.

India / Renewable energy
Adani Enterprises reported a more than seven-fold surge in Q2 profit, on higher
demand in its renewable energy division. Adani Group's flagship firm posted a net
profit of 17.42 billion rupees ($207 million) for Q2, up from 2.28 billion rupees a year
earlier.

Malaysia / Renewable energy
Sarawak state aims to become a renewable-energy leader and wants its skilled
workforce to return home. Starting 2026, the state government will offer to make
clean energy technology courses, such as hydrogen production and carbon storage,
free for locals.

Philippines / Renewable energy
Reuters reported that Singapore's GIC and Australia's Macquarie are looking to sell
their stake of roughly 30% in Philippine renewable energy firm Energy Development
Corp (EDC), a deal that could fetch $2 billion.

South Korea / Offshore wind
The government announced a much-anticipated tender for 2.8 GW of renewable
energy, including 1.5 GW of offshore wind capacity. About 1 GW is for bottom-fixed
offshore wind, with a further 500 MW allocated to floating wind capacity.
