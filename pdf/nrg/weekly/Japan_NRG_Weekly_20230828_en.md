Govt proposes multi-year GX budget of ¥2 trillion, Diet to approve in early 2024
(Government statement, Japan NRG, Aug 23)
•  The govt proposed a GX budget of ¥2 trillion over the next few years, as multi-year fiscal budgets
are now possible with the recent passage of the GX Promotion Act.
•  Aug 31 is the deadline to file the FY2024 budget to the Finance Ministry. Then the relevant
ministries will finalize the budget plan. Finally, it goes to the Diet in early 2024 for approval or

further amendment.
•  By the end of FY2023, the govt will come up with sector-specific action plans for achieving carbon
neutrality by 2050, which will build on the 22-sector investment strategy compiled earlier by the
GX Implementation Council.
•  Among the top priorities are strategies for mass production of perovskite solar cells (PSC) and
acceleration of next-gen grid development, as well as development of next-gen nuclear reactors.

PM eager to continue fuel subsidies to combat rising energy costs, ¥6.2 trillion spent to date
(Government statement, Aug 22)
•  PM Kishida has asked the head of the ruling party policy research council to hammer out policies

to mitigate rising energy costs, including a review of fuel subsidies that end in September, as well
as new economic packages.
•  A total of ¥6.2 trillion has been spent on fuel subsidies that ran from January 2022.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Businesses are divided on extending fuel subsidies. Some say the govt spent too much
on fossil fuel subsidies and more of the budget should go to carbon neutral solutions. Energy
intensive sectors such as semiconductors are asking for more state support. A combination of
programs may help balance different interests.
• TAKEAWAY: The fuel subsidy amount is enormous, but it should be viewed in the context of high energy

prices. Naturally, the higher the prices are, the most the state spends on subsidies. For comparison, the EU is
estimated to have spent 39 billion euros on fossil fuel subsidies in 2021 alone, according to Climate Scorecard.
That’s the same in yen terms as the Japanese spending.
• Maintaining the subsidies is partly a political move since PM Kishida’s ratings are low at home and he’s not in a

position to upset business lobbies. Still, with fuel prices down significantly from last year, an exit from some of
the subsidies is likely early next year.

Hydrogen economy lags on slow investment and policy decisions: IGES
(Japan NRG, Aug 23)
•  The development of the hydrogen economy lags behind forecasts as investment and policy
decisions remain slow, according to energy experts speaking at the Net-Zero Agenda Through

Regional Cooperation in Green Hydrogen in Asia.
•  The event was hosted by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) in Kanagawa Pref;
speakers included analysts from the IEA, the Asian Development Bank, IGES and Zero Carbon
Hydrogen.
•  The International Energy Agency forecasts that global hydrogen demand in 2030 will double to
200 million tons from around 100 million tons in 2021. Water electrolysis will be the major
production method, requiring 15,000 TWh of power.

•  CONTEXT: There are projects planned for 26 million tons of low-emission hydrogen by 2030, but
only 5% have reached investment decisions. Asian countries are developing hydrogen economies
at varied speeds, and govts need to coordinate to bring down production costs and create
demand, speakers said.
•  The govts also need to accelerate implementation after the plan announcement stage, increase
hydrogen demand, harmonize standards to boost international trades, and build up infrastructure

for long-distance hydrogen transport.
•  Japan must scale up long distance hydrogen transport by building tankers that are 100 times
larger than Suiso Frontier, Japan’s first hydrogen tanker with a capacity to load 1,250 cubic meters
of liquefied hydrogen.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Registration for JPX Carbon Credit Market closes this month

(Japan NRG, Aug 25)
•  Registration for the JPX Carbon Credit Market is due by Aug 31. If the deadline is missed, one can
register and participate gradually after the opening.
•  The schedule is as follows: application deadline, 8/31; ID and password issuance by 9/8;
participant testing from 9/11 to 9/26; checklist submission deadline, 9/27; market opening and
trading start in mid-October
•  CONTEXT: The TSE Carbon Credit Market will allow for trading on the exchange, replacing the
previous methods of negotiated transactions or state-mediated bidding and selling of J-Credits.

The market will feature J-Credits in six categories, each associated with specific applications like
renewable energy and conservation.
• TAKEAWAY: The launch of the carbon credit market is being done in stages. The current state has been given
a fun-sounding name, the GX League, to give it a sense of prestige and coolness. The 500+ companies that
have signed up either to trade carbon credits or be involved in the new market’s developments and rule-
making are described as members of the GX League. The League and the carbon credits market are both
voluntary. Those that join the GX League are also asked to seek GHG reductions of 46% by the end of this

decade (compared with FY2013) to mirror the national CO2 reduction commitments. Emission reduction on
top of that would be rewarded with credits that should be monetized on the exchange.

Japan begins of Fukushima water release; safety maintained but international outcry persists
(Japan NRG, Aug 24)
•  As part of the decommissioning process, Japan began the release of treated water from
Fukushima No. 1 NPP.
•  Initially, about 200-210 metric tons of water were discharged; the daily target is set at 460 tons.

The plant currently holds about 1.3 million tons of treated water, which is hindering
decommissioning.
•  Prior to release, the water underwent treatment to eliminate radionuclides and was mixed with
seawater to dilute it. The main radioactive substance remaining in the water is tritium, which is
almost impossible to remove. The safety of the water was confirmed by the IAEA, which verified
that tritium levels are within acceptable limits.
•  CONTEXT: A financial aid package of ¥80 billion will be put in place to minimize potential harm

and bolster the local fishing sector, which fears repercussions. The objective is to advocate for the
removal of import limitations on Fukushima produce in countries that still have them. China and
South Korea have pointed to safety issues.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite the many months of carefully planning and safety inspections with international bodies
and partners, a number of international media are capitalizing on the public’s uneasy attitude toward this issue.
Many of the headlines around the release have played to people’s natural anxiety about radiation, rather than
lay out the scientific research and context. It is well documented that many nuclear plants around the world,

including in China, the most vocal critic of the release program, release water into tritium levels above that of
Fukushima — without causing damage to marine life.
• No matter the science, the unfortunate fact is that the treated water release in Fukushima is going to cause
damage to Japan’s international reputation. While the treated water release is validated by the IAEA and

Japan’s own nuclear regulator, the NRA, public distrust of TEPCO's management due to the company's past
behavior remains. Japan's allies, such as the U.S. and the EU, have expressed support.

May power sales down; New power market entrants struggle
(Denki Shimbun, Aug 21)
•  According to the EGC, the May volume of power sales was 57,132 GWh, a decrease of 4.2%

YoY,(and a 4.2% decrease from the previous month).
•  New power providers (shin denryoku) saw a 25.5% drop in their volumes to 8,679 GWh, a
consecutive double-digit decrease for eight months. This meant that the market share for the
retailers that entered the business to compete with EPCOs fell to 15.2% in May, down 4.3 points
YoY and down 0.7 points from the previous month.
•  Special high-voltage sales saw a 3.6-point drop to 4.8% (0.2-point drop from the previous month);

Environmental assessment for repowering 36 MW wind station in Aomori Pref

(Government statement, Aug 18)
•  The MoE submitted to METI its comment on “Rokkasho-mura Wind Power Station Replacement
Project Environmental Assessment Report”. This project calls for demolishing the existing wind
power station and replacing it. Japan Wind Development (JWD) is in charge.
•  The MoE summarized its comments: (1) minimize the influence of noise and shadow; (2) prevent
birds from crashing into the wind turbines and not disturbing their migration routes; and (3)
minimize endangering rare plant species.
•  The new station will have a 36 MW capacity (up to ten 3.6 to 4.2 MW turbines) to be built at

Rokkasho-mura in Aomori Pref.
•  CONTEXT: This project dates to August 2020 when the first plan was drafted. After three years,
METI and MoE are still reviewing the environmental assessment reports. Now the govt will ask
JWD to update its plan, with reference to their comments.

Hokkaido tests shows liquefied biomethane can be used for city gas
(Company statement, Aug 22)
•  In July, Hokkaido-based Obihiro Gas and Air Water studied the impact of liquefied biomethane
(LBM) in the city gas supply system and concluded that it could be treated like LNG and could
substitute the fossil fuel.
•  About 5 tons of LBM, which is made from cow manure, was mixed with city gas supplies. This was

the first time a public utility supplied LBM to consumers.
•  Air Water’s LBM output capacity is 360 tons/ year. If 360 tons/ year of LNG were replaced by LBM,
CO2 emissions would drop by 7,740 tons/ year, claims Air Water.
•  CONTEXT: LBM is produced by heat-treating cow manure to generate biogas that consists mainly
of 60% methane and 40% CO2. Air Water uses heat exchangers to remove the CO2 from the gas,
and liquefies it at -160°C. The liquefaction plant is in Obihiro City.
• TAKEAWAY: Air Water claims LBM is “carbon neutral” but fossil energy is likely consumed during transport.

Biogas plants are located in the Taiki Township, which is 50-60 km from the liquefaction plant.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan Gas Association panel to launch biogas life-cycle assessment

(Japan NRG, Aug 22)
o  Japan Gas Association will launch a biogas life-cycle assessment in October to March
2024 ahead of the start of the Clean Gas Certificate system in FY2024.
o  The JGA plans to issue Clean Gas Certificates for synthetic methane (e-methane) and
biogas, and the certificates will be tradeable in the marketplace.
o  CONTEXT: The MoE has guidelines on biogas LCA, but few assessments have been
done. Those that were done related to the environmental impact of the gas in power

generation. The JGA plans to standardize the LCA processes to make it relevant for gas
supply.
• TAKEAWAY: Biogas applications are spreading fast. In February, a group consisting of Mitsui OSK Lines, JERA
and Air Water tested liquefied bio methane (LBM) to sail a ship, substituting LNG with LBM. In October,
Interstellar Technologies plans to launch a rocket propelled solely by LBM, which is made by removing CO2
from biogas generated from livestock manure. The gas is around 60% methane and 40% CO2.

Enhancing Carbon Capture Management:
Japan Selects 7 Sites for CCS Projects

A decade and a half ago, Japan embarked on its first CCS trial in a small northern port
when carbon capture and storage seemed like a distant, highly experimental
technology. Critics may say that little has changed for CCS in that time, but Japan's
top officials disagree.

This year, the government published its first concrete roadmap for the sector, which
gives specific details on when, where and at what cost the technology should be
introduced. There are designs for carbon storage sites at home and abroad, and a
parallel development for a domestic carbon credits marketplace.

The confidence with which Japanese officials have outlined the emergence of CCS as
a new sector that should be operational by 2030 owes a lot to that successful trial
back in 2008. In fact, the same northern Hokkaido port has now been upgraded to an
industry hub to carry the flag for CCS in Japan.

Still, even with broad global support, turning CCS into a commercially viable
technology comes with a number of complications. While CCS has passed its technical
tests in Japan, how it will work as a business has many guessing.


Japan's blueprint for CCS
In early February, ANRE released a final CCS sector roadmap that calls for Japan to
establish the facilities that can store between 6 to 12 million metric tons per annum
(mtpa) of CO2 by 2030. This is equal to the annual emissions generated by two to
three coal-fired power plants.

ANRE assesses the cost of isolating, recovering, transporting, and storing a ton of
CO2 to be about ¥13,000 to ¥20,000. The top of that range is higher than the price at
which a carbon credit for a ton of CO2 trades in most countries. The ETS in the EU, for
example, has only once reached the 100-euro level (¥15,860) since January 2020.
Thus, Japan’s roadmap outlines a target of reducing its initial cost range by 60%
through 2050, mainly by improving the pipeline network.

Overall, the national strategy for CCS development is expected to be focused on six
actions, as outlined by METI in a sector blueprint earlier this year.

• State assistance for firms interested in becoming CCS operators
• Initiatives to lower costs
• Promotion of industry to raise public awareness
• Sector expansion globally, aided by JOGMEC
• Implementation of a ‘’CCS Business Act’’
• Creation and refinement of a sector action strategy

In particular, the government is keen to put in place legislation to govern the new
industry, something that METI has identified as holding back progress in the past.

That’s why it’s working on the CCS Business Act, a draft version of which will face
parliamentary debates in the coming weeks.

The Act should give more clarity on geological regulations and on the handling of oil
and natural gas. There is some uncertainty around whether existing acts that cover
mining and hydrocarbons can or should apply to the CCS business. Furthermore, rules
are needed for the CCS value chain (CO2 separation, capture, transport, storage), as
well as for gas handling and data provision, as well as other aspects.

Another key point in METI’s action plan is how CCS operators should communicate
the sector’s safety issues to local communities.


Corporate response
So far, several domestic consortiums have shown interest in jumping into the carbon
storage businesses. This is partly thanks to METI’s resolution to support a limited
number of CCS projects (around four) through grants and tax breaks (similar to EU and
U.S. practices).

Trading house Itochu announced a collaboration with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
INPEX, and Taisei Corp to study the transport of CO2 by ship for storage within
Japan. Oil refiner Idemitsu Kosan has teamed up with Hokkaido Electric and JAPEX to
explore CCS and CO2 reuse projects in Tomakomai, the port in Hokkaido where
Japan’s CCS industry was born.

Another oil wholesaler, ENEOS, established a research company in partnership with J-
Power and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration to prepare for carbon storage site
selection in western Japan by 2030. The group’s plan involves storing CO2 captured
at ENEOS oil refineries and J-Power electricity stations.

Shipper Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha has signed an MoU with Kansai Electric to assess
marine transport and shipping costs associated with moving liquefied CO2. Kansai
Electric will also work with trading house Mitsui to conduct a feasibility study on a CCS
value chain. While Kansai Electric examines the potential to capture CO2 from its
thermal power plants, Mitsui will focus on strategies to transport and store the
emissions.


Japan's advanced CCS projects
Perhaps the industry’s biggest catalyst, however, came in June when state energy
company JOGMEC announced that it has picked seven sites – five in Japan, two
abroad – for development as part of the first wave of Japanese CCS projects. These
sites are projected to store around 13 mtpa of CO2, of which 30% would be then
exported overseas.

JOGMEC envisages the development of more CCS projects outside Japan that would
allow the storage of 120 to 240 mtpa of CO2 by 2050. According to METI’s
calculations, this scale would require the introduction of up to 24 new injection wells
every year.

The industry hub
Among the first wave of projects, the one in Tomakomai is seen as a flagship and an
epicenter of CCUS technology progress. The port town is host to that first CCS project
that Japan created as a pilot in 2008. The project is run by a JV of domestic
companies called Japan CCS Corp, which started with a geophysical survey that was
commissioned by METI in 2012. Over the course of four years, through 2019, it
successfully captured and stored approximately 0.1 mt of CO2 per year from an
Idemitsu oil refinery.
The CO2 was captured from the off-gas (50% CO2 content) emitted at the refinery
using active amine technology. It was then injected into nearby offshore saline
aquifers and continuously monitored. By late 2019, the project exceeded its target,
capturing a total of 0.3 Mt of CO2. Since then, there’s been no leaks, no local impact
from CO2 injections and no issues with earthquakes in the area.

To build on the pilot’s success, businesses are also considering ways to link the CCS
facilities with other clean energy initiatives in the area. For example, JAPEX and
Deloitte unveiled plans to create a pipeline network that will link the carbon storage
site with manufacturers that need carbon, aiming to foster a carbon-sharing economy.
With plans for green hydrogen production facilities in Hokkaido, the CCS hub of
Tomakomai could also develop as a production center for synthetic fuels that bind
hydrogen and CO2.




















Source: JOGMEC


Conclusion
The realization of the CCS strategy could have a strong impact on Japan’s electricity
mix. Director of ANRE’s CCUS policy, Saeki Norihiko, stated that by 2035 the
domestic CCS framework should serve the power sector as well as big factories in the
cement and chemical industries.

Still, the scale of CCS sector targets also raises questions. Realizing all seven projects
in seven years seems unlikely and there’s scant evidence that an entirely new industry
can be built in such a short time. Another schedule problem may arise when trying to
pair CCS development with that of a national carbon credits market. The latter is set
to be fully operational in 2026, four years ahead of the CCS timeline.

CCS projects will also require significant financing. While all seven of JOGMEC’s
selected projects are due to get fundings from the state, at present only the
Tomakomai development has received funds from another state body – NEDO. New
financing sources, such as the issue of GX Bonds, will be necessary.

Most importantly, the success of domestic projects will play a big role in whether
Japan can later execute its Asia-focused CCS strategy. After all, the small size of the
Japanese sites indicates that the really big capacities will need to be secured
elsewhere.

How to Keep Ammonia Safe: Part II

This is Part II of a two-part series examining the safety issues involved in using
ammonia for power generation. The first story was published in the Aug. 21 Weekly
report.

As several Japanese utilities prepare to start world-first trials of ammonia-fired power
generation, most of the focus will be on the process of producing electricity. But a
major challenge for companies pursuing this technology at gigawatt-scale will be in
how to move and store the ammonia fuel.

Ammonia, a compound that includes hydrogen atoms, is a key component of Japan’s
decarbonization strategy. It is seen as a versatile energy carrier that burns without
emitting CO2, potentially offering another net-zero option to generate electricity.

Japan has already penciled in commercial operations of thermal power plants that
burn coal and ammonia, side by side, from 2027-28. The technology, known as co-
firing because it allows two fuels to be used, is seen as vital for Japan to cut CO2
emissions and wean itself off coal.

The current timescale leaves utilities with just four to five years to solve several
significant logistical and safety standards issues. And among the biggest of these is
creating the right kind of tanks to contain ammonia.




















Source: Canva AI imagining of new ammonia storage tanks

Safety first
Tank safety requirements range from outlining specific levels of earthquake resistance
to temperature and pressure controls. To meet such tough requirements, finding the

20

right tank raw materials is key and a big challenge, according to the Japan Clean Fuel
Ammonia Association. This is because ammonia exposes storage tanks to corrosion
risks.

Tanks require high tensile material that withstands high pressure, low temperatures
and stress corrosion cracks (SCC). Presently, most ammonia tanks in Japan are made
of SLA (low temperature, aluminum-free) carbon steel.

Engineering firms are pursuing alternatives to SLA. They are also studying new tank
shapes in addition to the conventional sphere-shaped structures. Stainless steel
covered by a thin invisible film on the surface, which protects from corrosion, has
emerged as a strong possibility.


Size matters
A power plant installed to co-fire (i.e., use both ammonia and coal as fuel) on a
commercial basis would need to keep tens of thousands of tons of ammonia on site.
That poses a problem, because regulations for large ammonia tanks are yet to be
introduced.

“We cannot build their tanks because safety standards for ammonia tanks of such
sizes are not clear,” an official for Toyo Tanka, a tank manufacturer, told Japan NRG.

Qatar hosts some of the world’s largest tanks for ammonia storage, each of which has
a 50,000-ton capacity. In Japan, tanks of 40,000 tons and above are not permitted.
This will be a serious bottleneck to grow the ammonia energy supply chain as utilities
will need tanks that could hold 100,000 tons of the fuel. A single tank holding 100,000
tons is the ultimate goal. Several small tanks would take up space as each would have
to be situated about 100 meters away from the others.

Engineering major IHI, which has a track record of building 15,000-ton tanks in Japan,
said it discovered that stainless steel of the SUS821L1 specification could potentially
hold up to 110,000 tons of ammonia. The company has also set its sights on ship-
shaped membrane pressurized cargo tanks made from SUS304 stainless steel.

Some have suggested using LNG and LPG tanks, made of carbon steel or aluminum
alloys, for ammonia storage. This would be a major cost saver for the utilities. Stainless
steel, however, appears to be the most popular choice so far.

One industrial tank manufacturer said he believes that some of his customers are
using small stainless steel storage tanks originally designed for other chemicals, but
instead using them to hold ammonia, because they think stainless steel is a stronger
material.


Using the right protection
All metals corrode, including stainless steel. Protective coating on a stainless steel
surface cracks at high temperatures and when exposed to chlorine. Ammonia is stored
at -30 Celsius, but some studies show stainless steel still suffers from slow pitting
corrosion. Aluminum alloy, like stainless steel, has a film on its surface and is
vulnerable to chlorine.

When the coating dissolves and the surface cracks open, copper, nickel and other
elements flow out and react with ammonia, creating new compounds that may impact
the ammonia or the tank surface. Copper compounds in particular may cause
explosions and Japanese regulations ban the use of any copper in ammonia storage
or applications.
The Japan Society of Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers found 3% of
ammonia tanks cracked after three years of usage, possibly due to the tank
manufacturing process used rather than the quality of the metal.
Corrosion also slows the development of ammonia fuel cell batteries, said one gas
utility laboratory researcher. “The cell system may be perfect from the energy
efficiency angle, but the ammonia causes the cell components to degrade fast…this is
the biggest challenge toward cell commercialization,” he said.
Lacking data
Ammonia projects are also deadlocked by a lack of data. For example, all metals
become thinner with time. The metal thickness of tanks needs to factor in abrasion.
However, there are few if any studies that examine how fast stainless steel is worn
away by ammonia. Most corrosion tests cover short periods of time, about 24 hours,
since products are currently designed to keep ammonia only for a short period.
There is no data on how ammonia affects aluminum. There are ammonia-resistant
zinc-plated steel products. These are also for limited ammonia exposures. Views on
the safety of SUS304 are also divided. In general, researchers say more non-partisan
analyses are needed.
Many industrial associations are not big enough to finance research and data
collection, and at the end of the day, they rely on company research. The Japanese
government’s Green Innovation Fund, managed by NEDO, is financing some of the
R&D in this field and is expected to help fill some of the gaps in data. One of the
upcoming pilot projects to co-fire ammonia at a coal power plant is done by power
utility JERA with financing from NEDO.


What happens when coal and ammonia meet?
Another key area to explore will be what happens when ammonia and coal combust,
and what impact this has on boilers, which are usually made from specialty steels.

“There has been analysis on the impact of ammonia gas on machinery components,
but that of the gas generated from the combined combustion of coal and ammonia is
new,” said one laboratory official.

At least compared to tank material safety assessment, the combustion impact analysis
is straightforward. The first step is to identify gases that are released during co-firing
and to build scenarios to forecast their volume. Most boiler components are made of
nickel-based superalloys with strong corrosion resistance, but they are not corrosion-
free.

Metals are sensitive to NOx (nitrogen oxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide,
hydrogen sulfide, and chlorine gases. Ammonia alone releases NO, NO2, and nitrous
oxide (N2O), another type of greenhouse gas. The second step is to draft
maintenance guidelines based on how the gases affect the metals, and identify
required changes to current standards.

One of the gases released from ammonia combustion in particular has caught the
attention of environmentalist activist groups. Ammonia does not emit CO2 when
burned, but it does create NOx, a global warming gas. That said, the chemistry is not
straightforward.

Ammonia has a dual property when it comes to NOx, which it releases when
combusted but also acts as its reduction agent. Chugoku Electric’s 2017 co-firing
demo showed that NOx intensity decreased when the ammonia ratio was increased to
0.8% from 0.6%. Increased understanding of ammonia’s reduction mechanism will
help not only mitigate the gas emissions but also standardize methods to measure
and forecast its environmental impact.

Meanwhile, Chugoku Electric said the temperatures of boiler components were not
affected by ammonia, suggesting that the risk of suspending power generation due to
temperature changes is low.


Rules for worst-case scenarios
ANRE, the agency under METI’s authority that’s responsible for policies on energy
and natural resources, has started to draft version 3 of the sector-relevant Electricity
Business Act Rulebook, which had been upgraded in December last year.

ANRE’s to-do list includes a review of some of the currently unrealistic rules, such as a
320-meter distancing requirement from the most immediate neighboring facilities.
Officials also want more risk assessments and will likely draft guidelines for
emergencies, such as how to manage contact lists and regular staff training.

Once version 3 of the Rulebook is completed, it will be put before the public for
feedback and comments. Going forward, it will be updated often to reflect the
findings of large-scale co-firing tests and to address operational management
approaches.

Meanwhile, the Clean Fuel Ammonia Association is working on its own proposal for
tank standards. It has not elaborated on when the proposal will be released. “Whether
the gas dosage is small or large…it needs to be taken with utmost care,” IHI told
Japan NRG.

Reliable safety codes will not only assure safety and well-being but they’re also
essential for the growth of new industries. Ammonia is a highly hazardous and toxic
chemical, and even the smallest leak can cause serious damage to the environment
and human life.

Development of corrosion-resistant materials and reliable safety codes to clarify the
proper use of materials are some of the essential actions required for the growth of
new ammonia energy solutions ranging from co-firing, transport and fuel cells.

Reliable safety codes will not only assure safety and well-being; they’re also essential
for the growth of new industries. Businesses should not be intimidated by safety risks.
On the other hand, underestimating them can deter innovation. Companies studying
a possible entry into the ammonia fuel cell business often learn about the severity of
corrosion for the first time.

Some consider developing corrosion solutions on their own but give up due to high
business risks. There are ideas for corrosion resistant plating materials or ways to
convert ammonia into something else safer during long-term storage.

For robust research to drive the industry and permeate among its members, correct
safety awareness and codes are needed. Once key safety issues are cleared, Japan
will be ready to develop this into the forecast 50 million tons/ year ammonia market.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ LNG
Woodside Energy reached an in-principle agreement with unions at Australia's largest
LNG project, in the hopes of averting a supply disruption for one of the world's
biggest exporters of the fuel.

Brazil/ Fossil fuels
State-owned Petrobras pledged to maintain a balanced portfolio, continuing to
produce oil for the next four decades, but still boosting investments in renewables.
While the company sees global oil demand dropping in coming decades, it believes
that fossil fuels demand will remain strong.

China/ LNG
China's LNG gas importers are opening or expanding trading desks internationally to
better manage growing supply portfolios in a global market that doubled in value last
year. For example, PCI, a unit of PetroChina, is the country’s largest gas company,
with traders and analysts in Beijing, Singapore, London, Dubai and Houston.

Germany/ LNG
Chemicals group BASF inked a deal to import 800,000 tons of LNG annually from the
U.S., starting 2026 and running through 2043. The seller is Cheniere Energy, the
biggest producer of LNG in the U.S. This is the latest in a string of LNG deals inked by
German companies.
LNG/ Global markets
Global gas prices could rise in the short term if strikes at Australia’s LNG plants take
place, but markets are well balanced now with inventory levels high in North Asia and
Europe, a Shell executive said. Last week, gas prices jumped in Asia and Europe on
concerns that industrial action could disrupt exports from Australia.

Mongolia/ CRMs
The U.S. wants Mongolia to deepen cooperation on mining rare earths and other
minerals. Mongolia and the U.S. will seek “creative ways” to ensure that the country,
which is landlocked by neighbors China and Russia, could get critical minerals onto
the world market.

Sweden/ Battery storage
Northvolt raised €1.2 billion in convertible bonds, including from BlackRock, as
Europe’s biggest battery maker is boosting production to meet EV demand. The debt
issuance comes as the Swedish start-up prepares to raise $5 billion in equity financing
in the next few weeks.

U.S./ LNG
The U.S. will remain the world’s dominant LNG provider over the next four years. By
2027 the country will have 284 million tons of annual LNG liquefaction capacity. In
that period, global liquefaction capacity is expected to rise from the current 487
million tons annually to 958 million tons annually.
