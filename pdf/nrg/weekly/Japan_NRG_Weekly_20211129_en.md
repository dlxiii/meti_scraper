NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Japan to double EV subsidies to be on par with Europe and the U.S.

(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 23)
•  Japan will double the incentive to buy an electric vehicle to ¥ 800,000 (about $7,000), on par with
similar measures in Europe and the U.S., and subsidize charging infrastructure.
•  About ¥37.5 billion ($329 million) for such subsidies are marked in the supplementary budget for
fiscal 2021.
•  The subsidy program also will cover plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles, while other hybrids
remain excluded.
•  CONTEXT: Electric vehicles made up less than 1% of new passenger autos sold in Japan last year.

•  The MoE raised the subsidies to ¥800,000 last fiscal year, but to qualify buyers had to guarantee
that all their electricity would come from renewable sources, a costly and difficult prerequisite.
•  Fuel cell vehicles will be eligible for incentives of up to 2.5 million yen, though the difference in
price from similarly sized gas-fueled cars will factor into the calculation.
•  The government spending will also support the expansion of charging station network to 150,000
by 2030 from about 30,000.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Nissan to make 50% of global car sales electric and hybrid by 2030
(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 25)
o  Automaker to invest 30% more for EVs and plant refurbishment over next decade
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
EV batteries: Cheaper way to recycle material developed in Japan

(Nikkei Shimbun, Nov. 24)
o  Sumitomo Metal Mining will start recycling cobalt, lithium and other key materials from
used electric vehicle batteries, employing a cost-competitive proprietary process to
extract high-grade metals. The company hails the process as the first of its kind.
o  These materials are used in cathodes of lithium-ion batteries, the most common type of
battery in electric vehicles, and global demand for them is only expected to grow.

o  Sumitomo Metal's breakthrough could bolster Japan's domestic supply of these
materials, benefiting the country's EV battery makers.
o  Sumitomo Metal plans to bring a recycling facility online in Japan by 2023. It will have
the capacity to process 7,000 tons of batteries a year -- enough to extract 200 tons of
cobalt, which is sufficient for 20,000 EVs.
• TAKEAWAY: Unlike most other nations, Japan continues to lend support to fuel cell vehicles (FVCs) and
hybrids because they are heavily favored by Toyota Motor. The decision to promote EVs more actively

suggests that Toyota and other domestic auto makers are now much closer to rolling out a range of EV models
and need support in winning over the Japanese market.
• The move also reflects a need for Japan to act more urgently in EVs if its auto industry is to remain competitive

globally. Sales of EVs in Europe, China and in the U.S. are orders of magnitude higher than in Japan. All three
are crucial markets for Toyota, Nissan, Honda and others. While the predicament remains of how to build an
industry eco-system in Japan around the electric engine, there is little time to deliberate.

• Toyota’s concerns about how “clean” Japan’s electricity remains are fair. But stalling on the move to EVs can
only hurt its global position.



METI sets standards for biomass sustainability certification agency

(Japan NRG, Nov. 22)
•  METI plans to require agencies that assess the sustainability of biomass energy projects to obtain
ISO17011 certifications as a proof that they are impartial and have consistent assessment methods.
All three certification agencies – RSPO, RSB and GGL, that conduct the assessment for biomass
power projects in the Feed-in-Tariff system, have cleared the ISO17011 standards. Agricultural
Resource Certification Council, MSPO and ISCC are potential certification bodies currently under

review.
•  Some 28 agricultural resources were proposed as potential biomass fuel resources. In 2018, the
Power Tariff Committee decided edible resources can’t be used as fuel. In 2019, the Committee
determined that coconut, peanut, sunflower seed and other nut shells could be used for biomass
power generation as they were not edible. In order to be integrated into the FIT system, their
lifecycle GHG also needs to be assessed. The lifecycle assessment methodology will basically
follow the EU approach.
•  Decisions have been pending on the use of rice and grain straws, corn straw pellet, sorghum,

unused coconut parts, and 17 other feeds for power generation.
• TAKEAWAY: The biomass fuel definition still creates conflicts with the food supply chain as some potential
energy feeds are used as animal feeds. Almond and walnut shells, which have been approved as fuel, have
been used for livestock feed production. The bigger issue is with rice and grain straws that are used more
extensively in animal feeds. In 2021, the Japanese husbandry sector was hit with straw supply crunch as

supplies from China declined due to COVID manpower shortages.




Japan and Vietnam sign joint corporation plan for 2050 carbon neutrality
(Japan NRG, Nov. 25)
•  Japan’s MoE and Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment will strengthen
cooperation on efforts toward carbon neutrality by 2050, which will include an emission reduction
roadmap applying the Asia Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) adapted by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), enhancing city-to-city collaboration, improving inventory

assessment, monitoring, evaluation and reporting systems, joint development of Joint Credit
Mechanism (JCM) carbon-offset projects, transfer CCUS, hydrogen and carbon recycling
technologies, support development of domestic carbon trades in Vietnam, and others.
•  The countries will organize the second Japan-Vietnam Environment Week on Dec. 14-27 2021,
where businesses will discuss future joint initiatives online.
•  CONTEXT: AIM is different from METI’s energy transition roadmap and analysis. METI’s approach
looks into how different sectors can reduce carbon and finance energy transition strategies. AIM

assesses energy transition scenarios on GHGs. AIM’s analysis includes land usage changes such as
deforestation.

Asahi Kasei plans 2025 debut for giant green hydrogen plant
(Nikkei, Nov. 24)
•  Asahi Kasei plans one of the world’s largest hydrogen plants.
•  To be completed in 2025, the plant will produce hydrogen through the electrolysis of water made

using renewably energy.
•  Asahi Kasei aims to achieve a production cost of ¥330 per kilogram, around one third of current
levels.
•  Japan’s government projects the global market for hydrogen production facilities will be worth
¥4.4 trillion by 2050.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan and Europe lead research into green ammonia
(Nikkei, Nov. 25)
o  Asahi Kasei and JGC Holdings are building a pilot green ammonia plant in Fukushima
that’ll produce several tons of ammonia per day starting 2024.
o  A look at patents for ammonia production technologies shows that many are owned by
Japanese manufacturers and universities.
o  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toyota, the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Nippon

Shokubai rank among the top 10 holders of ammonia related patents filed internationally
between 2003 and 2017.



Tokyo Gas consortium to produce green methane in Malaysia

(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Nov. 26)
•  A consortium comprising Tokyo Gas, Sumitomo Corporation, and state-owned Petronas is making
a feasibility study for a project to produce green methane in Malaysia for transport to Japan.
•  The methane would be synthesized from CO2 and green hydrogen, which would be produced by
the electrolysis of water using renewably generated electricity and shipped to Japan in liquid form.
•  CONTEXT: The process is known as methanation and it can utilize existing LNG and gas
infrastructure. It was covered in detail in the June 7, 2021 edition of Japan NRG.




¥160 billion earmarked for smart city projects
(Sankei News, Nov. 19)
•  The government agreed to allocate ¥146 billion of the 2021/22 supplementary budget on
initiatives to create smart cities.
•  Also, ¥20 billion will go towards developing next generation cellular technologies to replace 5G.
•  ¥50 billion is allocated for submarine cables and other digital infrastructure.
•  ¥90 billion is allocated to quantum key distribution, a cryptographic protocol.

• TAKEAWAY: Smart cities will be one gateway to usher in new and alternative energy technologies, so it is
worth watching their budget. A lot of the transformation that Japan’s energy system requires depends on
going digital with meters, sensors, and digitalization. The data will be used to carve out energy efficiencies and
introduce more complex energy systems that consist of batteries and variable renewables, as well traditional
power generation stations.

• Another line item of note is for submarine cables. The final plan and estimate for a network of underwater
cables to bring offshore wind energy from norther to central Japan is due in spring 2022. Further development
of that plan and its implementation will require funds, and it seems that the government is already preparing
to disperse them.




Kansai Electric joins CO2 transport project

(Nikkei, Nov. 20)
•  Kansai Electric (KEPCO) will join Itochu Corporation, Nippon Steel and others to work on a
feasibility study for transporting liquefied CO2 by ship.
•  KEPCO will capture about 10,000 metric tons of CO2 annually from the emissions of its Maihama
power plant.
•  The CO2 will then be liquefied on-site and shipped to Hokkaido in a specially designed vessel.
•  The study is sponsored by NEDO and will run until 2026/27.




Chuo Electric starts green power service for flat owners with EVs
(Nikkei, Nov. 24)
•  Chuo Electric launched a service to enable EV owners in apartment buildings to charge cars using
renewably generated electricity.
•  Chuo will install charging units in building parking lots.
•  While more homeowners in Tokyo are installing EV charging points, apartment buildings with

charging points are still rare.
•  Demand for EVs is projected to grow in Tokyo in light of a bylaw banning the sale of non-hybrid
petrol vehicles from 2030.



Taiyo Oil starts joint research on biojet fuel production using hydrogen bacteria

(Kankyo Business, Nov. 19)
•  Taiyo Oil said it has signed a joint research agreement with the University of Tokyo's bio-venture
company, UCDI Corp, to produce isobutanol, a raw material for bio-jet fuel.
•  UCDI has developed a special hydrogen bacterium, which grows using H2 as a catalyst and CO2
as an organic component. UCDI also has the technology and patent for producing isobutanol, a
raw material for biofuels, from CO2 using its hydrogen bacteria.
•  The joint research will combine UCDI's fundamental technology with Taiyo Oil's expertise in oil

refining to develop technology for the demonstration of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)
production from hydrogen and carbon dioxide.



Renewables causing serious electricity surpluses
(Nikkei X-Tech, Nov. 22)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  In many countries, electricity surpluses from solar farms and other renewable energy suppliers have
led to investment in storage systems.
•  The U.S. market for such systems quadrupled in 2020, and will triple this year. Nikkei X-Tech
estimates total capacity in the U.S. at 800 kWh.
•  In addition to chemical storage systems such as batteries, gravity-based systems, capacitors,

compressed-air based systems, and even ‘liquid air energy storage’, in which surplus electricity is
used to liquefy air, are all considered as future storage options.

Offshore wind farm tenders likely to be delayed
(Akita Sakigaki Shimpo, Nov. 24)
•  The decision on who will win the first three offshore wind tenders in northern Japan has been
delayed. This concerns the areas known as “promotion zones” for offshore wind power generation.
•  The government initially planned to announce a decision in Oct. or Nov. But interviews with
interested parties around economic benefits have not yet been completed, at least with the Akita

Prefecture governor and authorities.
•  It is widely believed the selection will be delayed until the beginning of 2022.
•  Officially, the government has not clarified if it has started the interview stage. According to one
government officer, the interviews are not in progress at this time.
•  There are multiple bidding parties for each area, so the interview stage may take longer than
expected; the same is true for the evaluation of submitted documents.
•  The national government will pick winners based on a 240-point scale. Of that, 40 points is

allocated for coordination with the local community and economic ripple effects, and the opinions
of local governors will need to be taken into consideration.
•  Akita Prefecture Governor Satake said on Nov. 22 that the prefecture had only just received the
materials prepared by each bidder regarding their planned measures to contribute to the region
and the local economy. As such, the prefectural authorities have not yet had time to examine all
the content and formulate their opinion, he said.
•  METI declined to say whether the offshore wind tender process is delayed.

•  CONTEXT: The three sea areas in question are:
o  Noshiro City, Mitane Town and Oga City
o  Yurihonjo City, north
o  Yurihonjo City, south
•  A further tender is being held for the right to develop offshore wind projects off the coast of Chiba
Prefecture, central Japan.

• TAKEAWAY: Given the high volume of interest in Japan’s first commercial offshore wind power tenders, this
delay is not a surprise. The emphasis on economic benefits to the region is also something that has become
more and more emphasized with the arrival of Prime Minister Kishida. Still, the government cannot afford to let
the tender process slide too much. Both the 2030 power mix targets and the credibility of the offshore wind
industry in Japan depend on this.



Four major power utilities warn about lowering gas stockpiles
(EnergyShift, Nov. 25)


10


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Chugoku Electric, Kyushu Electric, Hokuriku Electric, and Shikoku Electric may soon run out of
LNG. Shortages are due to unusually warm weather and a number of problems at coal-fired power
plants.
•  All the generators are limiting output until Dec. 1 to conserve fuel.
•  Shortages bode ill for winter, forecasted to be Japan’s coldest in a decade.

•  All four power utilities expect demand for electricity to reach over 96% of generation capacity in
February.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Power supply at tightest level in 10 years
(Toyo Keizai, Nov. 27)
o  METI’s projection that electricity demand in TEPCO’s service area in Feb. 2022 will

exceed supply capacity sent shockwaves through the industry.
o  While generators scrambled to boost capacity, they were unable to achieve the 3%
recommended buffer.
o  A few days of unseasonably cold weather or a few power plants going off-line would
force power cuts in February.
o  The phasing out of coal-fired power plants, according to zero-net GHG emissions goals
for 2050, has only made the situation more serious.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Prepare for an energy crisis
(Toyo Keizai, Nov. 19)
o  Japan’s energy market is preparing for a perfect storm caused by global energy
shortages.
o  Energy shortages may result in power cuts or factory shutdowns.

• TAKEAWAY: The narrative on gas stockpiles seems to have shifted very rapidly from Japan’s industry and
officials being quietly confident to ringing the alarm. There seem to be several reasons for this:
• The latest meteorological forecast (See the Weather section) suggests that snow fall will be larger than
expected and central and western region forecast to have colder-than-normal temperatures in the winter

months.
• Japan’s stockpiles are small relative to consumption and with no way to store LNG beyond 2-3 weeks, the
difference between multi-year-high stockpiles and shortages is not so large.

• METI’s urging to utilities that they must top up stockpiles to keep them as high as possible has resulted in the
big companies procuring more cargos at the inflated prices on the spot market. Since utilities are not able to
immediately pass on those higher costs to consumers playing the role of energy security guardian works
against the companies’ financial interests. It is no surprise then that Tohoku Electric and JERA announced last

week that they would stop supplying the wholesale electricity market with power at marginal costs. What’s
more, JERA also said it will stop buying additional spot cargos for winter months after securing 2 million tons
on the spot market.
• Bottom line: The government wants the big power firms to play the role of energy security guarantors, but the

market penalizes them for the same. METI will likely need to adjust the market mechanisms to align national
security incentives with industry needs.

Power grids change JEPX marginal cost formula to fully reflect spot LNG price trends
(Japan NRG, Nov. 24)
•  Tohoku Electric and JERA plan to change the formula for marginal power generation cost used for
spot electricity trades on Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX). This will directly reflect LNG spot

price fluctuations to marginal cost.
•  Previously, the marginal cost reflected weighted average prices of long-term LNG contracts and
spot prices, Tohoku Electric said. By changing the formula, power generation costs incurred from
the use of additional LNG supplies will be adequately reflected in the calculations. Such additional
supplies are secured from the LNG spot market and other means.
•  JERA revised its power supply contracts with Tokyo Electric Energy Partners, effective November,

and will directly trade power supplies for the Tokyo area in the spot JEPX market. Like Tohoku
Electric, in its marginal cost, JERA plans to reflect the cost of sourcing additional LNG supplies
from the spot market and other means.
•  This will be implemented following approval by the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance
Commission.

Major Power Utilities: % of LNG in the power, 2020

Energy Agency fears split in power market between old and new generators
(Denki Shimbun, Nov. 24)
•  The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy seeks ways to enable retailers to more efficiently
procure additional capacity when needed.

•  There are fears that if the renewables market continues to develop independently of traditional
power generators, competition between renewable and traditional producers at times of tight
supply could create inefficiencies in the market as a whole, calling into question the role of the
energy spot market managed by Japan Electric Power eXchange (JEPX).
•  The Agency will hold a series of meetings between representatives of JEPX, the Transmission and
Distribution Grid Council, and OCCTO (the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of

Transmission Operators) to debate the issue, referring to case studies from overseas.



Chubu Electric says renewable energy will make up 20% of its power mix by 2030

•  Chubu Electric announced a goal to increase the share of renewable energy in its power mix to
around 20% by 2030, or 3.2 GW of capacity. That’s only slightly higher than its previous aim for
“about 19%”.
•  Renewables already make up 16% of the mix for the utility based in the central region of Japan.
•  While Chubu Electric acknowledges the trend toward decarbonization, it remains committed to

thermal power even while aiming to half its CO2 emissions by FY2030 (compared to FY2013 level).
•  The company president did say at the presentation of the revised strategy that Chubu Electric
believes that it is “reaching the limit” on developing own power sources and wants to work with
others on future projects.


Tokyo Gas plans small-engine LNG plant to better balance power shortages

(Nikkei, Nov. 25)
•  Tokyo Gas plans a small-scale LNG-fired power station in Chiba.
•  The thermal power station will have dozens of small gas engines that can be started more rapidly.
Batteries of gas engines are also more efficient at partial loads, as the number of engines
operating can be varied as needed.
•  The Jan. 2021 power shortages were a factor in approving this plant.



JERA CEO says Asia’s conditions less suitable for renewable energy

(Toyo Keizai, Nov. 27)
•  JERA's CEO, Onoda Satoshi, says the utility is testing 20/80 ammonia/coal blends at thermal
power stations. If scrubbers can handle higher NOx emissions from ammonia fuel, then blended
fuel will be used in the network.
•  When asked about plans to divest from coal, Onoda said there’s more than one way to ‘climb a
mountain’ (decarbonizing), and noted that Asian nations’ shorter days, milder winds, and less

developed transmission infrastructures make them less suited to renewable energy than Europe.
•  Onoda said thermal plants would remain essential in order to compensate for the variations in
output associated with renewable energy.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Coal not going away says head of Japan’s power utilities group

JERA signals it won’t renew its biggest long-term LNG supply deal with Qatar
(Jiji, Reuters, LNGInfo, Nov. 26)
•  JERA, Japan’s top LNG importer, signaled it won’t renew a long-term LNG supply contract with
Qatargas that involves about 5.5 million tons of the fuel a year. That’s almost 20% of the import

volumes procured each year by the Japanese company.
•  The contract with the Qatargas I LNG facility expires in December 2021.
•  JERA CEO Onoda said he’d like to create a more balanced supply portfolio with greater flexibility,
and that continuing with a large, fixed contract is difficult in today’s more global LNG market that’s
also facing decarbonization pressures and liberalized electricity prices.
•  Onoda added that JERA is not considering any other contracting with Qatar at present. There is a
“mismatch” between what JERA seeks and the terms presented by the Qatari supplier.
•  Current contracts expire after a 25-year term, and pricing is said to be close to oil parity.

•  Onoda concluded that Qatar remains an important gas producer and that JERA is interested in
ammonia and hydrogen projects in the Middle East.
• TAKEAWAY: This may be one of the biggest upheavals in the LNG market in years. It also comes in the same
week that JERA announced it will stop offering electricity on the Japanese wholesale market at marginal prices.
The company will instead sell power at a price that better reflects the cost of fuel. See the Power Section for
more details.

• Almost certainly the sticking point between JERA and Qatar is the so-called destination clause. Qatar insists
that its cargoes be delivered to Japan and not redirected elsewhere. This allows Qatar to control the flow of its
long-term deals with multiple buyers in Asia.

• For buyers, destination clauses are more than an inconvenience. The pandemic and extreme weather events
show that fuel demand can change quickly and dramatically. Japan believes the best way to navigate this is by
building a more fluid and liquid Asia-wide LNG market in which various countries and companies can
exchange / trade cargoes to respond to current needs.

• Japan has walked away from major LNG suppliers in the past over the same issue. Imports from the UAE are
lower in recent years, likely due to the supplier country’s preference for destination clauses in contracts.

• The situation is exacerbated when one considers that JERA is also a major electricity generator and retailer. If
the company can’t have more flexibility in fuel procurement and risk-hedging, it will take losses either at the
fuel stage or during sales of the end-product (electricity).

• Clearly, Japan’s government and JERA prefer to maintain their clout in the LNG market through large-volume
offtake deals. However, this is a gamble that JERA likely has to take. Only a week earlier, JERA agreed to
invest $2.5 billion in the Freeport LNG project in the U.S., which likely offers the Japanese company greater
flexibility on long-term supply.



Oil release likely to have limited benefits
(Nikkei opinion, Nov. 22)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece in Japan’s biggest business daily.
•  Japan cooperated in a release of strategic oil reserves to cool the market.

•  While the government relaxed reserve requirements on private operators in 1991, 2005 and 2011,
it never before released strategic reserves.
•  However, such releases may discourage oil producing nations from increasing supply, thus actually
increasing the price of crude.
•  The yen is also projected to weaken further against the U.S. dollar in coming months, thereby
counteracting any benefits from a crude oil release.

Japan’s First-Ever Release of Strategic Oil Reserves
Blends Inflation Concerns with Geopolitics

In a historic move, Prime Minister Kishida has committed to release 4.2 million barrels
of oil from Japan’s strategic oil reserves as part of a global campaign by major
consumers led by the U.S.

There are several reasons behind the first ever dip into Japanese oil stocks that’s
unconnected to war or a natural disaster. In part, it’s a diplomatic gesture from a
newly appointed premier seeking to curry favor with President Biden while
demarcating the power balance between the PM’s office and METI.

The oil release is also an important signal from Japan’s government that the era of
deflation may be coming to an end; or, at the very least, put on pause.

Two decades of deflation has helped mask a loss of almost a third of the Japanese
consumers’ spending power. In the last decade, that has coincided with an increase in
the basic power bill and surcharges.

With inflation back, Kishida’s government knows that it will find consumers much more
attuned to energy prices, especially as they start to affect food costs. For a country
that relies on imports for over 90% of its primary energy and over 60% of its food, the
fate of the oil price – and its closely related natural gas price – extends to national
security considerations.


Details of the release
The announced tentative releases (barrels of oil) in other countries were as follows:
•  U.S.: 50 million;
•  India: 5 million;
•  China: 7.3 million;
•  South Korea: Up to 5 million;
•  UK: 1.5 million
The total amounts to 70 million barrels, less than one day of global oil consumption.
For Japan, the world’s fifth-largest oil consumer and the fourth-largest crude oil
importer, the size of the release is slightly more significant. The country imports the
equivalent of about 3 million barrels per day (mbpd), though imports were down to
the 2.5 mbpd level and below last year due to Covid.

The oil is expected to be released in a phased manner through March 2022.

METI currently has over 140 days of oil reserves (280 million barrels); the private
sector has 90 days of reserves (170 million barrels); and Japan also has offshore oil
reserves in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. JOGMEC (profiled in the Nov. 15 Japan NRG
edition) typically manages Japan’s oil reserves on behalf of METI and conducts
tenders for releasing national inventories of metals into the domestic market. Details
of the metals tenders are not publicly disclosed.

Japan has occasionally released oil stocks from the private reserves in the past. The
last release was in 2011 during the Libyan civil war, as well as following the Great East
Japan Earthquake earlier that year. The 2011 release by members of the International
Energy Agency (IEA) following the situation in Libya amounted to 60 million barrels
and had limited impact on oil prices.


Contrasting narratives between PM’s Office and METI
A release from the national stockpiles, however, will be a first. But this is something
that METI, the ministry in charge of the oil and gas sector, is loath to do, considering
it potentially damaging to relations with major Middle East oil suppliers and privately
arguing it would be an infringement of the Oil Stockpile Act that stipulates such
releases should be done only in times of emergency.

As a first release from national reserves, METI also warned that the procedures for this
are not yet in place. That means the date of the oil auctions, the exact volumes, and
mechanisms will need to be decided in concert with the actions of other governments.

In contrast, Kishida’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno guaranteed that Japan’s
actions will be compliant with the Stockpile Act and said that the move is vital to
provide price stability during economic recovery from the pandemic.

Matsuno confirmed that via both METI and foreign ministry channels Japan is talking
to several OPEC+ nations to urge an increase of output. He also pointed to the
sectors that the government is particularly keen to support through the oil release:
agriculture and fishery.

While the Chief Cabinet Secretary noted that in case the oil producing countries
retaliate by limiting their currently planned output increases, both he and METI were
keen to also present the oil stockpile release in a more ordinary light.

Every year, Japan refreshes the stocks by selling older oil reserves and bringing in
fresh barrels. This time, the release is simply bringing forward an annual routine
action, a METI official said.













Kishida hopes to get ahead of inflation
While Kishida’s interest in pursuing the oil release helps to improve relations with
President Biden, for whom this exercise has prime domestic importance, and it allows
the new premier to assert control over METI, a ministry that traditionally held the

biggest influence over Japanese energy policy, there are other issues at play.

Prices at the pump in Tokyo have increased for 10 straight months and exceeded
¥170/ liter recently as the country’s state of emergency was lifted and global oil prices
rose to over $80 a barrel.

Inflation is affecting all major economies including the U.S. where CPI now exceeds
6% for the first time in 30 years. But, in Japan, producer price inflation hit a four-
decade high in October driven in part by higher energy costs. In the same month, the
prices that businesses charge each other for services rose to the highest since
November 2001, BoJ data shows.
Source: Bank of Japan
An $80 oil price costs the average Japanese household an extra ¥28,000, while oil at
$90 would push that figure to ¥33,000, according to Yomiuri Shimbun calculations.

The recent trend for a weaker yen will also push up energy costs, and immediately
translate into food costs, which are primarily driven by imports.

Japanese food producers, the farmers and fishermen, would also suffer outsized
damage from rising gasoil prices and yen weakness. The average farming household
income is just ¥1.14 million/ year; for fishing households: ¥1.12 million, both less than
a quarter of the national average. Most are small family businesses and the people
work several jobs.

That’s what makes the agriculture and fisheries sectors key demographics for Kishida

in the fight against inflation. They are also traditionally the biggest supporters of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Kishida has committed his government to creating a new type of inclusive capitalism,
Japan Gasoline Prices (in yen)
which seeks more wealth distribution in addition to economic growth.
A targeted oil stocks release would not cover much of Japan’s total demand, but it
would be significant volumes for the nation’s primary food suppliers. Agriculture and
forestry fuel consumption was close to 149,000 kl (equivalent to about 0.94 million
barrels) in 2019, mainly in the form of kerosene and diesel. For fisheries it was 404,000
kl (about 2.54 million barrels), mainly as bunker fuel.

Should the oil release reach these sensitive and vulnerable industries, Kishida may
Source: Yomiuri Shimbun
consider the measure a success, even if the impact on the oil price is negligible.
Oil market response
Oil prices were almost unchanged after the release announcements. Oil producing countries will meet this
week on Dec. 2, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which are two of Japan’s largest oil suppliers, are thought
to be the only countries that could potentially lift production to reduce oil prices. OPEC+, which includes
Russia, was slated to increase oil production on Dec. 1 by 400,000 bpd as part of an attempt to meet
rising demand. However, the group is said to be considering the cancellation of the output increase.

Since taking office, President Biden has had no contact with Mohammad Bin Salman, the Crown Prince of
Saudi Arabia.
U.S. crude declined almost 7% on Friday, Nov. 6, to a two-month low on news that a new Covid-19
variant, labeled Omicron, was discovered in South Africa.

YURIY HUMBER

Kishida’s Plan for Asia’s Energy Transition: Turn Coal into Hydrogen
During his appearance at the COP26 summit, Prime Minister Kishida vowed that
Japan would take the lead in Asia’s energy transition. His proposal was based on an
obscure $100 million program created earlier this year by his predecessor. It proposes
to help switch the region’s coal power plants to hydrogen, among other measures.

The announcement sheds some light on Kishida’s energy strategy for Asia, hinting at
which technologies will benefit. It also highlighted the new PM’s overall shift in policy
emphasis away from a green economy that’s primarily based on renewables to one
that is “clean”; in other words, an economy based on hydrogen and the CO2 cycle, as
well as renewables.

While that $100 million number seems small for a region that relies so heavily on coal
and where most of the new capacity is planned, during his speech in Glasgow the PM
also gave other, much larger numbers that the nation is willing to make available for
“climate finance” in Asia. Interestingly, at least one of those financial aid pledges
refers to a new climate initiative of which, so far, there is no public record.

With details on the bigger financing numbers few and far between, it is worth looking
at the mission statement of the $100 million program to understand where Japanese
efforts will be directed over the next five to 10 years.


The nuance of Kishida’s comments
As some European delegates called for a total phase out of fossil fuel energy at
COP26, the overall message from Japan’s delegation was that thermal power has a
role to play in a zero-emissions world. Kishida’s speech in Glasgow began by
mentioning the spread of solar power, but concluded that other “clean” sources also
need to be maintained in order to balance out this greater rollout of variable
renewable energy.

“For stable management of frequencies, it is important to make use of legacy thermal
power plants by reducing their emissions to zero…. To transform fossil power plants
to ammonia-hydrogen-driven zero-emissions plants, Japan will develop $100 million
worth of innovative businesses,” Kishida said.

Based on these comments, it seems the money would go to Japanese R&D efforts to
reduce CO2 emissions at thermal plants to zero. In short, the immediate beneficiaries
would be the top machinery firms such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI Corp.

However, when looking at the $100 million program that Kishida referred to, the Asia
Energy Transition Initiative (AETI), a more nuanced picture emerges.


What is the AETI framework?
AETI was announced in May 2021 to support the energy transition in Asian countries.
It specifically targeted countries that form the ASEAN group and offered to:

•  Draw energy transition roadmaps
•  Organize transition financing
•  Provide up to $10 billion of financing to renewables, energy conservation and LNG projects
•  Develop pilot studies around offshore wind, ammonia/ hydrogen combustion and co-firing
•  Share CCUS technologies
•  Train decarbonization experts

What is clear from the above is that AETI is a funnel through which a lot of the bigger
investments by Japanese firms in Asia could be made. It also has the broad reach to
cover technologies from renewables to alternatives (hydrogen) to the CO2 cycle
(carbon capture). AETI does not seek to phase out fossil fuels; for example, it sees
new LNG infrastructure as part of the decarbonization process.

The AETI mission principles fit with METI’s outlook for Asia’s energy transition. The
ministry believes that as the region’s energy demand increases, oil and gas will have
vital roles in supporting economic growth and assuring supply stability. Japanese
officials note that besides the carbon reduction pledges, ASEAN nations are also
committed to reducing the number of their people living in poverty through economic
growth.

As such, METI notes that AETI looks to support transition roadmaps that are diverse
and adapted to each individual country. In practice, this means adopting a stance that
not every nation can tap renewable energy on a large scale. For places like Singapore,
for example, hydrogen and LNG could be more suitable solutions due to the nation’s
position and geography.

Finally, AETI’s mission also states the belief that for energy transitions to succeed, the
solutions need to be affordable. These above principles were confirmed at the first
AETI meeting, dubbed “the Asia Green Growth Partnership Ministerial Meeting” of
energy ministers on October 4.

Countries participating in that first meeting stretched beyond ASEAN and included
Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan,
Kuwait, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Qatar, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka,
Thailand, the UAE, the U.S., and Uzbekistan.

The IEA, and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) also
attended. New Zealand, which has banned upstream oil and gas exploration, did not.


Which companies benefit from AETI
The $100 million number is essentially going to be funding that is made available from
the newly formed ¥2-trillion ($17.4 billion) Green Innovation Fund that’s administered
by NEDO under the aegis of METI.

The financing is supposed to be spent on R&D for technologies that support low-cost
production of either blue or green ammonia, as well as power plant equipment that
can work based on this clean-burning gas.

The period of investments for the Green Innovation Fund is a maximum of 10 years.
This fits with the 2030 timeframe by which METI wants to have ammonia deployed as
a co-firing fuel at thermal power plants.

| The financing is supposed to be spent on R&D for technologies that support low-cost |
| --- |
| production of either blue or green ammonia, as well as power plant equipment tha |
| can work based on this clean-burning gas. |

| The period of investments for the Green Innovation Fund is a maximum of 10 years |
| --- |
| This fits with the 2030 timeframe by which METI wants to have ammonia deployed as |
| a co-firing fuel at thermal power plants. |

Japan’s industry forecasts, however, are more optimistic and suggest that the
transition to ammonia or hydrogen will start within the next five years.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is developing 40 MW turbines that work solely on
ammonia and plans to commercialize the technology by 2025. Its domestic peer IHI
says it currently has small gas turbines that already allows co-firing with 70% ammonia.

MHI also expects within two years to deliver a ship designed to carry multiple gases,
including ammonia. Kawasaki Heavy will test the world’s first hydrogen carrier this
year.

Of course, putting all the new ammonia and hydrogen related technology into
practice at thermal plants around Asia, as well as funding all the other directions that
AETI talks about, will require much more than $100 million.

A joint study by J-Power and Japan Science and Technology Agency puts the cost of
building one 600 MW co-firing power generation unit, based on a 20% ammonia fuel
mix and storage facilities for the gas, at ¥25 billion ($217 million).

ASEAN had 84 GW of installed coal-fired capacity in 2019. The cost of shifting that to
ammonia based on the example above would run to $30 billion.

This is where Kishida’s larger financial promises made at COP26 come in.


Tip of the finding iceberg
During his COP26 address, Kishida said Japan would offer $10 billion over five years
as part of an Innovative Financial Facility for Climate in partnership with the Asia
Development Bank.

At present, there is no online record of such a facility on government websites. In the
original Japanese text of Kishida’s speech, the facility is not even given a specific
name, although it does appear capitalized in the English translation. The Asia
Development Bank also does not mention such a scheme on its website.

Curiously, the AETI initiative also mentions a $10 billion figure, which (as noted above)
is supposed to go towards “financial support for renewable energy, energy efficiency,
LNG and other projects.”

It’s unclear if Kishida was referring to this same $10 billion in his Glasgow speech, but
he did say that the amount would be a top-up to a $60 billion commitment made by
Japan in June. That pledge was made by his predecessor, PM Suga, at the G7 leaders
meeting in Cornwall. It was referred to at the time by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as
a ¥6.5-trillion “assistance to adaptation” program that would last from 2021 to 2025.

The June pledge is also alluded to in a June MoE report, which describes it as borne
from an April U.S.-Japan meeting between Suga and President Biden, and which by
the time of the Cornwall G7 meeting became a commitment to help countries “move
away from unabated coal-fired power generation”, among other issues.

Taken as a whole, the above suggests that a major part of the bigger climate

financing mentioned by Kishida will be directed towards helping Asian nations cut

later a full switch to ammonia/ hydrogen fuel. The investment would cover the cost of
building out hydrogen and ammonia infrastructure in the ASEAN and broader Asia
region.

Of course, Asian projects in carbon capture, storage and recycling projects that relate
to Japanese technology and investments will also likely be supported as yet another
pathway to “clean” thermal power. Japanese trading houses such as Mitsubishi,
Marubeni and others, as well as energy firms such as JERA are large investors in fossil
fuel plants in Asia and would benefit from Kishida’s climate financing.

At $100 million, Japan’s commitment to move Asia away from coal seems small. At
$70.1 billion, however, the numbers start to make more sense.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Renewables
Kallis Energy Investments proposed a 6 GW wind and solar development in South
Australia that would provide electricity to produce green hydrogen for export, with
focus on Japan and South Korea. The project, named Moolawatana Renewable
Hydrogen Project, would cover 1,000 square kilometers; the solar and wind farm
would each have 3 GW capacity.

Australia/ LNG
Woodside Petroleum and BHP Group agreed on a $12 billion plan to develop
Australia’s offshore Scarborough natural gas field and to expand the Pluto LNG plant
to process the fuel. The first cargo is planned for 2026. The deal, which transforms
Woodside into a top 10 global independent oil and gas company, is part of a $40
billion deal whereby Woodside will absorb BHP’s petroleum assets. BHP shareholders
will own 48% of the new entity.

Bill Gates/ Nuclear power
The tech billionaire’s nuclear start-up, TerraPower, will build a second experimental
nuclear reactor together with the U.S. government. The $170 million Idaho-based
project will be 80% funded by the Department of Energy to explore the use of molten
chloride as a coolant. This comes a week after TerraPower announced its first
experimental nuclear reactor, a $4 billion project with 50% funding from Biden’s
infrastructure plan.

Brazil/ Wind power
With 50 MW of new wind capacity coming online, Brazil reached a milestone, hitting
the 20 GW mark of total wind capacity, a 10-fold increase since 2013. Wind is now
Brazil’s third largest source of electricity, with more than 750 wind farms in operation,
which together have more than 10,000 wind turbines. Brazil’s northeast region hosts
about 90% of the country’s total installed capacity.

Denmark/ Cyber security
Wind equipment major Vestas Wind Systems was victim of a cyber security incident,
possibly a ransomware attack. The company didn’t provide details, only saying “that
parts of Vestas’ internal IT infrastructure and data were compromised”. Several IT
systems were shut down as a precaution, but Vestas’ manufacturing, construction and
service teams continued operations.

Italy/ Renewables
Europe’s biggest utility, Enel, will spend up to €210 billion by 2030 to develop green
energy, with such capacity increasing to a total of 129 GW, thus reducing carbon
emissions by 80%. The company plans to be carbon-free by 2040. One of the world’s
largest green energy groups, Enel will exit coal and gas generation by 2027 and 2040,
respectively. It will exit its gas retail business by 2040.

| respectively. It will exit its gas retail business by 2040. |
|  |
| Ireland/ Wind-to-Hydrogen |

Enterprize Energy plans a $10 billion wind farm off Ireland’s coast to power a green
hydrogen production facility. The 4 GW offshore wind farm will supply a 3.2 GW
onshore green hydrogen project. While the offshore farm will be built in deep waters,
Enterprize doesn’t plan floating foundations but instead will use articulated wind
columns that allow turbines to tilt in the waves.

Portugal/ Coal
Portugal shut its last coal plant, becoming the fourth EU country to do so. The
milestone comes nine years ahead of schedule; Portugal originally planned to end
coal by 2030. Belgium, Austria and Sweden are the other three European countries to
have already ended the use of coal for power generation.

Serbia/ Nuclear power
Serbia might scrap a 25-year-old moratorium on nuclear power development as it
seeks to end reliance on coal, which accounts for 68% of its energy mix. Serbia might
buy a stake in an existing regional nuclear power plant, or build its own small modular
nuclear plant. Large nuclear power plants cost over €10 billion, but the country’s
national debt must remain below 60% of GDP.

U.S./ Oil reserves
In a coordinated move with China, Japan, South Korea and the UK, the U.S. ordered
the release of 50 mln barrels of oil — about 2.5 days of total U.S. consumption — to
take place over the coming months. Initially, this effort to drive down oil prices, which
have doubled in the past year, backfired as the Brent crude benchmark rose to $82.3
on the news. However, by the weekend, Brent was trading in the range of $72-$73 a
barrel on news that a new Covid-19 variant was a concern.

U.S./ Fossil fuel divestment
Boston will divest city funds from the fossil fuel industry, joining New York, New
Orleans, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Boston won’t invest in any company that derives
more than 15% of revenue from fossil fuels, which is roughly $65 million of the city's
$2 billion portfolio. There is also a 2025 deadline for full divestment.

UK/ Electricity
Bulb, the UK’s seventh largest heating provider with 1.7 million customers, is
bankrupt, but the government will provide £1.7 billion so that customers continue to
receive electricity and gas through April. Bulb joins 25 other British suppliers that
folded this year, accounting for more than half the country’s market. The rising cost of
gas, combined with price caps on tariffs, means operators now face losses as they
supply energy at below cost.
