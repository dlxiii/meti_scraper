NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


ANRE allocates more funds to energy saving, toughens rules for data center consumption

(Government statement, Jan 10)
•  This fiscal year, Japan will allocate over ¥275 billion, including future obligations for multi-year
commitments, to upgrade energy-saving and non-fossil fuel equipment at industrial and residential
energy systems, especially at SMEs. Demand for subsidies of this kind has been robust, according to
METI.
•  The support will cover installation of AI and other advanced tech to monitor precise energy usage
and dicover ways to reduce losses, as well as money for heat pumps, thermal insulation upgrades,
and high-efficiency homes (ZEH-level).
•  CONTEXT: The spending is part of a three-year, ¥700 billion program started last year to raise energy
efficiency and help smaller businesses to electrify and take steps to decarbonize.
•  Part of this program is an effort to curb rising energy consumption at data centers. It applies to
businesses that utilize 1,500 kl or more of energy per year (oil equivalent) in the process of data
center operations or other kinds of data processing.
•  The Govt wants to impose standards on the larger data centers, including:
o  Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) benchmarks; By FY2030, data center operators must
achieve an average PUE of 1.4 or below, improving energy efficiency indicators by 1%
annually in the medium to long term and submitting periodic reports on long-term plans
and progress.
o  New data centers, including tenant-based centers, should introduce clearly defined
mandatory energy efficiency standards with emphasis on transparency
o  a “pledge & review” system.
o  All operators will be encouraged to disclose certain data voluntarily.
o  The government will monitor and publish information, including naming non-compliant
operators and providing aggregate-level data.
•  One of the stated aims is to to enhance data centers' societal acceptance and drive industry-wide
improvements.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


Concerns over construction costs of transmission line between Hokkaido and Honshu
(Nikkei, Jan 16)
•  Soaring costs to build a transmission line connecting Hokkaido and Honshu, now estimated at ¥1.5
to ¥1.8 trillion, are causing concerns among potential bidders.
•  A consortium led by TEPCO might withdraw from the bidding unless conditions improve. On Jan
15, OCCTO held a hearing to confirm the conditions submitted by the TEPCO-led consortium,
which highlighted uncertainties in feasibility, financial support, and profitability.
•  TEPCO Power Grid vice chief Okamoto said the company can’t commit to the project without
resolving these issues, urging the government for support.
•  Two groups are bidding for the project: the TEPCO consortium and another led by UK-based
Frontier Power. The winner will be chosen by late FY2025.
• TAKEAWAY: This transmission line is one of the key parts of the system that will unlock the development of
offshore wind power around Hokkaido. Like other large infrastructure projects, this one is suffering from rising
EPC costs, a weak yen, and potentially higher financing costs with the Bank of Japan signaling a readiness to
raise interest rates. Govt officials have tried to keep costs under control as much as possible but given the

inflationary pressures, it’s becoming counterproductive. Expect METI to insert flexibility clauses to allow
developers to claw back some cost increases.



Kyushu Electric to offer additional annual wholesale electricity contracts
(Company statement, Jan 14)
•  For FY2025, Kyushu Electric will conduct an additional sale of annual wholesale electricity
contracts, including base and custom-tailored products.

METI cites Groove Energy for failed contributions for renewables promotion
(Government statement, Jan 14)
•  METI disclosed the name of utility Groove Energy, which failed to pay contributions to OCCTO
under the act on special measures concerning procurement of electricity from renewable energy
sources by utilities. Groove Energy failed to pay by the extended deadline of Jan 10.
•  CONTEXT: Article 34, Paragraph 3 of the act mandates that utilities purchase electricity generated by
renewables at pre-determined prices and obligates them to make payments to OCCTO. Groove Energy
was supposed to issue the payment by Jan 6. These payments originate from surcharges collected from
electricity users as part of the cost-sharing mechanism for promoting renewables under Japan’s FIT
system.
•  OCCTO informs the utilities that missed the deadline and specifies a new deadline, after which it
notifies METI of the failed payments. The METI Minister is obligated to publicly announce names of
non-compliant utilities.

NEWS:    HYDROGEN



U.S. hydrogen projects among likely winners in Japan’s CfD auction: Argus
(Japan NRG, Jan 16)
•  U.S. Gulf Coast projects are likely among the winners in Japan’s inaugural Contract for Difference
(CfD) auction to provide subsidies for hydrogen, ammonia and related fuels, Argus analysts said as
part of their Global Hydrogen Outlook 2025 webinar.
•  Japanese firms inked agreements to potentially invest in several Gulf Coast ammonia and hydrogen
projects over the past year or so, and together with U.S. subsidies, these projects should be among
the most competitive, Argus analysts said.

6



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Among the U.S. projects with Japanese partners are ExxonMobil’s Baytown Complex as a
blue ammonia source (JERA, Mitsubishi Corp, Idemitsu); a hydrogen plant by MVCE Gulf Coast
(ENEOS); as well as blue ammonia facilities planned by CF Industries (Mitsui, JERA) and Yara (JERA).
•  Outside of the U.S., other attractive regions might include Australia, Argus said.
•  Last year, green hydrogen costs rose faster than blue hydrogen, widening an already large cost gap
between the two. The gap widened to as much as five times that of the delta between blue and
grey. Still, global investments into capacity based on Final Investment Decisions are evenly split
between blue and green.
• TAKEAWAY: Last year, the U.S. Gulf became the lowest-priced blue ammonia delivery region in the world,
according to S&P Global. Prices dropped to the $470s/ metric ton of blue ammonia in late spring / summer.
The U.S. enjoys the same advantage in blue and green hydrogen, according to Argus. How long the U.S. can
remain at the forefront will depend in part on subsidies in producer countries. Australia is moving towards
establishing an incentive to producers of green hydrogen that would offer $2/ kg for a decade from as soon as
2027. As Australia looks to solidify its position, that of the U.S. is seen in the short-term as more uncertain due
the incoming Trump administration. Meanwhile, production from India, the Middle East, and a couple of other
regions is flying under the radar, but is likely to vie for attention in Japan’s CfD auctions.



Japan-backed eFuel startup Infinium secures more funding

(Company statement, Jan 16)
•  California-based startup Infinium completed the purchase of gas conversion firm Greyrock
Technology alongside the first tranche of its Series C Preferred Stock fundraise, led by Brookfield
Asset Management.
•  New investors include Japan Hydrogen Fund, Mitsubishi Corp, and Japanese state-backed resources
firm JOGMEC, joining major backers like Amazon, SK, and NextEra Energy Resources.
•  The funding will support Infinium's eFuels project pipeline and market expansion; its Pathfinder
facility in North America already supplies ultra-low carbon eFuels to U.S. and European customers.
•  CONTEXT: eFuels are synthetic fuels that can be utilized in existing combustion engines. They aim to
reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by over 90% because eFuels are made with recycled CO2 and clean
hydrogen. Such fuels are already used in the U.S. by firms such as Amazon and American Airlines.
• TAKEAWAY: This seems to be the first publicly announced investment for the $400 million Japan Hydrogen
Fund, which was created last year by mostly private Japanese firms to assist the The Japan Hydrogen
Association developing a supply chain for the hydrogen sector. TotalEnergies was the only initial non-Japanese
investor, joining Toyota Motor, Iwatani, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, MUFG Bank, Tokyo Century, Bank of
Fukuoka, and the MoE-backed state corporation, the Japan Green Investment Corp. for Carbon Neutrality.
Private equity fund Advantage Partners manages the fund. It’s interesting that the Fund’s first money is going
into eFuels – a topic that no doubt delights manufacturers like Toyota Motor that do not believe that all future
transport will be electrified



Nagano Pref advances green and white hydrogen

(Nikkei, Jan 16)
•  A demo plant using artificial photosynthesis developed by Nobel Prize nominee Professor Kazunari
Domen will be built in Nagano's Iida City. It uses sunlight and photocatalysts to produce hydrogen
without CO2 emissions, scaling up from a prior experiment that generated 1,300 liters of hydrogen
daily on a 100 m² system.
•  The new plant, covering 3,000 m² and to be the world's largest, launches in 2026. Hydrogen
produced will fuel buses and other regional applications.
7



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: Nagano (specifically Hakuba Village) is home to Japan’s only confirmed source of natural
hydrogen. Found in the Hakuba Happo Onsen hot springs, this "white hydrogen" is believed to form
continuously underground via rock and geothermal water reactions, offering a potentially ongoing,
low-cost energy resource.

•  CONTEXT: The government has set targets to develop 30-45 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040.
Policies supporting this include designated promotion zones, streamlined permitting processes, and
subsidies to attract investment. Key areas like Akita, Aomori, and Hokkaido are focal points for large-
scale offshore wind projects, leveraging Japan's coastal geography.
• TAKEAWAY: The quality of seabed surveys and other kinds of geotechnical surveys in Japan has been
questioned by some industry players. Rushed and inaccurate surveys were cited as a reason for cost blowouts
for at least one of the Mitsubishi Corp-led offshore wind projects. As Japan’s offshore wind sector adds scale,
however, more specialist firms from Europe and elsewhere are entering the market to offer services. Seafloor
exploration in Japanese waters is a sensitive area due to national security issues. Still, the government may be
keen to support projects like Windpal’s to help reign in costs within the offshore wind sector.

Among Global Uncertainties, Japan Still Sees Key Role for

LNG in Energy Security
Hoping to boost both domestic energy security and cement its role as a leading LNG
trading hub, especially for Southeast Asia, Japan continues to diversify its source of
suppliers across the globe for the super-chilled fuel. The country has also launched its
own strategic LNG reserve to cover any emergency or rapid surge in demand.

Casting a wide net for diversified oil and gas sources has long been a cornerstone of
Japan’s energy policy. In 2024 alone, LNG arrived from 20 countries. This trend of risk-
hedging supply through diversity is expected to continue and is a clear statement that
the government still sees a key role for fossil-fuel generation at home and abroad.
In recent decades, Japan has been one of the world’s leading importers of LNG, and
volumes jumped even further in the wake of the March 2011 Fukushima disaster. When
the nation’s entire fleet of nuclear reactors was idled soon after, LNG (and coal) filled
the gap.

In recent years, however, factors such as economic stagnation, nuclear plant restarts,
market liberalization, and the installation of more renewables capacity have led to a
decline in Japan’s LNG demand.

For key LNG suppliers to Japan – Australia, the Middle East, the U.S. and Russia – the
market remains highly attractive even if today China has become the world’s top
importer. The Japanese government’s recent energy strategy draft assured its support
for the chilled gas as a stable power generation fuel amid an energy transition and
global market turmoil. But does that marry with the strategy of Japanese LNG buyers?
Giving birth to the Strategic Buffer
While Japan today relies on LNG for around 29% of its power generation, overall
demand has been decreasing steadily since 2015, when imports totaled 85 million tons.
Consumption has dropped about 23%, from 88 million tons in 2014 to 68 million tons
in 2022. Despite this decline, the utilization rate of regasification facilities has
increased, rising from 35% in 2020 to 37% in 2021.

In 2021, METI calculated that LNG was the cheapest form of energy in the national
energy mix. However, LNG has since lost this primacy due to added CO2-reduction
related costs. In the latest Basic Energy Plan, the share of LNG in the country’s energy
mix for 2040 isn’t clearly specified (for 2030 it’s forecast at 20%), with overall thermal
power targeted for 40%.
LNG optimists will see this as METI giving the LNG sector carte blanche to eat into
coal’s market share. Skeptics note that the 2030 forecast market share for coal and LNG
is largely unchanged from the 40% “thermal” benchmark for 2040. But either way, with
power demand in Japan also forecast to grow through 2040 thanks to tech demand, a
return to LNG import volume growth is on the cards.

If METI forecasts are accurate, they will reverse a multi-year slump in LNG purchases,
with 2023’s volumes down 8.1% over 2022 to 66.15 million tons.



16



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Hedging the bets
The problem for buyers is that following forecasts that turn out to be wrong is costly,
especially when a single LNG cargo can easily be a couple of hundred million USD.
Overstocking is also not an option from the buyers’ side: LNG can’t be held long in long-
term storage, unlike oil; it evaporates.
Typically, Japan has two power demand peaks - summer and winter. Preparing for the
demand peaks is complicated by the fact that Japan has limited LNG storage capacity of
around 12 billion cubic meters at its 31 LNG receiving terminals – about a month of
consumption. That’s not much, but with buyers keen to avoid being left with excess fuel
on their hands, METI has proposed financial support for securing extra storage tanks in
order to boost storage capacity.

Thus, METI launched the Strategic Buffer in December 2023 to provide a reliable
reserve of LNG in case of emergencies at home and in the region, as well as to cover
peak demand periods. Originally, it entailed at least one LNG cargo (about 70,000
metric tons) available for each month over the winter months.
Under the scheme, Japanese firms ink contracts with LNG suppliers, selling it overseas
or domestically during normal conditions. During crises, METI directs the strategic
reserve to supply domestic firms. A JOGMEC fund covers losses from emergency sales,
while retaining profits (if any).










SBL Framework. Source: JERA, ANRE

Expanding the Strategic Buffer
Even when the idea was first conceived in 2022, the SBL framework was anticipated to
grow from covering only the winter months, to the whole year. In late November 2023,
then METI minister Nishimura announced the approval of JERA’s plan to secure surplus
supply of LNG, while also approving the SBL under the government’s Economic Security
Promotion Act.
JERA, with its 20 LNG carriers and managing around 40 million metric tons of LNG per
year, is Japan’s leading power generator, and became the first company tapped to
manage the SBL cargoes.

In December 2023, Japanese utilities, led by JERA, called for an enlarged SBL. While
fuel inventories were reported to be sufficient (METI reported 2.33 million metric tons
for electric utilities and 2.4 million tons for city gas suppliers), they still claimed that a
bigger SBL was needed to ensure resilience against potential supply disruptions.
In October 2024, the government announced expanding the program fourfold in the
latter half of 2020s, seeking to store at least 840,000 metric tons of LNG a year, to
address both winter and summer demand peaks. The need also stemmed from
uncertainties over nuclear power capacity, as well as reducing dependence on coal and
oil.

Diversifying LNG suppliers
With concerns over energy supply disruptions, Japan is also reshaping its global
partnerships as more supply comes to market, seeking greater diversification of LNG
source by geography, as well as contract terms.
Japan remains highly dependent on far-flung allies for supplies, such as Australia, the
U.S. and Qatar. Unfortunately for Japan, relations are tense with its closest neighbor,
Russia, which supplies just under 10% of the LNG imports. While Russian volumes trail
that of those from allies, transportation costs and time are obviously much smaller due
to proximity of the Sakhalin-2 project to Japan.

Nevertheless, relations with Australia and the U.S. have been clouded by pressure from
those keen to quickly phase out all fossil fuels production, even the volumes slated for
export. Of course, with Donald Trump entering the White House, the American natural
gas spigot promises to flow generously.
As far as Qatar, the relationship continues to be marred by a long-standing
disagreement over “destination clauses” that Qatar insists on, and which prevents
Japanese buyers from reselling the natural gas to regional partners.

The Persian Gulf country has been a reliable supplier of LNG to Japan for decades, also
providing emergency shipments following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Yet,
imports from Qatar fell to 4% in 2022 from 12% in 2021, following the expiry of over 7
million metric tons per year of Qatargas 1 contracts.

At the end of 2024, Qatar held talks in Tokyo with Japanese energy companies
including JERA, Chubu Electric, Kansai Electric, Tohoku Electric, Mitsui, Marubeni, and
shipping firms Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, NYK Line, and "K" Line. Japan's contracts for Qatari
LNG, such as JERA's 700,000 million metric tons per year are set to expire in 2028 and
Kansai Electric's 500,000 million metric tons per year in 2027. Still, cooperation
between the countries continues, for example through Japan's support for Qatar’s North
Field expansion project.

From importer to trader
Even though domestic LNG demand is declining, Japan remains an active international
LNG trader, with state-owned entities like the Japan Bank for International Cooperation
(JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) providing financial support
for LNG supply and trade.

Judging by JOGMEC data, one could argue that Japan’s LNG strategy is more focused
on business expansion outside the country than securing the fuel for domestic use.
While LNG procured for domestic consumption stood at a little over 80 million tons in
2018, by 2023 it had fallen to around 65 million tons. LNG volumes linked to external
trade grew from 14 million tons to 38 million tons in the same time frame as firms like
Kansai Electric, JERA, and others either opened or expanded a Singapore office
dedicated to LNG trading.

Within this context, the SBL can also be considered as a way for the government to take
on the responsibility of prioritizing domestic supplies in case of emergencies on behalf
of the rather overseas-oriented private sector.
Officially, Japan considers LNG as a transition energy source, eventually to be
substituted by ammonia and hydrogen. But the lack of a clear roadmap to phase out
fossil fuel is criticized by environmentalists who question how Japan can meet net zero
emissions goals by 2050 if this ongoing support for LNG purchases continues.

It’s no secret that many top METI bureaucrats still believe that LNG is the most reliable
and cost-effective energy source, and feel indebted to the global LNG community for
coming to Japan’s aid in the aftermath of 2011. For the LNG sector to prosper and
grow, however, it has to take market share from plants that run on coal while keeping
at bay fossil-fuel critics and persuading other Asian nations to embark on coal-to-gas
switching.
One way or another, LNG continues to enjoy ample support in Japan’s public and
private sector, which suggests that its central role in the national energy mix is here to
stay.

Japan Must Tame Wind Power Costs; Data May Use 10% of

All Power by 2030: Yergin
Daniel Yergin is a name synonymous with
energy expertise. A Pulitzer Prize-winning
author and vice chairman of S&P Global,
Yergin has spent decades mapping the
intricate interplay between energy,
geopolitics, and the global economy. His
seminal works, including The Prize and The
New Map, have become essential reading for
policymakers and industry leaders
navigating an era of energy transition and
geopolitical upheaval. With his signature
ability to distill complex dynamics into clear
insights, Yergin has earned a reputation as
one of the foremost voices in energy analysis.
On Jan 13, in Washington DC, Yergin met with a small audience to share his perspectives
on the shifting sands of energy security, the role of renewables in decarbonization, and the
implications of new alliances and rivalries shaping the global energy landscape. He talked
about Japan, Trump, and how Big Tech will determine the future of energy.
Daniel Yergin Q&A at the Atlantic Council in Washington DC on January 13

How has the global energy landscape changed since The Prize was written?
It was striking for me to see what I call the ‘enduring lessons’ of The Prize, and also to
see what it didn’t cover. We can go through the lessons that stand out and the two
things that really were not in the book – one is the importance of energy security, which
is so strong [today]. Secondly, energy is fundamentally now a strategic commodity.
Third, there’s the element of innovation and constant change in technology. And one
more thing, there are hundreds of characters in The Prize, but there are only two
characters that matter – one is called Supply and the other is Demand. You see that
over and over again. I was kind of struck going back and reading about gasoline prices.
The [government] hearings that took place in the 1920s sounded as if they could have
been taking place in the 21st century. There is a failure to recognize that Supply and
Demand, and not machinations, determine market price.
Two big things left out – 1) China. It was striking to me that China hardly appeared in
the book then, at that time China was a tiny oil exporter, sending oil to Japan to pay for
imports in its first stage of industrialization. And though I mentioned that climate was
going to be a big issue, even though I mentioned this, it really doesn't figure
prominently in the book.
As we look ahead, what does the new U.S. leadership need to focus on?
It’s going to be a dramatic change in terms of policy. There’ll be a reversion to the first
Trump administration but in a more thoughtful and experienced way. For all countries
and the IEA it will be a process of rethinking. I am puzzled about Europe - you are
starting to see the shift in the politics and a move toward the right. You are seeing a
“greenlash” against climate policies. And European policy makers will have to think
more about deindustrialization and competitiveness. Climate policies don’t exist in a
vacuum and you have to look at the big picture.

20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

What are your primary advice and counsel to the Trump administration?
Top of the agenda is permitting. On average, globally it takes 20 years to get a mine
going, but in the U.S. it takes 29 years. We need to rationalize the permitting process
and that will be at the top of the agenda to get things done. And that goes for
everything in the energy sector.
As far as LNG – what struck me is the scale of LNG now in the U.S…. The first exports
only began in 2016. This is a very significant new export industry for the U.S. Very
important. U.S. energy exports have been one of the sources to building better
relationships [globally]. This gives the U.S. and any future administrations a strategic
advantage in the global arena.

Trump has an energy dominance goal – how would you advise Trump on the
energy transition?
It’s pretty clear that Trump is going to focus on energy in general, and he’s going to
again withdraw from the Paris Agreement. This will throw climate negotiations into a
period of uncertainty. The Europeans are uncertain what to expect from Trump and his
use of tariffs for a whole host of things.
Competition between the U.S. and China - are there ways to find success on both
sides of the Pacific?
The relationship between the U.S. and China is the great question for the rest of the
21st century. We are more integrated economically than people realize. But there’s also
competition on AI, chips and militarily. There’s competition on critical raw materials; in
2019, this wasn’t even on the agenda. People weren’t thinking about critical raw
materials then. But then people started to look at the amount of minerals needed for
the energy transition. An EV uses 2.5 times more copper than a conventional car, and
then you add those numbers up, and you look at who is doing the mining – there’s a
global competition now for mining. Brazil certainly is oriented towards China with its
exports of raw materials. China is important for Latin American economies in a way that
we [the U.S.], as a country, haven’t focused on.
And these requirements of the energy transition and economic growth will become
more urgent with the new administration. The Chinese have built up formidable
positions, in a concentrated way. There is the issue of ports. The U.S. doesn’t have an
international port company like China does. We are seeing a return to the Great Power
competition.
As far as costs, I’ve heard from a few Asian companies, who said that they can build a
solar panel plant in the U.S. but it will cost them six times as much. One was a Chinese
company and the other Korean. So how do you balance costs? This is not simple.

Does the EU need to rethink the energy transition?
We hear the phrase over and over again that we need “More Ambition”. But there’s a
need to rethink the energy transition for a host of reasons. A lot of the thinking of the
transition congealed during Covid when demand was down, energy prices were down.
And now we’ve had a couple of years of experience. In 2023, wind and solar were at
their highest levels ever, but so were oil and coal, and there’s a message there that
needs to be thought about.
The Prime Minister of Malaysia said that his country will address climate but not
according to what Europe and America told them, because he has to worry about
economic growth and development and poverty issues. I think that the North-South
divide is coming to the fore.



21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Economics of the energy transition – What are your expectations in terms of
driving down the costs of these technologies.
We’ve certainly seen solar costs down 90%; that’s true. Wind costs have come down
substantially, but for Japan trying to do offshore wind, those costs are high. The supply
chain problems have really driven up costs, and we see that in offshore wind in the U.S.,
where the matter is facing rethinking. The supply chain issues for offshore wind are
very significant. Of all the countries it was Japan that’s long been focused on energy
security. Now since the war in Ukraine this issue has become clear to everyone.
How will the surge in demand by AI impact the energy landscape?
Our numbers indicate that within five years, between 7 to 10% of U.S. power demand
could just be coming from data centers. For decades, we've had very slow growth in
energy demand, but now you take data centers, EVs, reshoring of manufacturing, and
now that sharp growth is there, and it is really changing the landscape. Suddenly the
Big Tech companies are big players in the energy sector because they are worried about
reliable energy supplies. They are driving the new interest in nuclear power. Yet, Big
Tech seems divided – those who think renewables can handle the rising demand; while
others look to nuclear, but that’s not coming online until the 2030s; and yet others
think natural gas will do the job, demand for which is surging. I think that natural gas
will meet this demand.
Also, the retirement of existing coal plants will slow down, because reliability is the
most important thing in terms of electricity supply.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This column provides a brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past
week
Australia / Nuclear power
Grace Stanke, Miss America 2023, was hired to bolster public approval of nuclear power
in Australia. Ms Stanke works for Constellation Energy, which operates the largest fleet
of reactors in the U.S. Through public speaking tours and social media, she tries to
make nuclear power more acceptable and addresses concerns about safety.

China / Power transmission
In the first 11 months of 2024, spending on power transmission rose 19% to 529 billion
yuan ($72 billion), said the National Energy Administration. This year, State Grid Corp
of China, the nation’s largest operator, promised to boost spending, as well as China
Southern Power Grid, the other major operator.
China / Solar power
China plans to build a 1 km wide solar power station in space that will beam energy
back to Earth via microwaves. If completed, the new project would be akin to moving
the Three Gorges Dam to a geostationary orbit 36,000 km above the Earth.

India / Power demand
By 2035, one-third of power demand growth is expected to belong to EVs and data
centers, which today account for a negligible share of power demand in India. The
country has a goal of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.

Philippines / Renewable energy
Masdar, the United Arab Emirates state energy giant, inked a $15 billion renewable
energy deal with the Philippines to develop solar, wind and battery energy storage
systems that could total 1 GW of clean power capacity by 2030.
South Korea / Nuclear power
Nuclear power plant operator Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and state utility Korea
Electric Power Corp agreed with Westinghouse to end their intellectual property
dispute.

South Korea / Oil and gas
The country plans to import more U.S. oil and gas to diversify energy sources amid
tensions in the Middle East, the industry minister said. The government may need to
increase support for the purchase of non-Middle East oil, he added.
Taiwan / Solar power
The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that it will reach its 20 GW target of deployed
solar by late 2026. Taiwan's solar power installation capacity currently stands at 14.22
GW, leaving about 6 GW to reach the government's 20 GW target.

Vietnam / Energy policy
Vietnam is revising its National Power Development Plan VII, which will be submitted
to the prime minister for approval by March 1.
