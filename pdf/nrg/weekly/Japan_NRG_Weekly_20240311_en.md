NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Govt proposes to amend Global Warming Act, will foster more renewable promotion zones

(Government statement, March 7)
•  The Kishida Cabinet has approved amendments to the Act on Promotion of Global Warming
Countermeasures, to strengthen the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) system and to foster more
renewable promotion zones.
•  The amendment will clarify the processes that the seven ministers with oversight on JCM need to
take in order to issue credits and manage accounts. A new organization dedicated to credit and
account management will be set up.

•  Currently, only cities, towns and villages are able to set renewable promotion / decarbonization
zones. The amendment will allow prefectural authorities to set the zones when the area covers
multiple municipalities.
•  If passed by the Diet, the proposed effective date of the amendments is April 1, 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: As covered in last week’s NRG report, carbon credit programs like the JCM have proved to be an
effective way to stimulate new clean energy projects by Japanese firms. As tariff-based pricing for renewable
energy is phased out to ease the public’s direct contributions to new green projects, carbon credits-based

solutions are seen as alternative financing mechanisms that also shift the burden more to industry.




METI plans higher rates for bendable solar cells
(Nikkei, March 7)
•  METI plans to set higher Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) rates to power operators using Perovskite solar cells
(PSC) compared to legacy solar panels; it’s hoped that this will incentivize investments in the PSC
market.
•  From FY2025, METI will set the PSC-related FIT purchase rate at over ¥10/kWh. Other details will

be decided in FY2024.
• TAKEAWAY: Due to limited PSC supplies and a lack of objective data on module performance, launching
large-scale commercial PSC services next year would be challenging. METI’s offer does not appear to be a
major boon as the FIT rate for small solar installations (ie. those with a capacity below 10 kW) is set at ¥15/
kWh for 2025. On the other hand, PSC demand from power users in the manufacturing sector is high. They
may import the modules and build their own power supply schemes outside the FIT system.




MoE seeks more protection for biodiversity at wind power sites

(Government statement, March 7)
•  A MoE group tasked with reviewing the environmental impact assessment system for wind power
generation sites has called to strengthen efforts to protect biodiversity and natural resources.

4



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The group’s discussions are held in the framework of the Act on Promotion of
Utilization of Sea Areas for the Development of Marine Renewable Energy Generation Facilities.
• TAKEAWAY: The MoE group was concerned by cases when operator assessments ignored the existence of
rare bird species. This includes a recent MoE opinion on the 465 MW offshore wind farm to be built by a
TEPCO group firm off Kujukuri City, Chiba Pref.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
MoE urges Kujukuri wind farm to protect biodiversity
(Government statement, March 4)
o  The Environment Minister urged TEPCO Renewable Power, which is conducting

assessment work for its 465 MW Kujukuri offshore wind farm (under development), to
include surveys, forecasts, and assessments regarding the impact on local birds.
o  The minister also advised to take additional measures to minimize impact on the habitats
of sea life and seaweed beds during construction.




METI proposes calculation method for DAC
(Government statement, March 3)
•  METI announced plans to establish a calculation method for CO2 capture tech, (such as Direct Air
Capture, or DAC), and then to trade the value of the removed CO2 in J-credits.
•  The policy will distinguish between CO2 removed from the atmosphere after it was created

through the process of burning fossil fuels (i.e. Carbon Capture), and CO2 removal unconnected to
hydrocarbon combustion. “It is important to strictly distinguish the origin of the carbon”, according
to a METI proposal. The ministry plans to define DAC as a process of CO2 removal from "the
atmosphere that is unaffected by fixed emission sources.”
•  Two methods of procuring renewable electricity to power DAC systems were presented: DAC
providers can generate the electricity themselves, or procure it from power producers using non-
fossil certificates or green power certificates.

•  CONTEXT: Experts say the world needs to annually remove as much as 10 billion tons of CO2 from
the atmosphere by 2050. The DAC market is expected to expand, with up to 500,000 tons per year
of DAC projects to launch in the U.S. by 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: In December 2023, ENEOS said it had installed a DAC system by Swiss startup Climeworks for
testing under the “ environment unique to Japan”. It was the first installation of the Swiss maker’s system in
the Asia Pacific and points to a growing interest in DAC among Asian fuel suppliers. Marrying CO2 acquired
through a ‘green’ capture process with recycled methane or other fossil gasses opens up the pathway to

production of synthetic fuels. That’s an industry that METI and others see huge potential for in the next
decade.


ANRE to revamp DR promotion scheme for power and gas retailers

(Government statement, March 7)
•  ANRE will revamp “the energy saving communication ranking system”, aiming to encourage power
and gas retailers to boost energy saving awareness among customers and spread demand
response (DR) programs.

5



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Presently, ANRE rates operators based on their data submitted on a voluntary basis.
•  Retailers will be required to disclose data related to energy saving education initiatives. Examples
include energy saving services such as DR, promotion of energy-efficient equipment, etc.
•  There will be an index to measure the retailers’ energy saving engagements. Details will be
announced later.




Macnica develops sensor powered by perovskite, backed by semi-solid state batteries
(Company statement, March 5)
•  Macnica has developed an air quality sensor prototype powered by perovskite solar cells (PSC) and

semi-solid state batteries as backup. EneCoat Technologies made the PSC modules, while NGK
Insulators made the semi-solid state lithium ion batteries.
•  The sensors measure CO2, temperatures, humidity, particulate matter (PM) and hazardous
substances.
•  CONTEXT: This is the first PSC-embedded appliance unveiled in Japan. The sensor is twice as
large as usual since the PSC needs to be installed in large areas to
provide sufficient power, due to its low power efficiency of 13-

15%.
• TAKEAWAY: The commercialization of the sensor hinges on
when EneCoat will be able to mass produce the modules, and if it
successfully develops PSCs using tin-iodide instead of lead-iodide.
Tin has lower power performance than lead; but lead-containing
PSC might eventually be replaced by lead-free PSC.

iGrid Solutions launches EV quick charging using solar surplus power

(Company statement, March 1)
•  Energy services provider iGrid Solutions is set to launch quick EV charging stations in Tokyo that
will use surplus power from its solar power plants.
•  iGrid owns and operates solar power facilities, mainly on roofs of retail stores and logistics facilities,
at 822 facilities nationwide with a total capacity of about 187 MW. It uses the PPA contract for
many of the facilities and claims that its subsidiary, VPP Japan is among the leaders in onsite PPA

deals in Japan.
•  CONTEXT: In 2021, the firm launched the Surplus Power Circulation Model that specifically aims to
install more solar capacity at a location than is required for on-site consumption. Using AI, the
company then optimizes generation so as to capture surplus volumes and allocate them elsewhere.

•  JAPEX and Invest Alberta signed an MoU to work on energy projects in Canada’s region of
Alberta.
•  The four main focus areas include CCS and CCUS, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage

(BECCS), and blue hydrogen/ammonia.
•  CONTEXT: Alberta accounts for about 80% of the country’s oil production, and has about 40% of
its known oil reserves. Decarbonizing the oil industry is a key goal for Canada’s net-zero ambitions
by 2050.




Power aggregators association forms policy working groups
(ERA statement, March 5)
•  Energy Resource Aggregation Business Association (ERA) has formed five working groups to write
policy proposals on market systems, storage battery systems, low-voltage power resources,
renewables and cybersecurity.

•  Group activities to identify issues and to build solutions will begin in April. Potential topics include
participation in power supply and the demand adjustment market, capacity market, sharing data
from aggregation field studies, etc.
•  ERA was established in October by 87 companies in the aggregation business.




Kubota eyes making own batteries for electric farm equipment
(Nikkei, March 5)
•  The article is based on an interview with Kubota President Kitao Yuichi.
•  Agricultural machinery maker Kubota is considering in-house production of batteries for electric
versions of its farm machinery, to meet demand in Japan, the U.S. and EU.
•  CONTEXT: Kubota makes diesel engines for its farm equipment in Thailand and Japan, and ships

them to the U.S. or Europe for assembly. Kubota plans to commercialize the country's first
unmanned tractors and other farming equipment capable of remote monitoring as early as 2026,
and plans to introduce small and midsize electric tractors, mowers and carriers into the U.S. and EU
markets by 2030.

Japan Rail to introduce power lines that promise no electricity loss in a world-first

(Nikkei, March 9)
•  A research institute that is part of the Japan Railway (JR) group will start delivering electricity this
week on a commercial rail line using a “superconducting power transmission system," a world
first.
•  The technology allows for electricity to be sent across distance without loss by maintaining zero
electrical resistance when cooled. Usually, carrying power over long distances results in a loss of
about 5% of the electricity.
•  The trial will run from March 13 on a section of the Izu Hakone Railway in Shizuoka. A 100-meter-

long superconducting power cable, chillers, pumps, and other equipment will be installed and
operating near Ohito Station on the railroad's Sunzu Line.



IAEA to inspect Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP

(Company statement, March 5)
•  From March 25 to April 2, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will inspect Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa NPP.
•  CONTEXT: In December, the NRA lifted an operational ban on Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, which had
faced problems with anti-terrorism measures. The NPP’s operator, TEPCO, has rectified the matter.
• TAKEAWAY: While TEPCO can restart the NPP, it still needs public support. The IAEA has little oversight

powers over the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa facility, but it can provide a general analysis of the plant’s status. A
positive IAEA evaluation could help persuade the public of TEPCO's ability to run the NPP safely. Likely, the
utility and METI are hoping to win over local government leaders to allow for a restart by mid-summer.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

TEPCO to hold meetings in four towns ahead of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa restart
(Asahi Shimbun, March 4)
o  In early April, TEPCO will hold explanatory meetings for citizens in Niigata, Nagaoka,
Joetsu, and Mitsuke on the restart of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP.
o  Meetings have already been held in Kashiwazaki City and Kariwa Village.




NDF report for Fukushima Daiichi NPP’s melted fuel removal, gas-phase method proposed
(Nikkei, March 7)
•  The Nuclear Damage Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation Corp (NDF) outlined
methods for extracting melted fuel debris from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP.


9



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  They propose the "gas-phase method" that involves water spraying during extraction, and suggest
combining it with solidification before crushing for removal.
•  The gas-phase method is considered practical but it raises concerns about radiation levels.
Another option may be the submergence method that surrounds the reactor building with a
structure and flooding. However, its feasibility remains uncertain.
•  CONTEXT: The trial extraction has been delayed three times already. Since the nuclear accident 13

years ago, no debris has been extracted.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO to start melted fuel extraction by Oct
(Nikkei, March 7)
o  TEPCO aims to extract melted fuel debris from Unit 2 of Fukushima Daiichi NPP by

October, said executive vice president Ono Akira. This process has faced delays due to
challenges in developing the required robotic arm.
o  TEPCO plans to use a fishing rod-like device for extraction, with further plans to use
robotic arms in the late 2020s. Tank dismantling associated with treated water release is
expected to begin around the latter half of FY2024.




KEPCO says production started of fourth batch of MOX fuel in France
(Company statement, March 1)
•  On Feb 29, production started at the Orano Melox plant (France) of the fourth batch (32 units) of
MOX fuel for Units 3 and 4 of KEPCO’s Takahama NPP.
•  KEPCO is sending employees to Orano to ensure quality.
•  CONTEXT: The Orano facility produces MOX fuel derived from a mixture of uranium oxide and

plutonium obtained from spent nuclear fuel. MOX is utilized in some light water reactors for
generating electricity. The MOX produced in the fourth batch will be used from 2026 onwards.
• TAKEAWAY: Since Japan still lacks a domestic nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, sending spent fuel to France is
one small way for KEPCO to try to meet its spent fuel storage goals. However, the amount to be sent to
France equals only about 5% of KEPCO’s overall spent fuel.




OCCTO  says data centers likely to drive electricity demand growth

(Denki Shimbun, March 6)
•  An OCCTO expert panel assessed the electricity supply-demand balance for 2040 to 2050, and
said it sees the expansion of data centers as a lead driver of power demand.
•  The experts examined power demand changes in the structure of industry. They were from:
CRIEPI; Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting; and the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the
Earth (RITE).
•  Their study also showed a significant impact from steel, automobiles, and chemicals production on

the demand side, as well as from semiconductors.



10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CRIEPI assumed that the power increase (at the transmission end) would be between 24 and 198
GWh in 2050; but this will depend on variables such as the processing capacity of data centers and
energy conservation measures by the public.
•  Deloitte Tohmatsu estimated a power demand increase of as much as 96 GWh; while RITE put that
figure at up to 76 GWh.




NTT inks solar PPA with TEPCO to power its Tokyo data center
(Company statement, March 1)
•  NTT Data inked a solar PPA with TEPCO by which three newly built solar farms in Saitama and

Tochigi Prefs will indirectly power NTT’s 40 MW data center in Mitaka City, western Tokyo.
•  The project will begin in August, and the electricity generated will cover 20% of the center’s
demand. It is TEPCO’s first PPA with a data center as customer.
•  CONTEXT: NTT Data Group plans to expand green-related menus for customers. By 2030 it aims
to increase the rate of PPA adoption from the current level of 1-2% to 10%.




NSK develops innovative roller bearings for large wind turbines
(Company statement, Feb 27)
•  NSK has developed upgraded tapered roller bearings for large-scale wind turbines that could help
lower the cost of installation and maintenance of wind power turbines.
•  The bearings are suitable for 15 MW-class turbines used in offshore wind projects.
•  The load capacity has been increased by around 25% compared to conventional products. The

design change enabled a weight reduction of at least 30%.
•  The firm expects to begin mass production in FY2024, and to tap into the Chinese market this
year. NSK estimates sales of the new bearings at ¥4 billion by 2026.
• TAKEAWAY: Wind turbines are increasing in
size. China is pushing the boundaries on
their capacity with a plan by Sany that eyes

30 MW turbines, which are likely to hit
global markets by 2030. The new trend will
stimulate demand for new tech for offshore
wind, providing an opportunity for
component producers like NSK.

Mitsubishi Heavy, Thailand PTT ink 100% ammonia-firing MoU

(Company statement, March 8)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Asia Pacific and Thailand’s PTT Public Company signed an MoU to
develop 100% ammonia firing for gas turbines.
•  They will assess the economical aspect of full ammonia firing, demand for ammonia-fueled power,
and study logistics, safety, building supply chains, etc.
• TAKEAWAY: PTT is an oil and gas firm and power is not its main business. Thailand’s power operators,
Electricity Generating Public Co and BCLP Power, are first testing co-firing rather than jumping into full-

ammonia firing. Japanese power companies are also starting with co-firing since ammonia supplies are not
stable enough, and they want the option to use coal in case of supply disruptions.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

IHI, Sumitomo to study ammonia co-firing with Taiwan Power
(Company statement, March 5)
o  IHI Corp, Sumitomo Corp and Taiwan Power inked an MoU to explore ammonia co-firing

Ammonia, hydrogen’s net zero impact is limited: Kyoto Univ
(University statement, March 5)
•  Kyoto University researchers said a simulation study on hydrogen and ammonia co-firing showed
that the molecules will account for up to 1% of global power supply in 2050 and is unlikely to be a

major climate solution.
•  Coal-fired power will decrease, and an increasing number of power stations will accommodate
hydrogen co-firing.
•  Hydrogen will be used when variable renewable output declines; but it won’t be used extensively
due to its high costs.

ANALYSIS

BY YURIY HUMBER
METI Might Allow Merger of State-backed Oil Firms

For a country famously short of hydrocarbon resources, Japan has a surprising number
of upstream firms. At least 10 sizable players and domestic firms supply around a third
of the nation’s oil and gas. That’s no small feat for the world’s No. 2 LNG importer
and No. 4 oil buyer.

According to a recent media report, however, state officials feel that it may be time
for an industry consolidation. While most of Japan’s exploration & production (E&P)
firms are private, two of the bigger players are state-backed. METI is both the top
shareholder and has oversight over CEO appointments at INPEX Corporation and
Japan Petroleum Exploration Co, better known as JAPEX.

The two companies have enjoyed bumper profit recently thanks to high oil and gas
prices. Net income at INPEX, Japan’s top E&P firm, jumped 97% to a record ¥438
billion in 2022. But over the mid-to-long term, METI officials believe that the costs
associated with hydrocarbons will increase and, along with decarbonization, put a
strain on the companies. Rather than waiting for the hard times, the ministry is
reportedly seeking preemptive action.

Unlike their oil & gas peers in Europe and North America, Japanese upstream firms
have so far faced little overt pressure from activists or the media to decouple from
hydrocarbons. And while both INPEX and JAPEX have announced net-zero 2050
pledges, in line with the national commitment, as well as investments in renewables
and other clean energy areas, the bulk of their business remains focused on oil and
gas.


Corporate background
INPEX Corp is Japan’s only developer and operator of an LNG production facility. The
company spent $40 billion, an industry record at the time, to develop the Ichthys LNG
project in western Australia. The project is due to export 70% of its total production to
Japan over the course of 40 years.

Next, INPEX is hoping to repeat its success in Indonesia, where it helped to discover
the natural deposits that will feed into the $20 billion Abadi LNG project. Operations
there could begin as soon as the end of this decade or in the early 2030s, CEO Ueda
Takayuki said in January. The company owns 65% of the Abadi project, with the
Indonesian government keen to support the development despite its relatively high-
cost basis.

INPEX is also an investor in numerous oil fields around the world, including in Abu
Dhabi. The company even produces natural gas in Japan, at the Minami Nagaoka
field, Niigata Pref.

METI owns about 20% of INPEX and holds a single special class share, which allows
government officials to vet major corporate decisions and top personnel
appointments. CEO Ueda himself is a former METI official, who had reached the rank

of Vice-Minister for International Affairs after a 35-year career at the ministry. Ueda
joined INPEX initially only in 2017, moving quickly through the top ranks before his
appointment as President & CEO in June 2018.

JAPEX also owns about 4.2% of INPEX common shares. In tandem, INPEX owns
5.25% of JAPEX. Meanwhile, METI’s direct ownership in JAPEX is 35.8% with
domestic corporates owners of another 10.1% of the equity.

JAPEX is a much smaller player. Its net assets are now about a tenth that of INPEX
(¥570 billion vs. ¥6.5 trillion). However, in addition to its oil field stakes in Iraq, the UK
and Indonesia, it develops domestic oil and gas fields in the Hokkaido, Akita and
Niigata areas.

JAPEX recently invested heavily in a new LNG terminal and LNG-fired power plant in
the Fukushima Prefecture (Soma), and manages part of the domestic gas supply
network and gas underground storage in the Hokuriku area.


The company is also part of the Japanese consortium invested in Russia’s Sakhalin-1
oil and LNG project, and seeks to become a major Carbon Capture and Storage
player in the domestic and Asian markets, with a number of projects under
development.

Japan’s Upstream Players
Core E&P Players: INPEX, JAPEX, Mitsui Oil Exploration




Producers and refiners: JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration (ENEOS), Idemitsu, Cosmo
Energy











Investors and Traders: Mitsui & Co, Marubeni, Mitsubishi Corp, Sumitomo Corp, and
Itochu














Japan’s upstream needs
Japanese upstream companies are invested in oil and gas fields all around the globe,
from Idemitsu’s involvement in an upstream petroleum business in Norway, to
Cosmo’s E&P efforts in the UAE, to Marubeni’s production projects in India, and
Itochu’s equity stakes in Azeri, Russian, Qatari and Oman projects.

That’s because despite a gradual decrease in domestic demand for fossil fuels due to
energy conservation, a shrinking population, and decarbonization efforts, Japan
remains a major consumer of fossil fuels. Together with a belief in the sanctity of
energy security, METI has continued to promote Japanese investment in overseas oil
and gas fields even after the nation made the net-zero 2050 pledge, noting that
demand for the fossil fuels will continue for many years to come.


In the latest version of the Basic Energy Plan (due to be updated this year), officials
forecast that 31% of the country’s primary energy supplies in 2030 will be sourced
from oil and 18% from natural gas. In addition, the Plan targets 50% of oil and gas
19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

imports to be sourced from Japanese-owned projects, up from the previous goal of
40%. The 2019 ratio was 34.7%.

Put simply, METI officials clearly believe that Japanese energy security is strengthened
when its fuel imports are handled by domestic firms.























And, as the industry moves into a more complex business environment, METI seems
to believe in the need for further industry consolidation.

According to the April issue of Zaiten magazine, METI is moving forward with plans to
engineer an INPEX-JAPEX merger. The magazine, which can be on the sensational
side, claims that much of the rationale for the action is personnel-driven. With many
top government officials keen to finish their career at a plush corporate post (a
practice known as amakudari), the article says that METI vice-ministers want to protect
their future employment opportunities by securing the future of state-backed
upstream firms.

Among the gossip, however, Zaiten relates serious concerns within METI and other
ministries about how INPEX and JAPEX will fare financially once the notoriously
cyclical oil and gas prices decline again. The government’s resource self-sufficiency
targets have encouraged continued investments in oil and gas.

Only last year, Tokyo Gas agreed to spend $2.7 billion on U.S. shale producer Rockliff,
which the Japanese firm said will make it one of the largest shale gas producers in
Texas and Louisiana. It was less than a decade ago that Sumitomo Corporation
booked impairment losses of a similar level after the downturn in commodity prices
convinced the trading house it could not recoup money spent on overseas bets, such
as a shale oil project in the U.S. It took Sumitomo until 2021 to offload the last of its
interests in shale in the U.S. – just as oil prices were starting to nudge upward.

20

JAPEX itself incurred ¥90 billion in losses from an investment in a Canadian oil sands
project when oil prices were low from 2018 to 2021.

Who’s the new boss?
From April, current JAPEX president Fujita Masahiro (a former director-general at
METI’s Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau) is due to move upstairs to be
chairman, passing the baton to career JAPEX employee Yamashita Michiro. The latter
will be the first president in the company’s 69-year history to rise through the
company ranks, rather than be a government appointee. But this is not a sign of METI
loosening control.

At INPEX, from March 26 Chairman Kitamura Toshiaki will move to an advisory role,
leaving his post vacant. According to the company, President Ueda (68) will remain in
his post for the seventh year.

The rationale for keeping the chairman position at INPEX empty, according to Zaiten’s
government sources, is because there are expectations of a merger. Once that is
complete, Ueda will take over as chairman of the joint company.

The new president of the merged entity is expected to be former Agency for Natural
Resources and Energy Commissioner and current METI Assistant Vice-Minister Hosaka
Shin. Incoming JAPEX President Yamashita will be given the Vice Chairman position as
consolation, but it is said to be mainly a title without powers. Current JAPEX Chairman
Watanabe Osamu will be allowed to stay as a director and special advisor to the new
entity.


A merger between INPEX and JAPEX has been discussed in the media for years. Yet it
was resisted especially from the JAPEX side through Tanahashi Yuji, who was JAPEX
chairman and president for 15 years, stepping down only in 2016. A former Vice-
Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tanahashi held great influence within the
bureaucracy but is now 90 and has little sway.

A merger of INPEX with JAPEX will create a substantial Japanese upstream player,
with greater resources and scope, and could be among the top 10-15 global firms in
its field. That should translate into better price leverage domestically, and it might
also help Japan finally embark on the development of domestic offshore hydrocarbon
resources.

Despite all these advantages, how the possible future joint entity will cope in the age
of net-zero is still far from clear and will need to be addressed.

Energy Jobs in Japan: Maximizing Your Value in a Fast Evolving Market
Last month, I touched upon how professionals in the energy space can enhance their
value in the market, regardless of the inherent risk of whether or not their company is
able to secure projects. Some of the key takeaways were:
•  Take on roles that give you a wider exposure, rather than have a focus that’s
too narrow.
•  Gain experience across multiple phases of a project, from early stage

feasibility and due diligence, into bid preparation, later stage development
and execution.
•  If possible, take on multiple work-streams to hedge your risk of being an
asset attached only to a single project.
•  Collect small wins to put on your CV, whether this is signing an MoU with a
business partner, getting investment approval, or developing smaller
projects; real achievements count.

Today, let’s dig deeper into the topic of maximizing your value, both for the purposes
of being recognized as a key asset for internal career development and making
yourself a prime target for external opportunities.

Work widely, or work deeply?
There’s an age-old question of generalization vs specialization. This is a question that
will never go away, and will always have arguments for and against. Let me say that
the correct answer for the purpose of maximizing your value is to do both!

For highly technical and engineering-focused professionals, leaning toward
specializing and working deeply is advisable. In order to effectively lead a key
technical project or engineering package, a high level of technical understanding and
expertise is required, and often we will see professionals who have the right academic
background miss out on job offers because they have not spent enough time honing
their craft and working on real products / projects.

On the other side of this, building some commercial acumen is a value multiplier. The
engineer who can interface with the JV partner or the customer, who looks good in a
suit and can speak with authority, will command much higher value than the genius in
the lab.

As for commercial professionals, skills such as running an RFQ, negotiating a contract,
and managing JV relationships will be more transferable across different segments of
the energy industry. Therefore, a lean toward generalization opens up wider
opportunities and allows you to shift with the market.


Do be mindful that gaining depth of experience and measurable results is key here.
As an example, those who have spent a long time in advisory often struggle to move
to the developer / owner side. Even though they have excellent high-level
understanding, they’ve not had the chance to execute on contracts, manage
relationships through tough times and critically lack the experience in influencing
22

internal stakeholders and gaining approval from all necessary departments, which
often have conflicting interests.

Scale versus complexity
An APAC head of a Fortune 500 company told me years ago when looking at business
leaders: “never confuse scale with complexity - a $10 million business is not
necessarily easier to run than a $500 million business”.

Consider the energy market with its various areas of transition, where many projects
and technologies are still in early stages. Many BESS projects being developed are
under 10 MW; floating offshore wind is at demonstration scale <30 MW; both blue
and green hydrogen production are small-scale and figuring out the logistics; MHC or
ammonia are all still under research.

The challenges in developing and commercializing that first small-scale BESS project,
commissioning that first three-turbine floating wind farm, or shipping liquid hydrogen
safely will not be dissimilar to subsequent projects which are orders of magnitude
larger.

Influence decisions
The difference between the following bullet points on a resume is significant:
•  Analyzed all possible supplier solutions and provided a roadmap and
recommendations to management.
•  Created a solid business case for optimal solution, gained investment

approval and signed binding agreement with supplier.

One main focus in interviews with large, complex organizations is around how the
candidate can manage internal stakeholders and support decision-making. A subject
matter expert, whether internal or an external consultant who does quality work in
analyzing the market, will hit a limit if their interface is only their manager or a single-
point contact in the client organization.

Much more value is gained from presenting and defending a business case, gaining
alignment across all stakeholders, and ultimately getting approval to move forward.
The communication, logical thinking, problem-solving skills that are necessary to make
this happen are all highly valued. This is not the exclusive realm of senior
management either. Even for professionals in their 20s and 30s, getting themselves in
the room and obtaining this experience makes a difference.

Become a global talent
Japan imports roughly 75% of its primary energy; hence professionals in oil and gas
tend to be quite globalized and used to partnering with overseas companies. The
power side, though, has been a more domestic affair until the last decade or so due
to the acceleration of renewables, and now, flexible assets such as energy storage.
Investing in language skills builds a clear advantage for yourself as a professional,
both as Japanese learning English and vice-versa.

Beyond language, gaining experience in markets other than Japan can boost your
longer-term career value. Most multinational companies view APAC as the growth
region to invest in – rather than Japan as a single country market. Hydrogen and

23

ammonia, for example, will not scale with the value chain in Japan alone; it will require
a regional approach.

Renewable power generation investments are also subject to priority shifts from a HQ
perspective depending on policy shifts, geopolitical risks, market economics, etc. By
gaining experience working on projects or markets outside of the home shores of
Japan, you can hedge your risk of potential market exits, and longer term position
yourself as a competitive talent for wider-ranging regional positions.

What can you do now versus what can you do anytime?
Japan can be elitist, and some job changes can be more of a one-way street than in
other countries. The major trading houses are very often someone’s first company,
very seldom someone’s fourth. The move from the developer / owner side to a
consulting / advisory role is relatively easy compared to the move back.

There are exceptions to every rule, of course, and each case is up to the individual
and the stakeholders in the hiring company. As a general rule, however, while you
may gain more valuable experience moving to a smaller or less prestigious firm,
making the move back to top-tier companies later on means greater pressure on you
to perform, gain maximum value, and then communicate it into a clear and
compelling story.

When considering a move, whether as an internal department change, a secondment
to a subsidiary or an external shift, it is important to think about your career value and
potential exit plan at 3.5- and 10-year intervals in the future.


In summary, the energy market is diversifying, and the pace of change is accelerating.
Japanese firms are investing more globally, and Japan is becoming a more attractive
investment destination for foreign capital again.

Putting yourself in a position to ride the waves of change by diversifying your skill set,
banking measurable achievements, investing in skills including languages, and
strategically stacking your skills / experience is the best way to add long-term value to
yourself as a professional.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

Asia / Renewable energy
Renewable energy costs in Asia last year were 13% cheaper than coal and are
expected to be 32% cheaper by 2030, according to a new study by Wood McKenzie.

China / Crude processing
Crude oil processing averaged 14.8 mbpd in 2023, an all-time high. China has
increased refinery capacity more than any other country, partially to meet its
transportation fuel needs but also to produce feedstocks for its petrochemical
industry.

China / Oil and gas
CNOOC has discovered a new reserve in the South China Sea containing over 100
mln tons of oil equivalent. The reserve is located at CNOOC's Kaiping South oilfield in
the Pearl River Delta near Guangdong province, and contains light crude.

China / Green hydrogen
China has 1.2 GW in installed green hydrogen capacity, about half of the global total,
reports the IEA. In 2020 that figure was barely 10%; but rose to 30% in 2022.
Production of green hydrogen is concentrated in inland regions, such as Inner
Mongolia, soon to become a top producer, with a planned annual output of 500,000
tons.

India / Natural gas
India expects companies to invest $5 billion to build natural gas pipeline infrastructure
in the states of Kashmir and Ladakh. By 2030, the govt seeks to raise the share of
natural gas in India's energy mix to 15% from the current 6.2%.

India / Coal power
NTPC officially launched the 1.6 GW stage-1 of Lara Super Thermal Power Station and
began work on stage-II. Investment for each stage is about $1.9 billion. Firms plan to
build at least 10 GW of coal-fired power capacity over the next 10 years. Coal-fired
power plants account for half, or about 215 GW, of India's total installed capacity of
430 GW.

Kazakhstan / Lithium
South Korean researchers have discovered significant lithium reserves in Kazakhstan,
with potential resources worth up to $15.7 billion. This makes the country an
emerging source of the critical metal.

Philippines / LNG
Aboitiz Power and a subsidiary of Manila Electric will invest in the LNG-fired power
plants of a unit of San Miguel Corp – the 1.28 GW Ilijan power plant and a new 1.32
GW facility set to start operating later this year. The investment is about $3.3 billion.

Southeast Asia / Energy transition
The EU said it is committed to mobilizing $11 billion for ASEAN members for
sustainable projects. Also, this past week Australia pledged $2 billion to help finance
the energy transition in the region.

UAE / Nuclear power
Emirates Nuclear Energy Corp launched Unit 4 at the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant
that will account for 25% of the UAE’s electricity. Barakah NPP will have 5.6 GW
capacity when built.
