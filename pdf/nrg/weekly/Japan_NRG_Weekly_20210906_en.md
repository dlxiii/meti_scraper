NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Prime Minister Suga to step down at the end of this month

•  PM Suga was widely expected to seek re-nomination as head of the ruling party, the LDP, at the
leadership race at the end of this month. What remained uncertain was if Suga would engineer to
have the general election before or after the LDP presidential vote.
•  Instead, Suga decided against seeking re-election. This means, from Sept. 29 the country will have
a new prime minister and a new Cabinet. A general election also has to take place within the next
two-three months.
•  Below are some of the early news stories discussing how Suga’s exit will impact energy policy.

Many more will follow over the course of this month, adding an even stronger political flavor to
what has already been a ferocious debate over the country’s energy strategy.
•  Overall, we expect the main tenets of Japan’s decarbonization strategy to remain unchanged in
the short term, irrespective of whoever succeeds Suga.
•  We examine the full situation, Suga’s likely successors, and the various ramifications in the Analysis
section. As part of our deep dive, we also dissect the proposed FY2022 budgets of the various key

ministries and identify what this means for the energy industry over the next 12-18 months.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Continuity of govt. policies in question
(Nikkei Shimbun, Sept. 4)
o  Pursuit of digitalization and decarbonization are two of the key policies of PM Suga’s
administration. Digital Minister Hirai has said the advance of the former will not change.

Details of the latter are less fixed; Suga outlined a vision with his decarbonization targets
for FY2030 and FY2050, but the plan’s implementation is still in the very early stages.
o  The next administration will now be responsible for securing a budget to promote the
wider introduction of renewable energy, especially solar, in the power mix and furthering
regulatory reforms.
o  PM Suga also made the decision to begin the release of treated waste water from
TEPCO's Fukushima Dai-Ichi Nuclear Power Plant site, an issue that has festered for

years. Suga’s government touted the creation of a fund to buy seafood from fishermen
that might be affected by the water release. That water release will not, however, begin
until spring 2023.
o  The challenge of decommissioning and rebuilding Fukushima remains.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
What is the future of Suga’s digital and decarbonization policies?
(Asahi Shimbun, Sept. 3)
o  In PM Suga’s administration, Kono, the Minister of Administrative Reform, and Koizumi,
the Minister of the Environment, are the big proponents of increasing Japan’s renewable

energy reliance. Koizumi has also said that there are others in government who oppose
such a direction.
o  The government will work on the spread of solar power and make efforts in energy
conservation, but it cannot be said that these policies have full govt. support.
o  How Japan meets its international commitments on decarbonization is also yet to be
clearly outlined.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Japan needs competition between power sources and a large portion of renewables in
the electricity mix in order to realize its CO2-free society. However, the future of nuclear
power is still unclear. For now, what to do about building new nuclear plants or replacing
the existing aging assets, as some in the LDP and the big utilities want to do, is an issue
that has been postponed for now.




METI reveals development schedule for “dream” solar technology
(Japan NRG, Aug. 31)
•  METI announced the development schedule for a “dream” solar tech, the perovskite solar cells.
Development is a top priority in the country’s Green Growth Strategy.
•  Perovskite solar cells feature a simpler module structure, which makes them thinner and

lightweight. They comprise iodine and other chemical compounds that are less power-intensive to
produce compared to silicon used for the current solar cells.
•  Japan relies on import of silicon, which is classified as a critical raw material. On the other hand,
Japan is a major supplier of iodine, with an estimated 30% global share.
•  Low raw material cost make perovskite cells a viable alternative to silicon-based units. Technical
challenges include enlarging module size and improving cell endurance.
•  The current government strategy sees Japanese firms starting to produce prototypes in FY2023

and moving to commercialization thanks to the “Zero Emission Homes” program by 2030. The
target cost level is ¥14/ kWh or less.
•  CONTEXT: The government recently announced plans to have 60% of new homes built in 2030
equipped with solar panels.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has the world’s largest solar panel installation density at 147 kW per square kilometer.
Despite the tripling of solar capacity in the last decade, domestic solar panels makers have mostly exited after

losing out to Chinese and Korean competitors. Domestic solar cell production slumped to a record low of
367,142 kW in January 2021, according to the Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association data.
• The development of the next-gen solar cells could be a chance for Japanese firms to reclaim their positions in

the renewable industry. Among firms working on perovskite cells domestically are Ricoh, Nichicon, Samco,
Hoshiden and Kaneka. Ricoh developed the cells for space exploration. However, they’ll need to move fast as
the world’s first production line for perovskite cells already started earlier this year in Poland.




METI outlines offshore wind cost cutting strategy
(Japan NRG, Aug. 31)
•  METI outlined a strategy to bring down the cost of offshore wind power generation to meet its
FY2030 goal of installing 10 GW of offshore wind capacity.
•  Presently Japan has 4 offshore wind facilities with a combined capacity of just 14 MW.
•  The key to cost reduction lies in localizing manufacturing. The country lacks domestic suppliers of

wind turbines, but it has makers of peripherals and devices. METI aims to raise local procurement
rates to 60% of the total project by 2040 by supporting areas of the supply chain where Japanese
firms are already strong. For example: power generation units, carbon fiber blades, magnets and
other related components.

5


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  METI wants local manufacturers to enhance product features while staying competitive on price.
This means that scaling up turbine size isn’t a priority because overseas producers have a clear
lead there.
•  METI noted that Japanese firms have a higher chance of competing in floating wind turbines rather
than fixed-bottom units since the former technology is still under development around the world.

•  Meanwhile, METI will update the national power grid master plan to accommodate the expected
increases in wind power capacity by March 2023.
•  Several ministries, including METI, plan to review enforcement of nine separate laws that touch on
offshore wind in order to help simplify procedures for siting surveys, construction, equipment
installation and removal.
•  METI maintained its aspiration to have offshore wind power costs drop to ¥8-9/ kWh by 2030 for

fixed bottom turbines.
SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Green Innovation Fund to allocate ¥120 billion to make wind power cheaper
(Nikkei, Aug. 31)
o  METI will allocate up to ¥120 billion of its ¥2 trillion fund to develop carbon neutral
technologies to reduce the costs of offshore wind development.



U.S. climate envoy Kerry visits Tokyo, prods Japan over LNG support

(Asia Nikkei, Sept. 1)
•  U.S. Climate envoy John Kerry visited Japan and met top officials including PM Suga to promote
climate response measures as one of the key pillars of the U.S.-Japan relationship.
•  Kerry criticized Japan for supporting the development of LNG use in southeast Asia and urged the
country to switch its support to renewables in the region.
•  Japan and the U.S. will work together on exporting renewable energy and decarbonization
infrastructure as part of their climate partnership.
• TAKEAWAY: A few days after Kerry met with PM Suga, the latter said he’ll resign. However, the agenda Kerry

is promoting will pass to Suga’s successor. Some in the Cabinet, such as MoE Minister Koizumi, fully support
Kerry’s comments. Others, such as METI Minister Kajiyama, are less confident that throwing all of Japan’s
weight behind renewables in Asia (and at home) is the right strategy. Japan will surely support most initiatives
the U.S. wants to unveil at COP26, but it’s unlikely to back down from its promotion of LNG any time soon.
Moreover, a lot of the new LNG capacity coming to market is from North America, so Kerry’s position may not
also be one widely shared in the U.S.

• However, fuel price is a more realistic deterrent for Southeast Asian countries to invest in LNG infrastructure
and gas-fired power plants. Last week Bangladesh said it won’t buy more spot LNG cargos this year due to
price hikes in the last six months.



Environment Ministry seeks hydrogen projects for JCM

(Japan NRG, Aug. 31)
•  The MoE is soliciting applications for hydrogen projects seeking to be registered in the Joint
Credit Mechanism (JCM). The projects would involve manufacturing hydrogen overseas for use in
Japan.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Hydrogen needs to be produced using renewable energy. Candidate projects should cover
transport of hydrogen to Japan. Applications will be accepted until Sept. 30.



Russia and Japan agree to jointly produce hydrogen and ammonia

(Reuters, Nikkei Sept. 2)
•  Japan and Russia signed an agreement to work together on hydrogen and ammonia production
during the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia.
•  The agreement is part of Japan’s strategy to diversify the potential supply of hydrogen and other
energy resources.
•  The two countries agreed to cooperate in hydrogen R&D, as well as on development carbon

capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCUS). Japan will set up a new
working group that will lead the discussions.
•  METI also signed an MoU with Russia's largest LNG producer Novatek to work jointly on hydrogen,
ammonia, CCS and CCUS.
•  A similar accord might be signed with another Russia energy firm later this month.
•  CONTEXT: Russia accounted for about 10% of global ammonia production in 2020.




Hitachi Zosen is changing the way we think about CO2
(Nikkei, Aug. 31)
•  Hitachi Zosen began converting waste CO2 to methane, for use as fuel.
•  In 2022, Hitachi Zosen will begin commercial-scale operations with the construction of a
methanation plant next to a garbage furnace on its Kanagawa site. CO2 released by burning waste

will be converted to methane, which can be used as a synthetic form of natural gas.
•  The technology is the result of collaboration with Tohoku University and other institutions since the
1990s to develop a catalytic process that allows methanation at relatively low temperatures,
around 200°C.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Asahi Group Holdings trials methanation technology

(New Energy Business News, Sept. 2)
o  A subsidiary of Asahi Group Holdings installed an experimental methanation system at its
Ibaraki research center, making it the first Japanese food and beverage company to do
so.
o  The system was supplied by IHI.
o  Asahi will subject the system to 10,000 continuous hours of operation to assess cost
performance and methane quality.

Group led by Toray and TEPCO wins funding for power-to-gas hydrogen

(New Energy Busines News, Sept. 3)
•  A group of companies won funding from state-backed research body NEDO for a hydrogen and
power-to-gas project in Yamanashi project.
•  The Yamanashi Hydrogen Energy Society (H2-YES) project plans to produce hydrogen utilizing a
modular renewable energy system and offer the fuel to local factories, eliminating the need for
transportation. The size of the modular power-to-gas (P2G) system will reach 16 MW.
•  NEDO will offer subsidies to build and test the business model until FY2025. This project is one of

the pillars of the national strategy to cut the cost of electrolyzer to ¥65,000/ kW.
•  The project consortium includes: TEPCO, which will install the P2G systems and hydrogen boilers
for consumers; Toray, which will develop electrolyte membranes; Hitachi Zosen and Siemens
Energy, which will increase the size of the electrolyzers; Kaji Tech, which will develop hydrogen
compressors; Miura Co., which will develop hydrogen-fueled steam boilers; and Nichicon to
develop power converters that are optimal for electrolyzers.

Government forecasts that Tokyo will be under power constraints until Q1 2023
(Japan NRG, Aug. 27)
•  Power supply in the Tokyo area will remain very tight until the first quarter of 2023, according to
the near-term electricity supply demand outlook published by METI.
•  If the region serviced by TEPCO were to experience a once in 10-year cold snap this coming
winter, the electricity supply would fall 2.1% short of demand in January 2022 and 2.4% short in

February, METI said.
•  In February 2021, the TEPCO service area experienced a 0.3% shortfall in electricity supply.
•  Thanks to the restarts of large thermal and nuclear plants, supply reserve rates are seen improving
slightly in July 2022 and January-February 2023, but depending on the weather conditions,
demand may outstrip supply notably in the winter months.
•  The tightness is expected to ease slightly when new capacities of around 2.5 GW go online even
as 1-2 GW go offline in east Japan in the summer of 2023.
•  METI said that shuttering old plants may speed up with the launch of the power capacity market in

2024.

•  High temperature gas reactors are considered a ‘secret weapon’ in the mission to reduce carbon
emissions.

•  An application to restart the reactor, which was shut down after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, was
filed in 2014. It wasn’t until this year that work to implement a raft of safety enhancements
demanded by the regulator, such as installing systems to protect cables from high temperatures
during a fire, was finally completed.
•  Instead of water, high temperature gas reactors are cooled by helium gas, which is then used to

drive a turbine. These reactors are said to be inherently safe due to their ability to automatically
shut down in the event of a burst pipe or other accidents.
•  The high temperatures of nearly 1000° elicited by these reactors are also useful for separating
water into hydrogen and oxygen, a process that requires less energy than electrolysis.




Chugoku Electric outlines compliance plan after shredding years of data

Japan’s Change in Prime Minister Unlikely to Affect Energy Policy in
the Short-Term;

Government Budget Requests Give Better Hints at the Focus

On Friday, Sept. 3, Prime Minister Suga announced that he will resign his post when
his term as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president expires at the end of the month.
Suga’s resignation will not alter energy policy and the focus on decarbonization, at
least over the next few months. After that, Japan’s path to a lower carbon economy
may change considerably depending on who succeeds Suga.

At present, the top candidates to take over as leader include Kono Taro, currently in
charge of the vaccination program and administrative reforms, and former Foreign
Minister Kishida Fumio. Ongoing intraparty politicking suggests they will be joined by
others prior to the Sept. 17 start of the leadership race. The LDP presidential election
will be held on Sept. 29, and is to be followed by a general election between Oct. 17
and Nov. 28.

Kono is a strong advocate of renewables, market-based solutions and a nuclear
energy skeptic. Kishida is likely to stick to the traditional LDP support for large-scale
infrastructure solutions such as CCUS and co-firing at thermal plants, and favors
retaining a strong nuclear sector while gradually increasing the share of renewables.
Thus, both support a shift to clean energy, though their policy preferences imply
differences in weight given to renewables in addition to the relative roles of other
decarbonization technologies.

In the short run, attention will focus on the fate of the recently drafted and quite
contentious 6th Basic Energy Plan. The Plan was expected to be ratified by the Cabinet
in mid-October, ahead of the COP26 climate meeting on Nov. 1 in Glasgow. A new
Cabinet may well push back decisions on the Plan until after the general election, to
minimize the risk of alienating any voting block during the campaign.

It’s too early to guess how a new – and presumably LDP - prime minister might
influence the energy mix after the national vote. But a practical guide to Japan’s
energy priorities over the next year can be found via dissecting individual ministry and
agency requests for the fiscal year 2022 general budget. In late August, Japan’s
various ministries and agencies submitted their funding requests for next year, and
these documents reveal key themes and projects.

The total sought by all Japanese government entities for the fiscal year beginning
April 2022 is around ¥111 trillion, up ¥6 trillion on the previous year. That amount
does not include all the spending ministries say they require to combat the Covid-19
pandemic.

| Government Budget Requests Give Better Hints at the Focus |

During the autumn months, as electoral politics play out, the ministries’ draft budgets
will be negotiated with the powerful Ministry of Finance. Given Japan’s ¥1.2
quadrillion in public debt (over 250% of GDP), MoF’s conservative stance is certainly
warranted. Yet the purse strings may well be loosened this year ahead of the general
election – especially in areas related to decarbonization and digital transformation.
These are the core directions set out by Suga, and are unlikely to change under his
successors. Together with social spending and local revitalization, these four goals
make up the bulk of the proposed budget.

Based on the various ministries’ requests, the areas that look set to receive the most
support include renewable energy, electric vehicles (EV), hydrogen and 5G
infrastructure.

No matter who becomes prime minister, Japan will need to present evidence of major
movement in green tech at the COP26 meeting. That imperative suggests that the
MoF Budget Bureau’s bean-counters – led by a fiscal hawk - may restrain their red
pens in assessing the double-digit increases in energy-related budget requests.

Below are the standout energy-related budget requests.

ANALYSIS

Japan’s Self-Defense Forces See the Emergence of a New Front:
The War on Climate Destruction

In just one year, the Japanese state’s biggest emitter morphed into its most
progressive clean power buyer. And more dramatic developments are yet to come.

Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (SDF) are best known for their prowess in dealing with
natural disasters rather than for military exploits. This experience has given the SDF a
unique and hands-on understanding of climate change’s impact on national security.

For the first time the SDF has framed its concerns as a national security issue, joining
an array of militaries from around the world in publicly discussing climate challenges.

The SDF also published results of its initial efforts to switch energy supplies to
renewable sources. The results are impressive.



From petals to samurai
The publication of this year’s “Defense White Paper” by the
Defense Ministry caught people’s attention. Gone were the usual
placid tones and pink Sakura petals on the cover, which instead
featured an ink painting of a mounted samurai.

The art and the more candid discussion of geopolitics were not
the only thing new. Seemingly for the first time, the Defense
Ministry identified climate change as a national security danger
and devoted an entire section to the problems the country faces.

“The lack of water, food and land, resulting from complex impacts
of climate change, may not only trigger and worsen conflicts over limited land and
resources, but also lead to massive migrations, and cause social and political tensions
and conflicts,” expounded the report.

It added that the occurrence of extreme weather events, such as heavy rains and
floods, and more powerful typhoons, already pose a challenge to troops and could
grow worse. The time required for rescue operations is longer. Meanwhile, the risk of
conflicts and tensions triggered by such weather events is rising.

Similar sentiments have come from military and administrations elsewhere. U.S.
President Joe Biden, upon taking office earlier this year, ordered the Secretary of
Defense to consider the security implications of climate change in developing the
National Defense Strategy, Defense Planning Guidance, and Chairman’s Risk
Assessment.

In June, NATO issued a “Climate Change and Security Action Plan.” Calling climate
change a “threat multiplier that impacts Allied security,” NATO said it will conduct an

annual assessment to analyze the impact of climate change on the strategic
environment and its assets, installations, missions and operations.

In Japan, national disasters often require troops to be sent in for disaster relief, so the
SDF’s views on climate change are more than just the acknowledgement of a global
issue.

Defense Minister Kishi Nobuo calls climate change a “spiral risk,” that creates a
spillover from one country to another, threatening global peace and stability. In his
speech at the Leaders’ Summit on Climate organized by the U.S. government in April,
Kishi said climate change increases natural disasters such as floods and droughts,
making the environment more difficult to live in and fostering conditions for crime and
extremism to flourish. This will provoke more conflicts over territory and natural
resources, he said.

Kishi pointed out three ways climate change can affect Japan’s security;

•  Weaken capacity of the SDF due to the increase of climate change-induced natural disasters
More frequent torrential rains have led to an increase in troops deployed and the length of
operations, affecting the readiness for national defense missions. The total number of troops
involved in disaster relief topped 1 million (close to 1% of Japan’s population) for both 2018 and
2019, and reserves have to be called up for relief operations.

•  Raise sea levels
Land loss from the encroaching sea will intensify struggle over territory and natural resources, and
trigger mass migrations, threatening to cause region-wide destabilization.

•  Melt Arctic Sea ice
The melting of the Arctic Sea ice has increased the region’s strategic importance because of the
potential for resources like oil and gas beneath the seabed and a shorter sea route from Japan to
Europe.

Kishi also launched a task force on climate change. The first meeting comprised senior
ministry officials and was held in May to analyze the impact of climate change on
national security and to prepare measures. They talked about adopting cutting edge
green technology and cooperating with allies, as well as the sourcing of renewable
energy across the ministry.

The defense ministry’s decisions have a significant impact on the government’s overall
emission footprint because it’s the largest power consumer, accounting for about 40%
of all electricity used by Japan’s ministries and agencies.

The idea of increasing renewable electricity use by the ministry and the SDF was first
floated by Kono Taro, then defense minister, in December 2019. Kono, now one of
the candidates to become the next Japanese prime minister, said the defense ministry
and the SDF will aim to:

•  Significantly raise the share of clean energy and increase renewable’s share to 100% where
possible
•  Source electricity from local power providers near SDF’s facilities
•  Ensure fair competitions
•  Keep costs down

21


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Ensure power supply is stable

Kono said this will start as a trial to see how much clean energy can be added without
adding more procurement cost and causing disruptions to power supply. He also
stressed the benefit of using domestically produced energy. Resource-poor Japan’s
self-sufficiency ratio of energy is 11.8 %, far below other OECD member countries.


The results
The policy has had immediate impact on the ministry’s roughly 1,000 power
procurement contracts. For the fiscal year that ended in March 2021, 151 defense
facilities signed renewable power contracts for 91 GWh of electricity, an equivalent of
that used by 20,000 homes. Among the suppliers was Hamamatsu Energy, a small,
regional clean energy provider owned by the city of Hamamatsu, a subsidiary of NTT,
and local financial institutions and others.

This fiscal year, the number of military buildings using renewables rose by more than
three times to 526, including 282 facilities that use only renewable energy such as
Camp Higashi-Chitose in Hokkaido and Kanoya Air Base in Kagoshima. Estimated
power consumption across the ministry and SDF facilities also rose nearly seven-fold
to 620 GWh on year, equal to nearly half of the total estimated power consumption by
the ministry and SDF.

Increasing the share of renewable electricity won’t be easy, partly due to the arduous
sourcing process. It starts with research on the availability of renewable energy
providers in the vicinity of each military facility. An auction will then be held if there
are more than two providers of 100% renewable energy. If the first round fails to find a
winner due to high costs, the second and third rounds will be held with providers of
50% renewable energy and 30% clean power, respectively. If still no winner, a fourth
and last round will be held with non-renewable electricity suppliers.

Although nearly 60% of the Air Self-Defense Force’s facilities are using renewable
power, further expansions may be difficult because some regions have no suppliers of
solar, wind, geothermal, biomass or small hydro.

Despite these obstacles and challenges, the SDF’s mobilization and willingness to join
the war against climate change is a huge boost to the common global cause, and will
certainly prod and inspire other militaries in the Asia-Pacific region to follow suit.
Militaries now have a new enemy, and hopefully this common threat will act as a
unifying factor even among countries that have traditionally been hostile to each
other.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Carbon-emissions markets
The value of the world’s carbon markets grew 23% last year to about $281 billion,
Refinitiv reported. These markets could be worth as much as $22 trillion by 2050,
Wood Mackenzie estimates. As governments around the world push to expand in this
area, Vitol, Glencore and others that dominate oil trading are also building up their
carbon-trading operations. Two of the oil majors, Shell and BP, have already amassed
sizable carbon-emissions trading divisions.

Hydrogen
1) The U.S. needs to stop China from dominating the fast-growing hydrogen sector,
top U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said during a virtual summit organized by the
Department of Energy (DOE). “Hydrogen Shot” is the first in a series of DOE events
that discuss how the U.S. will transition to clean energy. This past week, Kerry toured
Asia, including almost 3 days in China, to discuss policy ahead of the COP26 climate
summit. He said: “There is an enormous economic benefit for the U.S. to lead on
developing clean technologies” in what will be a “multi-trillion dollar” global industry,
adding that he believes China wants to dominate this market.

2) During the same hydrogen summit, billionaire Bill Gates said hydrogen is one of
four technology areas to benefit from $1.5 billion in financing in a new partnership
between his Breakthrough Energy climate fund and the DOE. Projects that jump start
new tech can potentially garner ten times more investment thanks to public-private
partnerships, Gates said. Hydrogen is likely to also benefit from significant
government inflows thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that includes
$9.5 billion for hydrogen-related projects.

Australia
UK-based renewables firm, RES, will sell the Dulacca wind farm to Octopus Australia,
which is part of the UK-based Octopus Group, a partner of Tokyo Gas. Once the deal
is completed, the Australian wind project, which is located 350 kilometers (210 miles)
northwest of Brisbane amid agricultural land, will consist of 43 wind turbines that can
generate enough electricity to power approximately 124,000 homes. Dulacca is
Octopus’ fourth renewable asset in Australia since entering the country in 2018.

China
1) China’s push to promote clean-fuel vehicles is producing strong results. Sales of
“new energy vehicles” (NEVs) have soared almost 300% in the first eight months of
2021, compared to the same period in 2020, said Xin Guobin, deputy head of the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The number of NEVs sold in China
from Jan. 1 to the end of August is projected to total about 1.7 million vehicles,
compared to 600,000 for the same period last year.

2) Three Gorges South Asia Investment has teamed up with other Chinese investors to
take over all of Alcazar Energy Partners, a leading renewables company in the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA). Established in 2015, Alcazar said the deal would allow

Three Gorges, which has mostly been focused on Pakistan and which is partly owned
by China’s sovereign wealth fund, to gain more exposure to the renewable energy
markets in the MENA region. Dubai-based Alcazar has a portfolio of five solar and two
wind projects in Egypt and Jordan, with a total operational capacity of 411 MW. The
MENA region has about 157 GW of renewable energy capacity, and as much as $175
billion is expected to be invested there over the next decade.

India
As India recovers from its Covid peak in spring and government restrictions are eased,
the return of domestic travel for business and personal reasons has led to a high jump
in demand for gasoline. The trend is labeled “revenge travel”. However, as health
concerns remain, much of the travel is with private transport. Passenger vehicle sales
rose by 45% to 264,442 units in July.

Ireland
State-controlled ESB acquired a majority stake in UK renewable energy supplier, So
Energy, to strengthen its position in the British retail market. ESB is a diversified and
vertically integrated Irish utility. It will take over 75% of So Energy. The merger will be
completed in several months. ESB has operated in the UK for nearly 30 years.

Ukraine
During high level meetings in Washington D.C., Ukraine agreed with the U.S. to
"deepen and intensify" their strategic cooperation in energy, with nuclear power at
the top of the agenda. As a pilot project, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom and
Westinghouse plan to complete the fourth reactor at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power
plant. This expansion would see nuclear providing as much as 72% of Ukraine's
electricity, thus reducing coal’s share in the mix. Also, during a visit to the White
House by President Volodymyr Zelensky, the countries agreed on measures to
decarbonize Ukraine's economy and to implement a plan to develop solar and wind
energy, hydrogen, energy storage, as well as carbon capture utilization and storage.

U.S.
On Aug 29-30, the second-worst hurricane in Louisiana history battered the oil and
gas-rich state on the Gulf of Mexico. The disaster incapacitated as much as 90% of
offshore oil and gas operations, leaving them offline for almost a week. There are
concerns that many oil wells in the region, which accounts for about 20% of total U.S.
output, could be out of action for weeks. Crews are returning to offshore facilities, but
many still remain vacant. Two pipelines, Nautilus and Garden Banks, which carry oil
and natural gas, respectively, are reported to be operational. There are also reports
that local oil refineries face electrical power shortages.
