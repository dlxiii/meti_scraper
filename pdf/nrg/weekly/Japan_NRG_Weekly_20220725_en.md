As non-grid power operators exit market, METI mulls freezing non-fossil power target
(Government Data, July 20)
•  Market share of power operators independent from regional grids has declined. Also, METI is is
studying the idea of freezing its target of boosting the share of non-fossil power retailers in the
market until an obvious increase in new non-fossil generation occurs.
•  In March 2022, independent operators (i.e., those not affiliated with EPCos, the legacy regional

utilities) accounted for 21.3% of the national power market, down from 21.7% in December 2021.
Their share in low-voltage power – which is consumed by households, offices and small business
facilities – slipped to 23.4% from 23.8%; for high-voltage power, consumed by industrial facilities,
the share declined to 27% from 28.3%.
•  CONTEXT: This is almost the first time since 2016 when “new electricity companies”, as the
independent retailers are known, have given up market share to major power utilities. While EPCos
run mostly thermal capacity, most new retailers are focused on renewables energy.
•  The number of nationwide power retailers decreased to 738 in June, from 743 in April.

• TAKEAWAY: One of the regions where independents gave up the most market share was Chubu, Japan’s
automotive heartland. Together with Tokyo, Chubu is forecast to suffer power shortages in winter. This shows
that supply security for major manufacturers is trumping any price savings expected from independents
compared with the major utilities.

• The government seems too busy with short-term energy issues to consider how they align with 2030 net-zero
targets. That said, METI is not looking to revise the nation’s 2030 energy plan or weaken the emissions
reduction goal, so the current situation should be considered in a crisis management context.

Power and gas market guidelines to be modified
(Japan NRG, July 20)
•  METI plans to modify market guidelines for power and gas, respectively, to reflect fuel costs on
power and gas service rates while protecting consumer interests. It plans to add a clause: “it is

generally seen as good practice to appropriately reflect the cost changes on power rates, to
maintain transparency of power rate setting and to increase benefit for the society as a whole.”
•  The gas retail guidelines will be revised to clarify how consumers will be protected in a liberalized
market. Gas retailers are advised to provide full detail of gas rate hikes, mechanisms on passing
fuel costs to consumers and price menus to mitigate impacts, as well as clearly stating on contracts
how the fuel surcharge price cap system works for consumers.
•  The changes in the guidelines, after approval by the sub-committee on basic electricity and gas

policies, will be open to public comments before the actual revision.
•  CONTEXT: Initially, METI planned to require power operators to pass on the fuel cost changes in
their rates, which met opposition from gas and power panel members as this would expose
consumers to risks. Panelists suggested offering more choice to consumers including rates that
directly reflect cost changes and those with different mechanisms. Forcing one pricing mechanism
onto operators is also against the spirit of free market competition, one panelist said.




Power grid body urges METI to secure LNG
(Japan NRG, July 20)
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPC) urged METI to purchase and stockpile LNG to
guarantee supply stability. Sasaki Toshiharu, the FEPC deputy chairman, told MET’s sub-committee
on basic electricity and gas policy, that securing gas supply is increasingly challenging on the back
of the Freeport accident and uncertainty over the Sakhalin 2 project.
•  In order to secure the supply to survive winter, the government is urged to take direct roles in

securing the fuel, Sasaki said.



Mitsubishi Heavy plans to produce hydrogen powered by nuclear energy
(Nikkei, July 19)
•  In collaboration with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is developing a technology to produce hydrogen powered by nuclear
energy on a commercial scale.
•  Mitsubishi will leverage the solid oxide electrolysis process and the temperatures generated by a

high temperature gas reactor (a type of nuclear reactor that operates at temperatures of up to 950°
C), to produce up to 25 metric tons of hydrogen per hour.
•  Unlike the steam reforming of methane or natural gas (the process often used to produce large
quantities of hydrogen), using nuclear energy means there is no output of CO2 emissions.
• TAKEAWAY: The technology refers to the HTTR nuclear program that Japan developed two decades ago. For
a detailed look at the nuclear tech and its compatibility with hydrogen production, please see the Jan. 24,

2022 edition of Japan NRG.

Thermal power plant glitches increase amid tight supply
(Japan NRG, July 20)
•  Unplanned closures by thermal power stations are increasing amid tight power supply. From July 2
to July 7, METI data showed a total of 2.5 GW of power plants were taken offline, an increase of
1.4 GW from a year ago.
•  METI said increases in variable renewable power are forcing thermal power plants to change run

rates frequently, causing the glitches. Some old plants cannot cope with rampant run rate changes,
METI reported.


METI judges how TEPCO coped with power crisis, forecasting questioned
(Japan NRG, July 20)
•  METI’s sub-committee on basic electricity and gas policies met to assess Tokyo Electric’s

management of the June power crisis and the lessons learnt, as well as the previous power crunch
in March.
•  Cold snap and heat waves unexpectedly hit in March and June, respectively, both before and after
the peak demand period.
•  In March, the major problem was a lack of communication between TEPCO and Tohoku Electric on
the usage of linkage power transmission lines that potentially caused a blackout due to overflow of
power.

•  OCCTO (Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of Transmission Operators) said the grids
were working well together to cope with the July crisis. But a review of TEPCO actions in July also
brought to light new issues, such as the need to improve forecasting.
•  TEPCO data showed that fully automated, AI-driven power supply and demand forecasts missed
the actuals by as much as 2 GWh. One sub-committee member, Prof. Matsuhashi Ryuji of Tokyo
University, said that 10 years ago when the forecast was done manually with a simpler model, the

gap was only 0.3 GWh.
•  The forecasts have become less accurate despite advances in analytical systems, possibly due to
increases in variable renewable in the power supply, and rampant temperature changes that are
beyond AI’s capacity. The causes of forecast gaps need to be fully investigated, Matsuhashi said.
•  TEPCO said solar power forecasts need to improve as the share of variable renewables increases.
Temperature forecasts often miss by a measure of 2° Celsius, which could alter demand forecasts
by over 2 GWh. TEPCO also pointed out that better communication within regional balancing

groups of power retailers would also help the grid get a grasp on area-wide demand conditions.
•  CONTEXT: As reported in the July 19 issue of Japan NRG, OCCTO urged the grids and Japan
Meteorological Agency to work closer together to improve forecasting. Meanwhile, forecast and
balancing group issues are relevant to all grids, not just TEPCO, METI said.
• TAKEAWAY: One sub-committee member insisted on conducting a thorough investigation on forecast
accuracy, but METI did not respond immediately to the suggestion. Even so, an informal review of demand

and supply forecasting models may now take place. Several overseas suppliers of forecasting software have
entered the Japanese market in recent years, but uptake for their services has been conservative. This may
now change.



West Japan electricity shortage eases amid Ohi restart
(MBS News, July 17)
•  On July 17, Ohi NPP Unit 4 (Kansai Electric) in Fukui Prefecture began supplying the grid.
•  While it had been feared in recent months that the electricity supply in west Japan wouldn’t keep
up with demand, the situation has improved, and the latest reactor restart will boost available
capacity.
•  Unit 4 was scheduled to restart in March, but the date was pushed back after leaks were found in

plumbing.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kansai Electric restarts Unit 3 of Takahama NPP
(Company Statement, July 22)
o  The 870 MW reactor concluded the bulk of its periodic inspection and is scheduled to

restart on July 24.
o  After that, various tests will be conducted as part of the final stage of the periodic
inspection. On Aug. 19, a comprehensive load and performance inspection will be
conducted, and full-scale power operations will resume.
• TAKEAWAY: With the restart of the Takahama unit, Japan will have seven nuclear reactors online. After that,
there’ll be just one more reactor restart, each by Kansai Electric and Kyushu Electric, before peak winter

demand. Then the country will comfortably reach the nine-reactor target set by PM Kishida.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Generators’ federation says nine reactors still not enough

(Nikkei, July 15)
o  Federation of Electric Power Companies chair and Kyushu Electric CEO Ikebe Kazuhiro
said that even with nine nuclear units operating, Japan is likely to face power shortages in
winter.
o  The comments came in response to a recent pledge by PM Kishida to have nine nuclear
reactors running in time for winter.
o  Ikebe said the restart of the nine units was already figured into projections and restarting

shuttered coal-fired stations may be needed to ensure adequate supply.



TEPCO seeks price increase to power tariffs in September; Chubu also
(Nikkei Shimbun, July 21)
•  TEPCO and Chubu Electric will ask the government to confirm a 13th monthly tariff increase until
September on the back of high fuel costs. In this period of just over a year, power prices are up
about 30-40%.
•  Some TEPCO contracts will no longer be able to automatically pass on higher fuel prices to

customers. If TEPCO is left with no financial leeway, it will stall investment in new power plants.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  TEPCO's rates will likely rise about ¥8 to around ¥9,126 for the average household, while Chubu’s
increase could be ¥360 to around ¥9,110, according to Nikkei calculations.
•  CONTEXT: Under the fuel price adjustment system, power companies can only pass on to
consumers up to 1.5 times the base price, no matter how much fuel prices rise. When prices gain
more than that, the utilities must bear the costs.
•  From early fall, most utilities will have hit the ceiling for how much they can increase tariffs.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

(NHK, July 21)
o  In October, Tokyo Gas will increase tariffs to reflect higher energy costs.
o  The increase will be more than ¥280/ month for the average household.



As energy costs soar, Japan power utilities rush to secure cash
(Nikkei Asia, July 18)
•  Japanese power utilities are increasing fundraising via bond sales as high prices for natural
resources and a weak yen deplete their cash holdings; total bond offerings this fiscal year will rise
6% to ¥1.73 trillion ($12.4 billion).
•  The amount of debt issued by 10 power utilities accounted for 23% of the total sum by Japanese

companies in Q2, up 9% from fiscal 2021, according to Refinitiv.
•  Tohoku Electric Power plans to issue a record ¥280 billion in debt, to help finance safety measures
for the Onagawa NPP set to restart by February 2024.
•  Tepco Power Grid, a unit of TEPCO, will raise ¥360 billion, 60% more than the amount slated to
mature in FY2022. Kansai Electric plans to issue up to ¥400 billion.
•  Shikoku Electric will issue ¥125 billion in bonds; "If our cash flow deteriorates further, we could
increase the amount," said a person in charge of bond offerings.

Mitsui does not rule out abandoning Russia’s Sakhalin-2
(Denki Shimbun, July 21)
•  Yasunaga Tatsuo, chairman of Mitsui & Co., which owns shares in the current holding company for
the Sakhalin-2 project, said: "We need to maintain our interests in order to continue supplying
LNG to Japan.”
•  CONTEXT: Russian President Putin signed a decree transferring Sakhalin II assets from a company
in which Mitsui and Mitsubishi Corp have stakes, to a new Russian holding. Moscow said current
investors in Sakhalin-2 need to reapply to keep their stakes and that it will have the final say on

acceptance.
•  Yasunaga said he has no information about the conditions for investment in the new company.
•  Mitsui will consult with Japan’s government, but "if [Russian] conditions are unacceptable, then we

Tsutomu.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Why Japan needs to divest from Russian energy: Editorial

(Asahi Shimbun, July 19)
o  CONTEXT: This is an editorial in one of Japan’s top five newspapers. Asahi is politically
left-leaning.
o  The government must not flinch in the face of Russian threats to seize Japanese interests
in the Sakhalin-2 LNG project.
o  Russia is requiring Japanese trading firms and other shareholders to consent to the
transfer of assets to a new state entity established under presidential order.

o  While Moscow cited “breach of contract” as reason for its actions, no basis was provided.
In fact, Russia’s actions may violate an agreement on investor protection.
o  Giving into Russia’s demands would play into their hands, and such a move would
compromise solidarity between Japan, the U.S. and Europe, and reduce the efficacy of
sanctions imposed on Russia.
o  Instead, the government should assert legitimacy of its claims to Sakhalin-2 and work with

the private sector to prepare for the possibility that Russia will cut off gas supplies in order
to pressure Japan.

Japan’s gasoline demand returns to pre-Covid level
(Sekiyu Tsushin, July 21)
•  The head of the Petroleum Association of Japan, Sugimori, said "demand for gasoline has
returned to pre-Covid levels,” adding that oil refining major ENEOS, where he is also CEO, no

longer expects demand impact from the pandemic.
•  While there is a slight drop off in demand compared to three years ago, Sugimori said this was due
to the spread of hybrid and EVs.
•  Separately, ENEOS will try to boost output of fuel oil that can be burned in thermal power plants
this winter, answering the government’s call for more thermal capacity to be available during a
power crunch.
•  CONTEXT: Demand for fuel oil from power utilities remains high due to record LNG prices.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Can Next-Generation Batteries provide EVs with a Breakthrough,
Or Will Geopolitics Stymie Progress?

The race for more durable and efficient all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) that could
potentially replace lithium-ion batteries in powering electric vehicles is heating up.
Japanese companies are competing vigorously against international rivals, with
Toyota Motor the outright leader in next-generation battery patents worldwide.
If the Japanese makers succeed, then these innovations will significantly change the
battery raw materials landscape. How Japan and others handle this shift will
determine who controls the global shift to cleaner mobility.



The emergence of “green” geopolitics
ASSBs, which promise to cut EV charging times and boost driving range, are still at a
prototype stage. Which means the jury is out on the materials that would be required
for their key components – the cathode, anode and electrolyte. While much of the
current conversation revolves around lithium, attempts are also being made to try new
materials such as silicon metal, indium and others.

The chemical and metallic makeup of the technology matters not only from an
environmental perspective. The mining, refining and processing of many of the
materials currently slated for use in EV batteries takes place in China.

The grim irony of the green energy revolution for Japan is that unless it accelerates
plans to secure critical raw materials elsewhere, it will find its current dependency on
Middle Eastern oil replaced by another energy dependency on rival China.
Recently, awareness of the implications is rising in Japan. In the past few months, the
government has signed pacts with the U.S. to create frameworks and systems that
would challenge China’s top position in rare earths, allowing the allies to move forward
with ASSB with confidence.

And just last month, Australian miner Lynas Rare Earths, which counts the Japanese
government among its major backers, was awarded a $120 million contract by the U.S.
Department of Defense to build a processing facility in Texas. Lynas has supply
agreements with Japan, which has priority rights until 2038.
Geopolitical considerations aside, cost reductions in battery manufacturing are one key
to a wider spread of EVs. This is where ASSB can play a pivotal role. This is where the
development of new materials and more efficient and recyclable systems are needed.



Nissan’s big ambitions for ASSB
Scientists expect that the energy density of ASSB will be twice as powerful as the
current liquid lithium-ion batteries, allowing for a 30% reduction in charging time. This
would mean longer trips and less worry for drivers. Mass production of ASSBs,
however, is still at least six years away.

In April, Nissan Motor unveiled its prototype ASSB cell as part of its long-term vision,
“Nissan Ambition 2030”, by which the company aims to launch an EV with all-solid-
state batteries by FY2028.

Nissan plans to establish a pilot production line at its Yokohama Plant in FY2024, and
the company believes all-solid-state battery costs can drop to $75 per kWh in fiscal
2028 and subsequently to $65 per kWh. This would place EVs at the same cost level
as gasoline-powered vehicles.

Nevertheless, there have been setbacks in effort to develop ASSBs. For example,
Toyota Motor disappointed the industry last year when it failed to deliver the world’s
first ASSB-powered taxi for the Tokyo Olympics.

EVs, in general, are struggling to secure market share in Japan. While the country’s EV
sales hit a record high in March – 4,219 vehicles, that amount only represented a 5%
market share. Meanwhile, hybrid vehicles proved far more successful, taking a 48%
share. Gasoline vehicles still finished with 44% of the market.

Despite government subsidies equivalent to $4,000-6,000 for every EV purchased,
sales are struggling. As consumer budgets downsize on energy and food inflation,
dealers are not keen to sell EVs. The bitter truth is that lithium-ion batteries have
failed customer expectations.

Advantages of ASSB
Lithium-ion in an electrolyte solution travels between cathode and anode to generate
electricity. ASSB’s electrolyte is solid, removing the risk of solution leakages and fire.

Other advantages are:

— Easy to pack the modules and the cells are flexible to shape

— Longer lifecycle

— Able to operate in -40ºC to 100ºC temperatures

The major challenge is electrical resistance in the interface between the solid
electrolyte and the cathode that hampers battery performance and speeds up battery
component degradation. Solid electrolytes are vulnerable to moisture, but new
materials that resist such drawbacks have been key to successful ASSB development.

Establishing low power and environmentally sustainable manufacturing of the
materials has been equally important. An ideal version would be made of recycled
materials and could itself be easily recycled. The volumes that would such ideals,
however, are not yet there.



Flourishing ASSB projects
Various ASSB types have been developed so far, using different combinations of
oxide and sulfides-based lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese. There are also
initiatives to test new material. Silicon metal and indium used for some anodes are
electrically conductive materials that have track records in solar batteries.

State-run research hub NEDO has an ASSB evolution scenario. The current version in
development is the first generation. The second generation will be fluoride-ion ASSB,
which replaces lithium with fluorine. Toyota Motor is developing this technology. The
third generation would be zinc ASSB, whose key components will be made of zinc.
Raw material market
The choice of materials for battery components has been important not only for
performance but also for controlling costs. Presently, batteries are said to account for
30% of EV production costs. Around 70% of battery costs come from raw materials;
namely, lithium hydroxide and carbonate, nickel, manganese and cobalt for the
cathode, lithium carbonate for the electrolyte, and graphite for the anode.
According to Goldman Sachs, lithium is the recent world volatility champion, rising
eight-fold in the last two years from $8,000/ ton in 2020 to $60,000-70,000/ ton. The
bank forecasts that prices will ease on the back of Chinese investments to increase
supply, but will remain elevated at avoe pre-Covide levels.
Shifts to ASSB will unlikely affect demand for lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as
they will still be used but in different ways. One possibility is a decline in cobalt
consumption, which automakers have been striving for and have achieved for some
models.

NEDO forecasts this trend will continue, possibly by replacing cobalt with nickel. ASSB
will also trigger usage of raw materials that were not used before. Mitsui Mining and
Smelting has begun sample shipments of A-SOLiD, an argyrodite sulfide electrolyte.

Diversification of ASSB raw materials may mean more dependency on China. While
lithium raw materials - brine and spodumene – are found in South America and
Australia, China dominates production of their intermediate product, lithium metal.

With its abundant high-grade silica deposits, China is also a global silicon metal giant.
Still, there are elements that Japan does not have to worry too much about. Indium is
one. While China dominates primary indium production, Japanese recyclers have
been recovering the metal from flat panel displays and other digital scrap, achieving
99.999% purity. Japan is also a leading producer of titanium products.

Also, in a bid to increase self-sufficiency of battery materials, the government is
pushing battery-to-battery recycling. The latest recycling breakthrough came from
Dowa Eco Systems, which established a process to separate lithium carbonate from
scrap batteries.

It is not yet clear which material and which process will become the ASSB mainstream.
The successful development of powerful and reliable ASSB will reduce battery sizes as
well as per unit raw material consumption that may cut costs.
If Japan can successfully develop ASSB technology that will lower EV production
costs, and secure sufficient metal supplies from its global allies, then the chances of
EVs becoming more widespread will become a reality. If not, then a critical part of the
green energy revolution will remain in doubt.

ANALYSIS

BY JEREMY BOWDEN

As Japan Gears Up for Offshore Wind Expansion,
What Can It Learn from the UK and Other Markets?

As Japan struggles to lower the cost of offshore wind energy, fretting over its deep waters
and less regular winds, the successful rollout of the technology elsewhere shows these
factors are not the whole story.

The UK’s offshore wind sector has installed almost 10 GW in the last decade and targets
50 GW by 2030 largely due to a consistent and effective policy framework. That has
allowed for long-term planning and development of an extensive and large-scale supply
chain in the UK, which in turn has driven down costs.

In contrast, Japan’s continued wrangling over rules for offshore wind auctions has already
drawn major global turbine manufacturers to reconsider setting up local production. Yet
without Japan-made components, the ability to reduce costs will be extremely hampered.

Should the rule-making issues get resolved, Japan has many of the key ingredients for
success. Like the UK, Japan has a number of companies active in oil and gas exploration.
It is that sector and the many engineering and support services companies involved that
have since adapted to offshore wind.

After all, there are many crossovers. For example, Equinor’s floating wind substructures
are cast in concrete using the same technology as the legs for its Troll natural gas
platform.

With water depth also less of a factor in the UK as more of its projects move further
offshore, Japan should take heart that geography won’t be a handicap.

Contracts for Difference
So, what did the UK do to make its offshore wind industry come alive in the last decade?
One key starting point is the power purchasing scheme.

The UK government provides price guarantees for 15 years under its Contracts for
Difference (CFD) auction scheme, which it awards based on the lowest price offered. This
allows for competition and lowest possible prices, but does not inhibit investors with
concerns about future revenue. In fact, after the Round 3 auctions in 2019, sector
financings in the first half of 2020 totaled $35 billion.

Under CFDs, the government pays a top up between the market price and the
guaranteed level, while the wind farm pays the government if the price goes above this
level. This means that currently, with market prices at £200/ MWh and above, some wind
farms are actually paying significant sums to the government.

Plants outside this support structure, (i.e. those that came in before it was introduced or
the very new projects) are now making more money in spot sales. This is further
encouraging business models that do not rely on CFDs, such as PPAs or direct sales to the
electricity wholesale market.
Still, the revenue stability of a CFD is attractive, and other nations like Germany are
considering adopting a similar system.


Oil and gas companies join utilities
Another catalyst for the UK wind market was the entry of international oil companies.
Firms like Equinor were already present in the UK. To develop the new offshore wind
sector, these oil majors partnered with UK utilities – a pattern that also seems to be
emerging in Japan.

A change in 2021 to the lease-holding rules for offshore wind farms may encourage this
further as it imposes higher leasing fees. Critics say only oil majors have deep enough
pockets to cover them. Since the introduction of the new rule, TotalEnergies together with
Green Investment Group, and BP in partnership with German utility EnBW, have secured
more than half of the 8 GW of capacity on offer.

Still, even before the rule change, offshore wind projects needed large and long-term
financing commitments that naturally favored big energy firms, which typically have roots
in hydrocarbons.

The outlook for the maturing UK sector is for BP and Total to secure further capacity via
CFDs and for Shell to be among the top bidders. These same companies show interest in
Japanese offshore wind projects and will likely tie up with local utilities and other firms.
The local groups that they’ll bid against will also feature Japanese utility blue chips like
Tokyo Gas, JERA, and J-Power, as well as the trading houses.

The strong competition in the Japan market has shocked some local utilities and fueled
lobbying efforts that now delay further auctions while rules are reviewed. Should the
government cave in, and accept that price is no longer a key factor, then Japan’s offshore
wind sector may have a short history. That competition is precisely what has brought UK
wind power prices below those of fossil fuel generation, convincing consumers to switch.

Meanwhile, a CFD model could help prevent bidders that seek to delay the start of their
work since the contracts have clearly defined timelines.


Latest UK auctions and prices
The latest UK CFD round (Round 4) secured 11 GW of renewables, including offshore
wind, floating wind and tidal - all for delivery between 2023 and 2027. It began last
December, and awards were made on July 7.

Of the total, offshore wind development accounted for 7 GW of capacity and saw new
record low bids of £37.35/ MWh (inflation indexed to 2012 prices). That was the winning
offer from Vattenfall for the 1.4 GW Norfolk Boreas farm, and the same from Orsted for
the giant 2.9 GW Hornsea 3 project, the world’s largest. The lowest floating offshore wind
award was at £87.30/ MWh.

For comparison, the lowest winning bids from Mitsubishi Corp. in the Japanese offshore
auctions last year came at around £75-80/ MWh.

The prices of UK’s offshore wind projects have declined rapidly since the auctions began.
In the previous Round 3, from September 2019, the lowest bid was £39.65/MWh, much
less than the government forecast. That bid in 2019 was 30% lower than in the previous
Round 2 (2017) and a whole 70% less than in Round 1 (2015).

Round 5 is due in March 2023 with plans for larger floating wind farms, more tidal and the
opening up of new offshore provinces such as the Celtic Sea.


Other price reduction tools
Some projects in Germany and the Netherlands are proceeding without price guarantees
– partly due to the provision of grid connections, which cuts costs compared to UK
projects. Should Japan proceed with a mooted plan to build subsea cables from its
northern Hokkaido areas to the northeast of the main island, it could lower the cost of
generation while increasing the overall energy security of its fragmented grid.

Other factors contributing to drastic cuts in UK wind prices over the last seven years owe
to the introduction of larger turbines and the winning locations’ high wind speeds. Project
extensions close to existing wind farms are also allowing developers to share costs across
projects. Meanwhile, as the market matures, the efficiency of installations improves and
utilities lean on suppliers to reduce prices.

The final, and perhaps most vital input, is the cost of financing. While the UK, like many
other nations, is raising interest rates to combat inflation, Japan appears determined to
stick to its low-interest rate environment. Of course, rising raw materials prices and the
weak yen will surely impact the financial models of bidders, but the chance to access low-
interest loans should cool some of the cost inflation.

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Algeria/ Oil
Algeria’s Sonatrach, in partnership with Occidental, TotalEnergies and ENI, will invest
$4 billion dollars in the Berkine basin in order to produce nearly 1 billion of oil
equivalent barrels when it’s operational.

Belgium/ Hydrogen energy
Tree Energy Solutions, a hydrogen energy start-up, secured €65 million in its latest
funding round. Among the investors are HSBC, UniCredit and Germany’s Eon. The
funding means that Tree Energy Solutions is valued at about €700 million.

Europe/ Gas pipeline
Gazprom resumed gas supplies through Nord Stream 1 after weeks of repair issues
that threatened a total stoppage. However, Gazprom warned EU customers that in
theory gas supplies still could be disrupted due to an "act of God”. Such a clause
releases a party from legal obligations. This doesn’t mean Gazprom will stop
deliveries, but rather that it won't feel responsible if it fails to meet contract terms.

France/ Nuclear power
The government will fully nationalize debt-laden EDF, offering to pay €9.7 billion to
take full control of the utility that is also Europe's biggest nuclear power operator.
EDF’s minority shareholders will be offered €12/ share, a 53% premium over the
closing price on July 5.
Germany/ Nuclear power
The government might continue operating three remaining nuclear power plants, in
contradiction to former Chancellor Merkel’s promise in 2011 to phase out nuclear
energy following Japan’s Fukushima accident that same year. Germany's nuclear
plants are scheduled to be shut by end of 2022.

Guyana/ Oil
Bound by contracts with oil firms that are said to be “too one-sided”, the government
shelved plans for a state-run oil company. A group led by Exxon Mobil, Hess Corp
and CNOOC has found about 11 billion barrels of oil in the country’s waters. They
expect to pump 1.2 mbpd in 2027, putting Guyana ahead of Venezuela in production.

Iran/ Russia/ Oil
On the occasion of President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Tehran, the National Iranian Oil
Company signed a $4 billion oil deal with Gazprom, the biggest such deal ever with
Moscow. Iran says it needs “$160 billion in investment in its oil and natural gas
industries in the coming years”.

Italy/ Oil corruption case
Italian prosecutors dropped a legal challenge to the acquittal of Eni and Shell in a
corruption case over a deal in Nigeria. The trial is one of the oil industry's biggest
corruption cases, involving the $1.3 billion purchase of a Nigerian oilfield in 2012.

Mongolia/ Gas pipeline
The country’s PM said that in two years Russia will go ahead with the “Power of
Siberia 2” gas pipeline, which will for the first time connect the Siberian gas fields to
China, via Mongolia. The PM also said Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine
project was on schedule.

Oil/ Prices
Oil prices have fallen and stabilized on fears that a global economic slowdown will
lessen oil demand. By July 20, Brent crude prices for September fell 43 cents to settle
at $106.92 a barrel, in part due to lower summer demand in the U.S., where the price
of gasoline now is about $4.25 to $4.60/ gallon, down from $5/ gallon in early July.

Russia/ Oil payments
Russia seeks payment in the United Arab Emirates’ currency, dirhams, to pay for oil
export deals to Indian customers. This is part of Moscow’s plans to move away from
the U.S. dollar in order to insulate the country from Western sanctions.
