Japan, China to launch joint clean-coal technology project in Shaanxi province
(Japan NRG, Dec. 27)
At the 15th Japan-China Forum on Energy Conservation and Environment METI announced a plan to
launch a “clean-coal technology” pilot project in China’s Shaanxi province. The Forum was held online
on Dec. 26, with METI and MoE ministers, and key National Development Reform Commission officials
from China delivering keynote addresses. Here are some major highlights from the forum:
•  The Shaanxi project will be Japan’s first major coal methanation rollout overseas.

•  Coal methanation converts carbon emitted from a coal-fired power plant into synthetic methane by
combining carbon with green hydrogen. Methane can be a fuel for gas-fired power generators.
•  Hitachi Zosen will provide the methanation and hydrogen manufacturing equipment. Project
participants include the Japan Coal Frontier Organization (JCOAL), the Shaanxi regional
government and Yulin Chemical.
•  The plant’s methanation process will reduce emissions and is expected to run for several years.

•  Ten other bilateral projects were agreed at the Japan-China forum in the fields of hydrogen, fuel
cells, pollution control, and energy conservation. Still, this number of projects is lower than in
previous years due to pandemic-related travel restrictions. About 700 participants joined the forum
online.
•  CONTEXT: In a bid to spread “clean coal” technology in Asia, METI established the Asia CCUS
Network in June 2021. It does not include South Korea or China.
•  CONTEXT: As JCOAL is an active member of the Asia CCUS Network, the Shaanxi project will

possibly keep China connected to the Japanese initiatives to retain coal power while mitigating
emissions.
• TAKEAWAY: While bilateral ties in clean and green energy grow, PM Kishida’s government wants to regulate
trade with China more closely by legislating the Economic Security Act. This will allow the government to
check if components used for power and telecommunication infrastructure are sourced from suppliers with
economic security implications.

• The proposed act is expected to impact solar power operators as China has a dominant share in the
production of panels, mounts and other components. The move may curb Chinese investment in Japan’s
renewable sector. China’s Suntech runs 18 solar plants in Japan; total capacity of 37 MW.





Japan aims to introduce carbon capture technology before FY2030: Minister
(Nikkei, Jan. 7)
•  METI minister Hagiuda said Japan will introduce technology to capture CO2 and bury it
underground by 2030.
•  He said thermal power generation is needed for a stable supply of electricity, and intends to
maintain thermal power while reducing CO2 emissions in underground storage.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  So far, Japan has successfully stored 300,000 tons of CO2 in a demonstration project off the coast
of Tomakomai City, Hokkaido.
•  Hagiuda said many issues need to be addressed before commercialization of CCS, including cost
reduction and development of suitable sites.
•  METI will draw up a roadmap to work with the public and private sectors.

•  Hagiuda also said that Japan is paying attention to the U.S. experience of operating nuclear
reactors for 80 years. Japan’s reactors are currently only able to run to 60 years, but some want this
period to be brought in line with the U.S.


METI to set safety standards for ammonia and hydrogen-fired power by September 2022

(Japan NRG, Dec. 21)
•  By interviewing businesses in the industry, METI will set safety standards for ammonia and
hydrogen-fired power plants by September 2022. Prospective players include former regional grids
and smaller companies.
•  The ammonia/hydrogen power plants will fall in the thermal power plant category and safety
standards will be written in “government ordinances relevant to thermal power plant operations”.

Licensing, approvals and reporting rules will be set at a later date.
•  CONTEXT: Last year, JERA started ammonia co-firing on a trial basis at its 1 GW Hekinan-4 USC
coal plant, and the ammonia ratio will be gradually raised to 20% in 2024. ANRE estimates co-
firing will first spread among 28 USC coal plants with a total capacity of 22 GW.



Parliament approves 2021 supplementary budget
(Japan NRG, Dec. 20)
•  The parliament on Dec. 20 approved the fiscal 2021 supplementary budget of over ¥35 trillion.
METI’s budget was ¥5.4 trillion. Over half will support COVID-hit businesses.
•  Major energy items:

Government to invest ¥20 billion in perovskite

(Nikkei, Dec. 28)
o  The government-backed NEDO said it would invest ¥20 billion in the development of
perovskite solar panel technology.
o  Light and flexible, perovskite promises to halve solar panel prices.
o  The funding comes from the ¥2-trillion Green Innovation fund that supports research by
the likes of Toshiba, Sekisui Chemical and Tokyo University.




METI launches studies on power market reforms
(Japan NRG, Dec. 28)
•  METI launched a group on power market structure in response to calls for reforms. It will review the

wholesale and supply-demand adjustment market mechanisms to ensure efficient sourcing of
power while increasing renewables.
•  The review won’t affect METI’s plan to introduce power in-balancing rates in 2022 and a new
capacity market in 2024.
•  The group will look into a lack of supply in the wholesale spot market and disconnects between
different market mechanisms. Usually, when power demand increases in winter, disconnects

between power retailers and suppliers are common, as suppliers don’t know if retailers have
enough supplies. In the end, suppliers must cover any deficit.
•  Retailers need to increase risk awareness, and an effective demand response system must be
established, said an official at the Transmission and Distribution Grid Council. The seven-member
panel is chaired by Tsutomu Ohyama of the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of
Transmission Operators (OCCTO). The panel will report its findings to the Electricity and Gas
Market Surveillance Commission.
• TAKEAWAY: While the review doesn’t cover capacity auctions, Prof. Yumiko Iwafune of Tokyo University

pointed out that the October capacity auction level was alarmingly low and may trigger plant closures.



METI Minister, US Energy Secretary agree to strengthen cooperation on nuclear
(Japan NRG, Jan. 6)
•  During a Jan. 6 online meeting, METI Minister Koichi Hagiuda and U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer
Granholm agreed to strengthen bilateral initiatives to develop next-gen nuclear power technology.
Japan will test SMRs and high-speed reactors developed by NuScale and other companies.



Japan restarts experimental nuclear reactor
(Nikkei, Jan. 5)
•  JAEA restarted its experimental high temperature, gas-cooled nuclear reactor (HTGR) after 10
years idle. Media were given a tour.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Geiger counters mounted on the reactor exterior read zero, showing that not even a minuscule
amount of radiation escapes.
•  HTGRs are safer than traditional reactors because the fuel rods have a melting point of over 2,500
C.The rods used in traditional reactors begin to melt when temperatures exceed 1,200 degrees.
•  While Toshiba and Fujitsu are both developing HTGR technology, the Japanese government has

yet to endorse it.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Nuclear-powered hydrogen generator unveiled to media
(Nikkei Xtech, Dec. 28)
o  The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) unveiled a prototype of a system that uses heat
from a nuclear reactor to generate hydrogen.

o  The facility uses a multistage process, known as the IS process, which has temperatures
as high as 900 C to reduce sulfuric acid and hydrogen iodide.
o  While the prototype achieves the required temperatures with electric elements, the
system is powered by a high-temperature gas reactor.
o  The JAEA envisages systems capable of generating up to 1,000 m3 of hydrogen per
hour, which may be possible by 2040.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Molten sodium from experimental reactor to be sent to UK
(NHK, Dec. 24)
o  The government says molten sodium recovered from the Monju experimental fast
breeder reactor that’s being decommissioned will be sent to the UK for processing.
o  A MoA was signed with Cavendish Nuclear and Jacobs on Dec. 21.



Surplus power from nuclear plants to produce hydrogen
(NHK, Dec. 23)
•  In a first for Japan, Tsuruga City and Kansai Electric launched an initiative to use surplus power
from local nuclear power stations to generate hydrogen.
•  Hydrogen fueling stations will be built and Tsuruga City vehicles replaced with hydrogen vehicles.

•  Tsuruga City wants to become carbon neutral.


Toyota Tsusho to test hydrogen derived from manure as truck fuel at U.S. port
(Asia Nikkei, Dec. 22)
•  A Toyota Motor group member will start a 4-year test at one of the largest U.S. ports using cargo

equipment powered by hydrogen derived from animal waste.
•  The pilot program takes place at the Port of Los Angeles until March 2026 and will be run by
Japanese commodity and equipment distributor Toyota Tsusho.
•  It will involve seven pieces of machinery powered by fuel cells, including a crane, machines that
offload containers, and trucks.
•  The hydrogen will come from renewable natural gas or biomethane. Derived from farm manure

improved to fuel-grade, this gas helps reduce CO2 emissions.

Idemitsu reorganizes agri-bio business for faster growth

(Japan NRG, Dec. 21)
•  Oil refiner Idemitsu Kosan will spin off its agri-bio business unit in July 2022 for a merger with SDS
Biotech, a subsidiary. SDS Biotech was a chemical joint venture between Showa Denko and
Diamond Shamrock, which Idemitsu acquired in 2011.
•  SDS Biotech will take over all Idemitsu agri-bio operations including manufacturing of cattle
compound feed, which generated annual revenue of ¥2.6 billion ($22 million). Idemitsu and SDS

Biotech want to maximize the potential of micro-organisms, and the merger will allow them to
share manufacturing technologies and R&D results.
•  Idemitsu’s Ruminup is Japan’s leading methane-reducing cattle compound feed, cutting methane
emissions 20%. The product was first sold in 2011. Ruminup’s main ingredient is cashew nut shell
liquid (CNSL) from Vietnam. CNSL helps cows’ stomachs reduce methane. Product inquiries started
to increase after last summer due to growing concerns about GHGs. The product is exported

across Asia.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s methane release was 28.2 million CO2 equivalent tons in FY2020; 21.9 million
tons came from rice farming, livestock and other agricultural production. Methane release must be
cut 30% by 2030, from 2020 levels. For the last two years, biomass power operators have lobbied
for approval to use CNSL for power generation. Japan imports around 5,000 tons/year of CNSL
and only 10-20% of the imports have been used for livestock feed production, according to market
sources.



Two municipalities delist from Fukushima radioactivity monitoring areas; 86 remain
(Japan NRG, Dec. 27)
•  Two municipalities were removed from the list of areas subject to regular radioactivity monitoring
and decontamination programs in 2021. In March, Watari Town of Miyagi Prefecture, and effective

Dec. 28, Otama Village, were removed since radioactivity measured below 0.23 microsieverts/
hour on average. The government and municipalities jointly measure radioactivity levels.
•  Watari and Otawa are 60-70 km away from the Fukushima plant. 86 municipalities in Fukushima
and seven surrounding prefectures remain under monitoring and local decontamination programs.
The more severely affected Futaba Town, the plant site, and six adjacent municipalities are under
separate programs of the central government.
• TAKEAWAY: Radioactivity is measured 50-100 cm above ground using gamma ray instruments. Underground

water, dioxin, sulfuric acid, and dust around waste treatment facilities are also monitored. The total population
of the 86 municipalities under surveillance exceeds 1 million.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Fukushima worker may have been exposed to radiation
(FNN Prime Online, Jan. 6)
o  A worker at the Fukushima nuclear power plant is believed to have suffered internal
radiation exposure from inhaled air.
o  It’s unknown how the worker, who was wearing a mask, was exposed.

New garbage trucks to run on rubbish
(Newswitch, Dec. 24)
•  Kawasaki City commissioned JFE Engineering to develop garbage trucks that will be powered by
electricity generated from incinerating garbage.

•  Rather than being recharged at charging stands, the trucks will have their batteries swapped for
fully-charged ones.
•  The system is dubbed the ‘Zero E’ garbage collection system.


Challenergy eyes cyclones as energy source

(Nikkei, Dec. 20)
•  Tokyo-based Challenergy will build a prototype vertical wind turbine in Madagascar to generate
electricity from winds of up to 40 m/sec.
•  The 10-kW turbine will begin operating in or before 2023 and take advantage of the region’s high
incidence of cyclones and typhoons.
•  Challenergy already operates similar turbines in the Philippines.

12,000 companies in Japan obliged to set targets on adoption of green energy

(Yomiuri Shimbun, Jan. 6)
•  About 12,000 firms in Japan will be asked to set targets to switch to renewable energy as early as
2023, according to a new government policy to be submitted to parliament in the new session that
starts this month. The policy is part of a revised Law on the Rational Use of Energy.
•  Companies that consume energy equivalent to at least 1,500 kiloliters of crude oil annual will be
subject to the policy. This is to encourage firms to switch from fossil fuels to CO2-free sources.
•  METI will work out the exact rules, but it seems that firms will need to set targets based on a ratio

that renewables will amount to in their total energy use.
•  Companies will also need to submit an annual report to government to explain what efforts they
are undertaking to use CO2-free energy.

Mitsubishi the big winner in Japan's first commercial offshore wind tenders
(Japan NRG, Dec. 24)
•  Three tender results announced:
819 MW Yurihonjo City wind farm offshore Akita Prefecture
No. of bidders: 5
Winning consortium: Mitsubishi Corporation Energy Solutions Ltd., Venti Japan Inc., C-Tech
Corporation, and Mitsubishi Corporation
Project partners: Amazon.com, Inc, NTT Anode Energy Corporation, Kirin Holdings
Planned start of operations: December 2030
Winning tariff price: ¥13.26/ kWh

479 MW Noshiro City, Mitane Town, Oga City project, Akita Prefecture
No. of bidders: 5
Winning consortium: Mitsubishi Corporation Energy Solutions Ltd., C-Tech Corporation, and
Mitsubishi Corporation
Project partners: Amazon.com, Inc, NTT Anode Energy Corporation, Kirin Holdings
Planned start of operations: December 2028
Winning tariff price: ¥11.99/ kWh

391 MW Choshi City project off Chiba Prefecture
No. of bidders: 2
Winning consortium: Mitsubishi Corporation Energy Solutions Ltd., C-Tech Corporation, and
Mitsubishi Corporation
Project partners: Amazon.com, Inc, NTT Anode Energy Corporation, Kirin Holdings
Planned start of operations: September 2028
Winning tariff price: ¥16.49/ kWh

•  All three projects will use GE Haliade-X wind turbines.
•  In all three projects, the group led by Mitsubishi achieved a much higher rating from METI and the

local government than its rivals groups.
•  Note: the partners in each project are the same; according to the statement from the consortium,
the partners will help with regional promotion strategy.
•  CONTEXT: Mitsubishi is Japan's biggest trading house and one of the top LNG
importers. Mitsubishi Corporation Energy Solutions is one of its subsidiaries and handles overall
energy management for customers.
•  CONTEXT: C-Tech Corporation is part of Chubu Electric group, which is one of Japan’s top power

utilities and owner of half of JERA Corp., the country’s biggest operator of thermal power plants
and top buyer of LNG.
•  CONTEXT: Venti Japan is a company focused on renewable energy in the Akita area.
• TAKEAWAY: These results raised many eyebrows for different reasons. Some in the industry noted that
handing the entire first batch of projects to the same two companies, moreover firms who have not built a

single watt of offshore wind capacity in Japan or neighboring countries, smelled of favoritism. Especially since
experience in developing offshore wind in Japan was supposed to be one of the selection criteria.

• Price was one reason for picking the same winner. When tender conditions were first announced, the upper
ceiling was set at ¥29/ kWh. Privately, some Japanese companies complained it was too low. Yet Mitsubishi
and Chubu Electric won with proposed rates at less than half that level. Firms such as TEPCO and Obayashi
Corp. envisaged much higher rates and must now reconsider how to compete. TEPCO hopes to develop at
least 2 GW of offshore wind in Japan and overseas by FY2030.

• The reason Mitsubishi and Chubu won at lower prices may well lie in their ability to lock in early off-site PPAs
or secure other premiums from buyers such as Amazon, which believes they can pass on costs to their clients.

• Also, Mitsubishi and METI believe that sourcing three projects at once brings economies of scale. It’s
interesting that all three projects will use GE’s Haliade-X turbines. This both reduces costs and at the same
time conveniently places an order for 1.7 GW of capacity to both GE and its new Japanese partner, Toshiba.
• Incidentally, Toshiba is embroiled in a scandal over shareholder dealings which is at least partly the work of

METI. Toshiba’s future is on the line. Winning a large bulk order as GE’s strategic partner to manufacture the
turbines partly in Japan is potentially METI’s way to repay and support Toshiba, and as an extension, support
the building of a domestic wind turbine supply chain led by GE-Toshiba.
• Top European offshore wind operators that made bids will wonder why their know-how was ignored. They and

others considered favorites, such as TEPCO and Renova, will get a chance later this year in a tender for a
single area off the coast of Happo Town and Noshiro City in Akita Prefecture. However, they will need to pay
attention to the winning price of the first three auctions.

• Surprisingly, a few Japanese media described the winning rates as higher than expected. One way that could
make sense is when we remember that METI has said several times that it hoped to bring the price of offshore
wind to ¥8/ kWh by FY2030, just one-two years after these projects come online. The same media then
suggested that the ¥8 level is now expected by 2035, subtly shifting the government narrative.

• This means bids in new METI tenders that start around 2030 will still be accepted above the ¥8 level. The
message seems to be: bid in the low 10s or walk away. So, the number of interested players will likely shrink.
• It’s clear that METI wanted to deal with one familiar set of players to iron out any kinks before wider

deployment of offshore wind. METI also needs to show that its efforts in renewables are on track and it’s not
repeating the early years of Feed-In Tariff largess.
• We expect competition for this year’s tender to be intense.



Local solar tax is a first for Japan
(Smart Japan, Dec. 23)
•  Councilors of the town of Mimasaka (Okayama) approved a bylaw to tax commercial users of
photovoltaic panels.
•  Scheduled to take effect in 2023, the bylaw is a first for Japan.
•  Operators of standalone solar farms rated at 10 kW or more will be taxed ¥50 per sq/m of panel

area for five years after installation, but farms in areas that are not sloping or prone to landslides
will be exempt from the tax.
•  Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA) came out against the tax, saying it will equal 2% of
revenue earned by affected operators.

Japan’s spot power prices hold stable compared to Europe
(Japan NRG, Dec. 27)
•  Japan’s spot power prices in December averaged ¥17.3/ kWh, up from ¥7.9/ kWh in September,

but held stable compared to Europe. December prices averaged ¥41.2/ kWh in the UK, ¥38.8/
kWh in Italy and ¥33.5/ kWh in Spain.
•  A cold spell hit the European continent earlier, and gas supplies from Russia appear to be limited.
Japan may see soaring power prices as winter storms are soon expected.
•  As of Dec. 23, Japan’s LNG stocks stood at 2.42 million tons, up from 2.16 million tons at end
November. Tight supply conditions will continue into summer 2022 as Joban Joint Power’s 600

MW coal-fired power plant and JERA’s 1 GW coal plant went offline due to technical issues and

TEPCO struggles to keep up with demand as Tokyo hit by snow

(ITmedia News, Jan. 6)
•  TEPCO asked Hokkaido Electric, Tohoku Electric, Chubu Electric and KEPCO to send all available
electricity to Tokyo as low temperatures saw demand reach 97% of capacity.
•  TEPCO is asking subscribers to be efficient with energy use.


Hokkaido Electric to start direct trading of electricity futures by April

(Jiji News, Jan. 6)
•  The northern power utility will participate directly in electricity futures trading both on the TOCOM
exchange owned by JPX and the European Energy Exchange (EEX) platform in Japan. The
company hopes to start trading on both exchanges by the end of this fiscal year.
•  Hokkaido Electric has sent orders for off-auction TOCOM and EEX futures trading through trading
companies and financial institutions since September 2020. The utility will continue to trade in this

way, but it will also set up its own direct trading on the exchange.
•  CONTEXT: JERA is another Japanese power major expected to start directly trading electricity
futures. Tohoku Electric was the first of Japan’s major power utilities to trade futures contracts. The
majority of the power futures volume is currently on the EEX.



JERA’s focus on fuel switch for thermal power offers Asia third way to decarbonize

(Nikkei Business, Jan. 5)
•  The weekly ran a series of articles tracking the strategy of JERA, Japan’s biggest power company
and top LNG importer; and how JERA persuaded its foreign directors, banks and others that
decarbonization doesn’t need to be done only through renewables.
•  The company’s message is that switching coal-fired power plants in Asia to burn ammonia or
hydrogen, alongside introducing new renewables capacity, is a much more effective and realistic
strategy for the region.
•  A JERA official said: “If you focus solely on renewable energy, like European energy companies,

you may indeed be able to increase your corporate value. However, if you look outside of Europe,
such as in Asia, the reality is that you can't just jump straight to renewable energy. This is where
JERA, as the vanguard of Japan's global energy companies, can contribute, and that’s where we
should aim for new business.”
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JERA and IHI start an ammonia co-firing demonstration project at Hekinan coal station

(Company statement, Jan. 7)
o  JERA and IHI Corporation had a grant application accepted by the Green Innovation
Fund to develop technology that increases ammonia co-firing at coal power plants.
o  JERA and IHI are working on a demonstration project that employs an ammonia co-firing
rate of 20% at JERA’s Hekinan Thermal Power Station Unit 4.

JERA signs accord to establish floating offshore wind firm with two French partners
(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 7)
•  JERA signed a final agreement with two French companies to establish a floating offshore wind
power development company. BW Ideale and a government-owned investment firm, were in talks
with JERA since June 2020.
•  The three will establish a JV in France that will be 51% held by BW IDEOL, and 24.5% each by

JERA and the investment company.
•  The venture will utilize BW Ideol's floating foundation technology and focus on business in the
U.S., UK, France and other European countries; but not Japan.
•  JERA aims to acquire know-how by developing floating offshore wind power projects from an early
stage. It then hopes to apply that knowledge in Japan.

NEWS:     OIL,   GAS   &  MINING






METI to set new rare earth mining licenses and expand JOGMEC functions
(Japan NRG, Dec. 21)
•  METI plans to create a new mining license category for rare earths and expand the role of Japan
Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) to strengthen the supply of metals vital for
decarbonization. This will limit rare earth mining in offshore deposits within Japan’s exclusive
economic zone access to state-approved miners.

•  Japan has the regulatory framework for mining base metals such as copper, zinc, and lead, but not
for rare earths that haven't been mined in Japan.
•  In 2020, a government team prospecting for deposits of rare earth, cobalt and nickel in the seas
south of Tokyo successfully recovered cobalt and nickel, increasing the possibility of recovering
rare earth.
•  JOGMEC’s role, which is tasked to secure energy and metal resources overseas, will be expanded

locally, and it will be more instrumental in enhancing refining capabilities of copper, zinc, lead, and
nickel smelters in Japan, as well as metal recycling.
•  CONTEXT: Currently, JOGMEC’s investment in upstream projects is limited to 50% but this
threshold will be removed to finance high-risk operations. The changes will involve amendments to
the Mining Act and the JOGMEC Act to be proposed to parliament when it convenes later this
month.
• TAKEAWAY: Among the 34 critical mineral resources in the national stockpile, the so-called battery metals —

cobalt, lithium and nickel, and rare earths — are the focus in building stronger supply chains. Copper and rare
earths are priority recycling items.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Battery costs rise as lithium demand outstrips supply

(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 3)
o  Carmakers scramble for raw materials in a bid to win global electric vehicle race.
o  Price of batteries for electric vehicles looks set to rise in 2022 following a decade of sharp
decline as supplies of lithium and other raw materials fail to keep up with ballooning
demand.
o  The increases are undermining the technological and efficiency gains of recent years.

Chinese prices up five-fold in a year.



Japan Asks Indonesia for Immediate Coal Export Ban Removal

(Various, Jan. 5)
•  Japan asked Indonesia to remove a ban on export of high-grade coal as several vessels loaded to
ship the product from the Southeast Asian nation await departure permits.
•  The world’s largest thermal coal exporter banned exports from this year to avoid falling short of
the fuel domestically, causing power outages.

•  Japan argues that the high-caloric coal it buys from Indonesia isn’t used by that country’s power
plants.
•  Japan imports most thermal coal from Australia; about 15% from Indonesia.
•  Given high inventory levels at home, JERA and J-Power, which are Japan’s main buyers of coal for

power generation, aren’t concerned by the ban.
•  Japan has about one month of coal reserves in stocks, but some utilities may choose to utilize
more gas-fired generation if coal reserves start to run low.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan agrees to support Indonesia’s switch from coal to ammonia power generation
(Nikkei, Jan. 10)
o  Japan agreed to supporting Indonesia's efforts to decarbonize through a joint public-

private project to use ammonia, which does not emit CO2 when burned, at coal-fired
power plants in the Southeast Asian nation.
o  METI minister Hagiuda is touring Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore this week. On Jan
10, he signed a MoU with Indonesia to cooperate on a gradual transition to
decarbonization.
o  CONTEXT: Indonesia has set a net-zero emissions target set for 2060.
o  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is one of the Japanese firms embarking on ammonia

generation projects in Indonesia. It will test co-firing at a Suraya coal-fired power plant.
The project will receive financial support from Japan’s public and private sectors.

(Company statement, Dec. 20)
•  Osaka Gas will enter India’s gas distribution business, investing $120 million in a local unit of
Atlantic, Gulf & Pacific International Holdings (AG&P), a Singapore-based infrastructure

development company. The investment will be made with the Japan Overseas Infrastructure
Investment Corporation for Transport & Urban Development.
•  Osaka Gas is already an investor in the parent company, but the latest deal will give it a stake in
the Indian vehicle that AG&P set up after it won licenses to operate in 12 city gas areas in South
India and Rajasthan.
•  AG&P aims to grow Indian gas sales to 3.5 billion m3 a year, which is approximately half of Osaka

Gas’ city gas sales volume in Japan.
•  Osaka Gas is Japan’s first participant in India’ city gas distribution sector.


Oil company CEOs pessimistic about gasoline demand

(NHK, Dec 27)
•  The CEOs of Japan’s big three oil companies described an unprecedented sense of crisis over
falling demand for petrochemical products.
•  Describing the shift away from carbon as irreversible, ENEOS boss Ota Katsuyuki says there’s an
increasing risk that demand for petrochemicals will decline faster than expected. Lower demand
could cause oil producing nations to reduce supply, thereby causing oil prices to skyrocket.

•  COSMO CEO Kiriyama Hiroshi echoed this, saying that as Japan is currently reliant on fossil fuels
for over 80% of its primary energy needs, imposing sudden restrictions on fossil fuels will cause
prices to rise.
•  Idemitsu CEO Kito Shun’ichi said that while divestment from fossil fuels can boost renewables
growth, power shortages may result if done too quickly.



Further restructuring unavoidable in petrochemical sector

(Asahi Shimbun, Jan. 2)
•  2021 saw a record number of mergers and acquisitions in Japan’s petrochemical sector, reflecting
the global trend to divest from fossil fuels.
•  Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings aims to spin off its petrochemical and carbon-products businesses
by 2023.
•  These businesses supply the raw materials for making plastics and steel, both of which are part of
Mitsubishi Chemical’s core business.
•  Its Okayama and Ibaraki plants make 730,000 metric tons of ethylene annually, but major

investment is needed to reduce their carbon footprints.
•  CEO Jean-Marc Gilson said further consolidation and restructuring in the Japanese market is
unavoidable.



Toho Gas to supply carbon free gas to KIOXIA
(Denki Shimbun, Dec. 24)
•  Toho Gas agreed with 10 companies, including Kioxia, to supply carbon-neutral city gas that offers
carbon offset credits along with the gas itself. The total supply of gas during the contract period is
expected to be about 30 million m3.

•  The 10 companies will contribute to a reduction of about 80,000 tons of CO2.
•  The deal brings the number of carbon neutral clients of Toho Gas to 26.
•  Toho Gas will use 25,000 tons of carbon-neutral LNG to supply city gas to the 10 companies. Toho
Gas is sourcing the LNG mostly from Sakhalin Energy.



Asian LNG prices plunge 30% as Europe supply worries ease

(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 6)
•  Asian spot prices for LNG dropped by 30% in a span of a week, with Chinese and Japanese
inventory pressures easing after a similar plunge in Europe.
•  The weekly LNG spot price for the Asia region stood at $33.80 per mbtu around the start of the
year, down from the record $48.30 logged on Dec. 23.
•  Chinese and Japanese inventories slacken, but remain at elevated levels.

ANALYSIS


BY TOMAS KÅBERGER

The Future Belongs to Renewables, but

Japan’s Policies Continue to Buck Global Trends

Many felt disappointed by the outcomes of the United Nations Climate Change
Conference (COP26) held last November in Glasgow. To me, the conference and
2021 as a whole only reinforced the strength of the decarbonization movement and
the shift to renewables. The optimism of the COP26 meeting exceeded that of any
previous COP summit.

There are several important trends to note from last year:

•  The cost of renewables has dropped to the point where renewable electricity is
economically attractive as a replacement for fossil fuels
•  Business is welcoming the climate-neutral environment and several industry groups
have presented joint plans to reduce emissions by shifting away from hydrocarbons to
renewable energy sources in their supply chains
•  Policies that set a price on CO2 emissions are spreading around the world and ideas
such as the EU’s Climate Board-Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are proving popular
as a way to ensure the competitiveness of industry in a net-zero-emissions
environment

Let’s look at some numbers behind these trends.

In 2020, the International Energy Agency (IEA) called solar electricity the cheapest in
history. In 2021, Saudi Arabia achieved a new record low when electricity from a solar
farm was offered at only $0.0104/ kWh (about ¥1.16/ kWh). Even if countries in
Europe, North America and Northeast Asia, where solar radiation is only half as
intense as in Saudi Arabia and costs are double as a result, the price is still low
enough to start outcompeting thermal power plants.

Not only solar has become cheap. Investments in wind generation have brought down
costs to the point where onshore and offshore projects in Europe can compete
without subsidies. Costs are around ¥3 to ¥4 per kWh and could fall further.

The most important achievement of renewable electricity is that its total cost now runs
below the price of energy contained in crude oil. Renewable electricity is often
cheaper per unit of energy than natural gas and, sometimes, can be a more profitable
substitute to coal in industrial use. Thus, we can conclude that even without subsidies
and taxes, electricity from renewable sources can start to replace fossil fuel systems.
We already see this happening in the transport sector and, increasingly, in
manufacturing.


Transport and Industry
For electricity to replace fuels, we inevitably need batteries or power to be stored in
hydrogen or liquid fuels. The market share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is in the

|  | For electricity to replace fuels, we inevitably need batteries or power to be stored in |
|  | hydrogen or liquid fuels. The market share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is in the |

double-digits in several countries already; it is approaching 100% in Norway, which
has also employed wind and hydro power to generate nearly all of its electricity.

Steel is often given as an example of a product that’s impossible to make without
fossil fuels. In June 2021, Sweden’s Hybrit delivered the first sponge iron made from
iron ore with electricity that came from renewable sources. In the ironmaking process,
Hybrit (a joint venture of SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall) replaced coal with green
hydrogen. In August, SSAB had converted that sponge iron into steel, and in October,
Volvo had used that steel to build a vehicle.

These advances in batteries and hydrogen systems make the task of replacing fossil
fuels in power generation easier. Car batteries and hydrogen are examples of energy
storage that could be topped up during times when renewable energy generation is
abundant and cheap. In the hours of the day when the sun is not shining or the wind is
blowing less, batteries aren’t charged and hydrogen is not produced. So, vehicles and
industries operate with the energy stored. This basic concept makes it easier to phase
out fossil fuels as a whole rather than just replacing them in the power sector.


COP26 and Carbon Pricing
At the COP26 summit a Coalition of First Movers and other industrial initiatives
committed to go ahead and, in various ways, demand CO2-free supply chains from
their vendors. They did this to prove their social responsibility and because they saw
an opportunity to gain competitiveness as renewable energy becomes cheaper. But
they also did this to reduce the risks for investors during the shift to new technologies.

In July 2021, the EU Commission adopted a proposal for a new Carbon Border
Adjustment Mechanism that will put a carbon price on imported products. This is
done to avoid putting first movers in decarbonization and adopters of carbon pricing
at a competitive disadvantage.

Carbon pricing now exists in an increasing number of countries and this kind of
mechanism will make it more difficult for others to continue with their fossil fuel
systems, even if they are still cost-competitive domestically with renewable
alternatives.


Japan’s Implausible Gambit
Japanese industry was once a leader in developing solar PV technologies. Japanese
firms have been providing batteries for customers all over the world, and the country
was where the idea of hydrogen as an energy carrier evolved.

Today, however, the political leadership in Tokyo seems lost when it comes to
deciphering the global developments as described above.

Newly elected Prime Minister Kishida delivered a speech at COP26 that won yet
another “Fossil of the Day” award from the Climate Action Network. The reason: His
economically implausible idea that it’s fine to build more thermal power plants,
because at some point in the future they can be fueled by imported hydrogen or
ammonia, both of which could also be derived from fossil fuels while being offset with
carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions. The premise seems
dead from the start. When electricity from renewables is cheaper than from thermal

In Japan, the cost of renewable power is coming down thanks to a build-up of
industrial experience and the efforts of hundreds of companies.

If Japanese manufacturing is to stay cost-competitive on a global basis, the
government has to remove administrative barriers to renewables and truly open up
the power grid and the power market to new, progressive actors.

Deliberately wedding Japan to future imports of coal, LNG, uranium and expensive
hydrogen or ammonia instead of utilizing cheap domestic renewable resources seems
like a recipe for economic demise.

Such a policy seems to be diametrically opposite to the atmosphere of technological
and economic progress that we saw at COP26.

HIROYUKI TEZUKA

Rushing the Green Agenda Will Backfire!
Japan Embraces Energy Pragmatism

The message regularly put out by most developed western nations in 2021 was that
the world must move towards a green energy transition at all costs. The economic
reality, however, showed us that it cannot happen at any cost. If climate change is to
be tackled in a truly global fashion, the solutions and processes cannot ignore current
and future global needs. In this sense, the COP26 summit in November was a perfect
example of how the message is starting to run away from the context.

We are not pessimistic about the challenge of carbon neutrality. Yet, as with all
problems, we must be candid about the current situation and set realistic targets. We
should also acknowledge that decarbonization will be an expensive and long-term
process that much of the developing world cannot currently afford. Forcing a rushed
climate agenda would likely backfire and there is already evidence for that.


Global Policy Rushes to Cancel Coal
The UK, EU and the U.S. have expedited the climate agenda in the last year, which
has yielded more results than many realize. In the summer, as host of the G7, the UK
succeeded in cementing the idea that global average temperatures should be
restrained to an increase of 1.5°C. This was included in a G7 Summit Communiqué for
the first time. Other firsts included a net-zero-emissions target by 2050 and an
agreement to move away from “unabated” coal-fired generation. Calls by Western
nations for G7 members to halt financing for coal projects abroad were also heeded.

The UK planned to have similar messages reflected in the G20 Leaders’ Declaration,
yet its ideas were met with strong opposition from China, India, Saudi Arabia, Russia,
and other countries. In the end, the G20 summit only reconfirmed the temperature
targets of the Paris Agreement. The G20 did not agree to phase out domestic coal-
fired capacity.

Despite the resistance at the G20, the UK pushed through the more ambitious targets
at COP26 in November. The Glasgow Climate Pact adopted at COP26 includes:

•  A resolution to pursue efforts to limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C;
•  Recognition that limiting this rise in temperatures requires a 45% cut in global
emissions by 2030 (compared with 2010 levels) and to reach net zero by mid-century;
•  Calling for COP27 to adopt a working plan to scale up ambitions during the “critical
decade” leading to 2030; and
•  Request the parties to strengthen their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as
necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022.

Most importantly, the Glasgow agreement includes the wording: "to accelerate
the…phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel
subsidies…" While toned down from the originally proposed “phase out,” this is the
first time that such wording targeted a specific energy source.

The Cost of Expediting Net Zero
The proactive approach of the UK and like-minded western politicians has significantly
altered the nature of the Paris Agreement, part of the appeal of which was its delicate
balance between a top-down approach of setting global temperature targets and a
bottom-up approach through which each country could set targets based on its own
specific circumstances.

What does that mean in practice? By aiming for a 45% cut by 2030 and net zero by
2050 all around the world – at once – the scene is set for a fierce battle between the
developed and developing nations over a limited carbon budget. It’s no wonder that
India asked rich nations for $1 trillion in annual contributions. That’s the cost of
expediting decades of development in the weaker economies while at the same time
raising the NDCs.

Now that “coal phaseout” is officially accepted, the next global policy war will focus
on the date by which this must be completed. The debate could well expand to
setting similar dates for other fossil fuels. At COP26, we already saw over 40 countries,
including the U.S. and EU, issue a joint declaration to end public financing for the
entire fossil fuel sector. But such messages are disconnected from energy reality.

The ongoing energy crisis in the UK, parts of Europe and elsewhere is to a large
extent caused by the supply-demand imbalance in fossil fuels that resulted from
stagnant upstream oil and gas investment. So, while green policies call for an end to
fossil fuels and claim that GHG cuts are the utmost priority, the top item on the daily
agenda of many governments is cooling record high energy prices.

It seems clear that when there’s a risk to secure and affordable energy supply, which is
the fundamental policy requirement, then the climate agenda can easily be set aside.


Why Japan is Not Rushing into Renewables at Full Speed
Last April, former Prime Minister Suga declared that Japan will cut GHG emissions
46% by FY2030, compared to the FY2013 level. It was a highly ambitious target since
85% of Japan’s energy currently comes from fossil fuels.

Between 2013 and 2018, Japan reduced CO2 emission 12%. How? Japan restarted
nine nuclear reactors, which contributed 2.4 percentage points. The rollout of
renewable energy, mostly solar that was supported by a Feed-In Tariff (FIT), offered
the same. In total, nuclear restarts and renewables offered a 5% reduction in
emissions. But the 2030 target requires Japan to cut another 38% from the 2018 level.

The good news is that Japan still has 18 reactors waiting for a restart. As well as
cutting emissions, nuclear plants can suppress the increase in electricity cost caused
by building more solar and other renewables through the FIT tariffs — the nation’s
expenses on FIT jumped to ¥2.4 trillion, or ￥2.9/ kWh in 2018. That number inched
up to ¥2.7 trillion in 2021 and if the share of renewables doubles over the next
decade, as per the instruction from the new Basic Energy Plan, then the FIT number
will swell to about ¥4.7 trillion.

Even at 2018 levels, the FIT surcharge translates into a carbon price of around $70/
ton of CO2. It could get much worse economically since the restart of reactors in
Japan is currently a highly political and unpredictable process.

There are other constraints to renewables in Japan. The country already has the
highest solar-panel cover density among major countries; twice the density of
Germany when comparing flat land surfaces. This is one of the reasons for many local
issues that plague the development of solar power and the growing local resistance to
new projects.

Onshore wind farms face the same space issues, while offshore the relatively deeper
ocean floor and 30% lower wind flow, compared with the North Sea in Europe, leads
to cost disadvantages for Japan.

The cost of energy, electricity in particular, impacts competitiveness for Japan’s
industry, which produces globally traded, energy-intensive products. According to a
study by European think-tanks1, Japan’s electricity cost for industry was among the
highest in 2015. It is three times more expensive than the U.S. and Canada and almost
double that of China and Korea. The study also revealed that the electricity cost in
Germany was significantly reduced to the levels of France, where cheap nuclear is a
major source of electricity, by exempting most of the policy charges such as EEG (the
equivalent of FIT in Japan) and tax levies.

Therefore, we can suppose that high energy costs are one of the reasons for stagnant
wages in Japan.

As things stand, Japan’s commitment to doubling its
renewables quota to 36-38% of the energy mix by
2030 will inevitably push up the cost of electricity.
Asking for an even higher percentage, with the
current technologies and conditions, creates the risk
of backfiring in the same way that developing
nations pushed back against the G7 agenda in 2021.

What Japan needs most is a strategic industrial
energy policy that looks to ensure global
competitiveness for its industry, while also improving
the environmental footprint. Ignoring the former to
pursue the latter eliminates the vital connection
between climate and the economy.

GLOBAL       OUTLOOK         2022

B Y JOHN VAROLI

In the Chinese tradition, 2022 is the Year of the Tiger. How fitting, because the global energy sector
seems set to roar, especially in China whose economy grew 8% in 2021 and electricity consumption at
10%. The country is making large investments in renewable energy, as well as in nuclear power and the
reactivation of coal-fired plants.

As demand increases, critical energy shortages are pushing many nations to put climate promises on hold.
Greta Thunberg will be disappointed in 2022 — fossil fuels and nuclear power will enjoy a good year, if
not a good several years. Fossil fuels and renewables will have to coexist and cooperate longer than
environmentalists had hoped for.

Covid, of course, is the big unknown that could throw a wrench into the machinery of the global economy.
However, pandemic fatigue is reaching a critical point, and governments will be pressured to invigorate
the global economy rather than shut it down again.

Let’s take a look at each major energy sector and its prospects for 2022.

Nuclear
Since the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, nuclear power’s future has been bleak.
But much has changed in the past six months. Many countries signed up to ambitious
climate goals, and that’s unlikely to happen without carbon-free nuclear power. While
Germany closed three of its remaining six nuclear plants on Dec 31, 2021, about half a
dozen EU countries plan to build new reactors. The U.S. is also supportive of nuclear
power to meet net-zero goals, while China’s nuclear program beguiles the mind — to
build 150 reactors in the next 15 years. For its part, Japan is developing SMRs, most
notably a GE-Hitachi project in Canada, and a $5 billion nuclear reactor with
TerraPower in the U.S.

Oil
It’s going to be a good year for fossil fuels. As people get back on the road, oil
demand will remain robust. The price of oil is a key indicator of national happiness in
the U.S. and will impact the midterm elections in November. Thus, the Biden
administration will do its best to keep oil prices stable. He’ll have to call on favors
from OPEC countries and also make concessions to Big Oil at home. Oil prices are
expected to stay within a range of $65 to $80 per barrel. What the oil companies do
with those profits, however, will be a contentious issue. Will they invest in new fossil-
fuel projects or finance the green energy transition?

LNG/ Gas
Likewise, LNG and natural gas will see another good year. Prices will remain high but
likely stable. While natural gas faces condemnation from environmentalists, the
European Union plans to classify some gas-fired plants as "transitional” under certain
strict conditions. This is crucial for the EU’s leading economy, Germany, which more
than ever is heavily dependent on gas. In general, about 25% of the EU’s total energy
currently comes from gas, and replacing that capacity with renewable energy will take
a decade or more. In Asia, countries such as South Korea are switching coal-fired
power plants to gas. East Asian demand for LNG will grow this year and beyond.

Coal
Even though the U.S. and many West European countries are shutting their coal-fired
power plants, global coal demand will hit another high this year — reaching 8,025 Mt
in 2022, the highest ever. China and India will lead consumption growth, which will
more than outpace the declines in other markets. Motivated by the need to power its
industry, China is ignoring climate change impact for now and reigniting many of its
coal-fired plants. Regarding coal, Japan is closer to China and India than Europe, but
Tokyo vows to push on with developing co-firing generation that should see thermal
plants also run on ammonia as well as coal to cut total emissions. In addition, China
and Japan are planning to launch a!"clean-coal” technology pilot project in China#s
Shaanxi province.

Hydrogen
Despite setbacks to meeting net-zero targets as described above, the clean energy
sector will continue to grow in giant leaps and bounds in 2022, especially in the
hydrogen space. For example, Australia is fast-tracking the $10 billion, 10-GW Desert
Bloom green hydrogen project that will use solar and wind. Economies of scale and
improved technology have lowered the cost of hydrogen fuel cells by 60% over the
past decade. What more, green hydrogen, which relies on renewables such as solar
and wind, seems to be one of the few energy sources that makes everyone happy —
from environmentalists to giant legacy energy companies eager to enhance their
environmental credentials.

Solar
Solar will continue to shine in 2022, with an estimated 44 GW coming online globally,
nearly double 2021′s projected 23 GW, according to S&P. This increase in solar
capacity is driven by the expansion of state-mandated renewable requirements and
more tax credits. Energy storage is key for intermittent power sources like solar and
S&P expects 8 GW of storage to be installed in 2022, around 600% more than in
2020. But there are bumps on the road to this bright future. Rystad Energy says that
more than half of 2022′s global solar infrastructure projects will be hindered by rising
raw material costs and supply chain woes. This means that 56% of an anticipated 90
GW of new utility-scale solar projects could face delays or be canceled.

Wind
New installed wind turbine capacity in 2022 will easily surpass the annual record of 16
GW set in 2020 and could be as much as double that number. This year, the UK will
complete the world’s largest offshore wind farm — the 165 turbines of Hornsea Two,
(8.4 MW each). The IEA believes that offshore wind has the potential to power all of
global demand. Meanwhile, wind farms are bigger than ever. Four years ago, wind
farms typically utilized 7- and 8-MW turbines with 70- to 90-meter-long blades. Soon,
market leader Vesta plans to start selling 15-MW turbines with 115-meter-long blades.

Geothermal
While a niche, the global geothermal electricity market is expected to grow about 9%,
from $5.5 billion in 2021 to $6 billion in 2022. The World Bank will loan Turkey $300
million to support its Geothermal Development Project to build 380 MW of capacity
by tapping heat sources deep in the ground. There’s strong enthusiasm for more
geothermal energy in Japan and Southeast Asia, as well as parts of Africa, though the
technology’s application is of course limited by location and its complexity. One
project in the U.S. is already bogged down in lawsuits. Last week, conservationists and

tribal leaders sued the U.S. government to block construction of two geothermal
plants in Nevada#s high desert that they say will destroy a sacred hot spring.

Biomass
The global biomass energy market will remain marginal but its value is forecasted to
grow 10%, from $33.6 billion in 2021 to $37 billion in 2022. At the end of December,
the UK government pledged £26 million to boost the use of materials such as grasses,
hemp and seaweed as green energy solutions. One drawback with biomass fuels is
that they can’t easily be scaled. Meeting demand for low-carbon aviation fuel offers
much potential, but meeting that demand is problematic. For example, only about
26.4 million gallons of low-emission, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is produced
annually, which is a fraction of the 18 billion gallons of fuel burned by U.S. carriers
alone.

Green Finance
Sustainable finance, also known as green finance, will accelerate in 2022. Bloomberg
predicts that this year about $2.5 trillion of green and ESG-oriented debt will be
issued, up from $1.5 trillion in 2021. For the first time since the Paris Climate Accord in
2015, financial institutions are earning more fees from green-related bond sales and
loans, a total of $3.4 billion last year; which slightly surpasses what they earned raising
money for fossil-fuel companies: $3.3 billion. In 2020, those figures were $1.9 billion
for green deals, and $3.7 billion for fossil fuel deals.

JAPAN     OUTLOOK        2022


IEEJ Energy Forecasts for Japan for 2022: Zero-Emissions Power
Sources Exceed 30% for the first time since 2011 and Household
Energy Expenditures to hit $130 billion


The Institute of Energy Economics in Japan (‘IEEJ’) has released their domestic energy
forecasts for FY2022. With the kind permission of the IEEJ, we’re providing a summary
below.

The IEEJ is Japan’s leading non-profit energy think-tank with over 100 member firms.
In 2020 the University of Pennsylvania ranked the IEEJ as a top three energy and
resource policy think-tank in the world.


Japan Energy and Economic Forecasts for 2022

•  Real GDP will hit a record high of ¥558 trillion in FY2022 (FY2019 was ¥551 trillion)

•  Total energy consumption will be 429 million toe in FY2022 compared with 445 mtoe

in FY2019, the pre-pandemic year, a decrease of 4%











•  Household energy expenditures are expected to be ¥14.9 trillion (almost $130 billion)
in FY2022, up 4% YoY and up 6% vs. FY2019, with most of the increase coming from
electricity charges

•  Two additional nuclear reactors will restart in FY2022, bringing the total number of
units restarted to 12 since the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011

•  Electricity prices will rise for the second successive year due to high renewable
surcharges and higher fuel imports with prices for electricity for lighting hitting ¥29.7
(26 U.S. cents)/ kWh compared with ¥27.3/ kWh in FY2019

•  Coal and oil consumption will marginally increase






28


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• CO2 emissions will increase for the second successive
year, which means only half of the 46% emissions cut (vs.
FY2013) by 2030 will have been achieved; C02 emissions
in FY2022 are expected to be 20% lower than in FY2013,
the reference year; 75% of the reductions since FY2013
are now attributable to energy efficiencies and lower
energy consumption per unit of GDP

• Sales of electricity are expected to increase to 840
TWh, up 1% YoY, and higher than FY2019 (836 TWh), but
lower than FY2018 (853 TWh), due to business demand

• Zero-emission power generation (renewables and
nuclear) in FY2021 exceeded 30% of total generation for the first time since 2011; the
trend will continue in FY2022

•  Power generation from LNG will fall by 6% vs. FY2019

•  Power generation from hydro will fall marginally YoY
















•  Total city sales of natural gas will increase marginally to 42 bcm vs. 41 bcm in FY2021

with sales to industry and commercial firms increasing, and residential sales flat
•  Fuel oil sales in Japan will continue their decline and are expected to fall 1% YoY to

153 billion liters, with sales of naphtha contributing most of the decline




We are deeply grateful to Mr. Toshiyuki Sakamoto, Board Member, IEEJ and Mr. Ryo
Eto, Senior Economist, for giving us permission to reprint these forecasts.
