Japan to reopen borders partially from today, Nov. 8

(Various, Nov. 7)
•  The government said it will ease restrictions on entry of foreign nationals into Japan from Nov. 8,
Monday. However, the opening of the borders, at this time, only applies for business people and
students, not to tourists or leisure travel.
•  The new rules will cut the mandatory quarantine period to three days from 10-14 for those who are
fully vaccinated with shots approved by the Japanese government.
•  The receiving parties in Japan will need to take steps to make sure business visitors and students

follow protocol for infection prevention.
•  CONTEXT: Japan tightening its borders in January in response to the spread of new Covid-19
variants. The number of local transmissions has dropped severely in recent months.



Grid oversight body to establish new division for renewables and international coordination

(Japan NRG, Nov. 2)
•  In February 2022, the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators
(OCCTO), the power grid oversight body, will launch a new division for renewables and
international coordination, according to an update from the electricity and gas policy panel.
•  This will come two months ahead of the launch of the feed-in-premium (FIP) system. With the FIP
launch, collection and distribution of tariff fees under the FIP and the Feed-In Tariff systems will
move to OCCTO from the Green Investment Promotion Organization.
•  The international office will integrate into the renewable division.

•  OCCTO, which oversees nationwide power transmission network operations, will also have
expanded roles to write rules that ensure fair access to the grid.
•  It will also form new approaches to oversee national power supply and demand after the launch of
the capacity market in 2024.
•  CONTEXT: Similar to the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) that sets
guidelines and monitors power to wholesalers and retailers, OCCTO needs to be independent

from METI and the regional grids in order to be held accountable by independent renewable
operators. To date, OCCTO has relied on regional grids for staffing but it will now increase own
recruitment. At the same time, OCCTO seeks to relax rules for its senior officials to allow them to
join grid companies after retirement from its posts, something that’s currently banned.



METI and MLIT start review of low-emission housing and building standards

(Japan NRG, Nov. 4)
•  METI and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism started a review of low-
emission housing and building standards. The review was launched to meet the 2030 goal to cut
national emissions by 46% from 2013 levels.
•  The new goal will require homes and buildings to reduce energy consumption equivalent to 8.9
million KL of oil. Japan needs overall cuts of 62.4 million KL.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  To date, 53,561 structures, mostly stand-alone homes, have cleared the standards and enjoyed tax
breaks and subsidies. They make use of heat insulator materials and have energy saving features.
•  The new standards will be more specific to different building purposes. Schools and shopping
malls will have different building energy index levels to target. There will be more elaborate criteria
for the use and recycling of water, installation of solar panels and storage battery systems, the use

of wood and cement that recycle fly ash and slag waste generated from steelmaking.
• TAKEAWAY: As Japan NRG has reported in the Analysis section in previous months, the housing sector will be
one of the biggest contributors to the decarbonization drive over the course of this decade, according to
estimates from government officials.

• Households accounted for 15% of nationwide carbon emissions in 2019. Energy consumption was equivalent
to 47 million KL of crude oil, resulting in 159 million tons of carbon. A household average was 3.97 tons of
carbon. The biggest source of carbon was lighting and other electrical appliances, followed by cars and room
heating systems.

METI offers support to SMEs hit by surging energy costs
(Japan NRG, Nov. 2)
•  METI will offer financial support to small and medium sized enterprises capitalized below ¥100
million that have been hit by surging crude oil prices. METI will provide Safety Net Loans, which
are low-interest loans of 1.06-1.81%, to companies suffering over 5% sales declines in the last

three-months compared to the same period last year or the year before.
•  CONTEXT: Over 40,000 businesses close each year in Japan. A lack of heirs to a family business is
one reason, but the impact of rising energy costs may emerge as another driver. Fostering SME
growth is a METI policy priority amid the shrinking share of Japanese multinationals in global
markets.



Post-2020 biodiversity framework launched in Japan

(Japan NRG, Nov. 5)
•  MoE launched the Japanese chapter of Global Biodiversity Framework -- aiming to preserve 30%
of the earth planet by 2030, a goal set during the COP10 meeting in Aichi in 2010. The

Japanese biomass market to be worth ¥1.7 trillion by 2035

(New Energy Business News, Nov. 1)
•  According to the Yano Research Institute, Japan’s biomass energy market is currently worth ¥726
billion.
•  The Institute projects the market will grow to over ¥1.7 trillion by 2035 as demand for biofuels, in
particular bio jet fuel, increases.
•  HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) biological aviation fuels are already produced

commercially. In future, the commercialization of novel processes, such as the ethanol to jet fuel
process and increased uptake of dry methane fermentation, is likely to further boost bio jet fuel
supply.




EDITORIAL: Japan must aim to make its storage batteries globally competitive
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Nov. 5)
•  CONTEXT: The newspaper is the top media for the manufacturing industry in Japan.
•  Future of Japan’s auto and other manufacturing industries depend on the country improving the
performance and reducing the cost of storage batteries. Strategic efforts must be made to develop
a storage battery industry that can compete on the global stage while securing its R&D and

production in Japan.
•  The government plans to provide up to ¥151 billion in support for next-generation storage
batteries and motors over the next 10 years from the Green Innovation Fund, which has a total of
¥2 trillion in funds.
•  The governments of the U.S., Europe, and China have also announced large-scale support for the
development of storage batteries. In the future, the selection of targets that the government
supports with funding will need to be handled in a manner that clearly identifies areas of

competition and areas of cooperation.
•  Support for the development and mass production of next-generation batteries will be positioned
as an area that emphasizes competition, with emphasis placed on promising technologies and
companies that are willing to invest, rather than on a broad and shallow scope.
•  Japan has a technological advantage in next-generation batteries such as all-solid-state batteries,
but China is rapidly catching up. The government wants to encourage domestic companies to

compete and make the strongest ones stronger.
•  Equally, it is necessary to create business models and rules for securing resources such as rare
metals and for recycling in cooperation with the public and private sectors. Storage batteries are
expected to be used in a wider range of applications than before, which will strain resources.
•  Japan has been slow to take action around raw materials. It plans to recover nickel and cobalt from
used lithium-ion batteries, but not lithium. Most of the Japanese business models for reuse are still
in the demonstration stage.

•  Japanese firms will need to cooperate in order to catch up with global peers in storage batteries.




COP26: Japan proposes trading emissions credits with developing countries
(Yomiuri Shimbun, Oct. 31)
•  Sources say the Japanese delegation to COP26 will propose a novel emissions trading scheme
designed to benefit industrialized countries that provide technological assistance to developing
nations.
•  Under the scheme, industrialized countries would be able to credit a portion of emissions

reductions in partner countries resulting from technological assistance as their own.
•  The idea is opposed by the U.S. and the EU, which say that if industrialized countries can take
credit for emissions reductions elsewhere then that would reduce motivation for them to cut their
own emissions.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has been a major proponent of the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) and believes it is vital
for this kind of bilateral system to be in place in order to meet its own emissions goal for 2030. We expect
Japan’s COP26 negotiators to fight for this item most of all.

• Please see the Analysis section for more details on COP26.



Japan, U.S., China missing from COP coal pledge

(Nikkei, Nov. 5)
•  At COP26 in Glasgow, 46 nations pledged to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2040.
Japan, as well as the U.S., China and India didn’t sign the pledge.
•  Japan is reliant on coal for 30% of its electricity needs. In China this figure is 67%, and in India the
number is 73%. By contrast, in France and Singapore, the figure is just 1%.




PM Kishida’s comments earn another ‘Fossil of the Day’ award
(Asahi Shimbun, Nov. 3)
•  Climate Action Network International awarded its ‘Fossil of the Day’ award to Norway, Japan and
Australia, in criticism of these nations’ climate policy.
•  Japan was included after PM Kishida said Japan would continue to invest in thermal power plants

as part of development aid to poorer Asian countries.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Ditching Japan’s ‘fossil’ label
(Alterna opinion, Nov 5)
o  If Kishida wants to avoid receiving satirical awards for environmentally unfriendly policies,
he should rethink the government’s strategy on ammonia.
o  At COP26, Kishida stressed Japan’s $100 million investment to convert thermal power

stations to run on ammonia, hydrogen and other zero-emission fuels.
o  However, ammonia is only viable as a fuel if blended with coal.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  While ammonia combustion doesn’t generate CO2, the manufacturing of ammonia from
lignite gives off CO2. The high cost of manufacturing ammonia and the need for its
import are also negative in terms of economics and energy self-sufficiency.
o  Despite the fanfare about the ammonia economy, under the government’s 6th basic
energy plan ammonia and hydrogen will only account for 1% of total electricity

generation in 2030.
o  The government should ditch its ammonia strategy, which only risks international
isolation.
• TAKEAWAY: In last week’s report we described the Fossil of the Day context and how Japan is often on the
receiving end of this satirical away. However, it is not usual for the award to receive much local coverage. The
fact that it did this time may indicate growing interest in Japanese media over how Japan is perceived on

climate issues abroad.



Asian Development Bank slaps stringent requirements on energy loans
(Nikkei, Nov. 4)
•  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) revised lending terms for energy projects.
•  Coal-fired plants are already subject to stringent lending restrictions.
•  The ABD requires countries that borrow to finance gas-fired power plants to demonstrate that the
proposed plants are efficient, will perform only a transitional role, will result in GHG reductions,
and will be economically viable.

•  Borrowers are also required to demonstrate that no comparably-priced or cheaper options are
available for reducing their carbon footprint.
•  The new, stricter requirements mean it will take an average of 18 more years before energy
projects pay for themselves.
•  The efficiency requirement is good news for manufacturers like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, whose
newest gas turbine combined cycle plant can achieve efficiencies of up to 64%.
•  The stricter rules will rekindle debate about global inequality. While Japan’s annual per capita

electricity consumption is around 8 MWh, in the Philippines this figure is a mere 1 MWh, meaning
that total per capita emissions are much lower, even when the relative inefficiency of Filipino power
plants is considered.
•  Developing countries don’t want to be lectured by industrialized nations on carbon footprints.




Coca-Cola Japan to halve GHG emissions by 2030
(Kankyo Business, Oct. 29)
•  By 2030, Coca-Cola Japan will reduce net GHG emissions, including at bottling plants, to half of
2015 levels.
•  The company also aims to reduce total GHG emissions across the supply chain by 30% in the same
period.
•  To this end, Coca Cola will be using more renewably generated electricity at its factories and

manufacturing bottles from 100% recycled plastic.

Tokyo Gas develops hydrogen-fired calcining furnace
(Nikkei, Nov. 4)
•  Tokyo Gas Engineering Solutions has developed a hydrogen-fired calcining furnace that produces
virtually no CO2.

•  Calcining furnaces are used in manufacturing battery anodes and automotive components.
•  The furnace can also run on electricity, or a blend of hydrogen and natural gas.
•  While the use of hydrogen faced challenges in terms of temperature control and NOx emissions,
these were overcome by using a heating system provided by Noritake, Tokyo Gas’ partner.




Japanese companies are global leaders in decarbonization tech: Tokyo firm says
(Nikkei; November 5)
•  Tokyo-based data-analysis company astamuse ranks global companies’ decarbonization tech and
patents based on carbon reduction expected by 2050.
•  According to its research, half of the top 10 players are Japanese with Toyota Motor leading the
way thanks to its Fuel Cell Vehicles, hydrogen infrastructure and EVs, and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries at No. 3 dur to CO2-absorbing materials and high-efficiency thermal power generation

equipment.
•  Hitachi and Toshiba are ranked 6th and 7th respectively due to the former’s transmission and power
conductors and the latter’s CO2-absorbing materials and hydroelectric power tech.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toyota ranks last among automakers on environmental action, Greenpeace says
(Jiji News, Nov. 5)

o  Toyota Motor ranked last among 10 major automakers in terms of decarbonization efforts
in a report released by Greenpeace during the COP26 climate summit
o  The ranking was based on the number of vehicles sold worldwide and looks at efforts
made by each company to transition sales away from internal combustion engine vehicles
and actions taken to decarbonize their supply chains, as well as resource sustainability.
• TAKEAWAY: There are many rankings and it’s not always clear how important some of them are. Still, while a
Tokyo-based data company is unlikely to make global waves, Greenpeace is a global brand and its comments

may gain traction with a section of the general consumer. Indeed, the report by Greenpeace was picked by in
mainstream Japanese media, which shows that Toyota and other domestic firms cannot simply ignore them
and bask in the praise of other rankings.
• Toyota has always said that electric vehicles are not a silver bullet for many reasons including the fact that

much of the electricity generated in Japan today comes from burning fossil fuels. Still, after PM Suga’s
government pledged, that Japan will start to consider life-cycle emissions from vehicles the domestic industry
has been very quiet and few details on how that will be achieved have emerged. With GHG emissions
reporting becoming mandatory in the next few years, Japanese auto giants will need to get ahead of this issue
soon to make sure they are not seen as “anti-climate,” which is how Greenpeace describes Toyota.

Japan lender turns to green bonds to meet climate finance demand
(Nikkei Asia, Nov. 2)
•  The Japan Bank for International Cooperation Director-General Sekine Hiroki gives an interview in
which he outlines how the bank plans to work with Southeast Asian countries to help provide green

financing that will shift the region away from coal to CO2-free power sources.
•  The bank plans to begin issuing green bonds to finance renewable energy, clean transportation
and energy-efficient real estate projects overseas, Sekine said.
•  Sekine also said that natural gas as well as renewable energy will be a “realistic plan” for the
region to move away from coal.



One-Dot News:

•  Honda Motor announced the launch of a battery-sharing service for electric three-wheeled cabs

METI calls for more energy conservation efforts
(Japan NRG, Nov. 5)
•  Energy supplies this winter period may be the most critical in the past 10 years amid low power
reserve rates.
• TAKEAWAY: We have written extensively on the issue in previous editions and this report (link in headline)
does not contain a lot of completely new material, but it is interesting to note that METI continues to provide

updates in the same alarming tone. It’s more likely to be aimed at keeping the market participants on their
tones than to enact real change with most LNG, coal and oil purchases for the next three months or more
already secured by the major domestic utilities.



UK’s SSE invests $208 million in Pacifico unit to enter Japanese wind market
(Nikkei, Nov. 1)
•  UK’s SSE is entering the Japanese offshore wind market. Through its subsidiary SSE Renewables,
SSE has acquired 80% of an offshore wind company affiliated with Japanese renewable energy
developer Pacifico Energy for $208 million (about ¥23.7 billion).
•  The development of offshore wind power generation in Japan is expected to develop quickly and

this makes the market attractive to SSE.
•  Pacifico Energy has been conducting surveys and other activities with the aim of constructing an

Mineral oligopoly overshadows world's drive to decarbonization
(Asia Nikkei, Nov. 4)
•  Concerns are mounting in Japan over its access to materials considered key in the push toward
decarbonization, with most production of mineral resources such as lithium and cobalt

concentrated in just a handful of countries.
•  Any threat to supplies of metals used to churn out everything from batteries for electric vehicles to
electricity poles could stall the drive for a greener society in Japan and other places such as
Europe and the U.S.

•  G3 Holdings Corp. will start an urban mining business this month to recover rare metal resources
from waste circuit boards. Urban mines are defined as industrial products accumulated on the
ground that are regarded as resources, and are positioned as one of the terrestrial resources.
•  The company emphasizes that the recovery of rare metals from discarded circuit boards is a part of
environmental conservation and is highly significant in Japan, where natural resources are scarce.

•  Unlike conventional methods of processing waste substrates such as pulverization and
carbonization, the technology adopted by G3 for its urban mining business uses a "reactive
liberation method" that reduces the amount of metal scattered by pulverization to an absolute
minimum, improves the recovery rate of rare metals, and emits less than one-thirtieth the amount
of CO2 compared to conventional methods.
•  G3 wants to develop a business recovering and selling rare metals such as gold, silver, and copper.
•  With the CO2 it produces, G3 wants to cultivate microalgae.

•  CONTEXT: G3 is a relatively small renewables firms but it is a listed company. Among others
things it runs solar farm operations and maintenance. It is led by Kasahara Hirokazu, a qualified
clinical laboratory technician.

ANALYSIS

BY JOHN VAROLI


SPECIAL REPORT:
THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 1 OF COP26 AND JAPAN IMPACT

Given the unprecedented attention on the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of
the Parties (COP26), and its outsized impact on Japan and others, we are dedicating
this week’s Analysis section entirely to the gathering in Glasgow.

Below are seven significant items or decisions from the opening week of COP26. We
add the potential impact each one may have on Japan.

Over the course of the second week of COP26, we expect the pace of declarations to
slow, although the very biggest agreements are expected either at the very end or in
the days immediately after the event.


Context and public reception
Whatever your views on the matter, COP26 has definitively shown that climate
change is no longer a niche topic. Once the dominion of scientists and left-wing
crusaders, climate change now occupies center stage as the most important political,
social, scientific, financial and economic issue in the world today. It may not be every
person’s No. 1, but on a global level there seems to be no bigger concern.

COP26 also demonstrated how many different interpretations now exist about what
constitutes climate change and the clashing time periods involved. Present-day needs
sat uneasy alongside long-term plans, contrasting expectations and perceived
realities. During the event, India announced possibly the most distant national net-
zero target yet in pledging to decarbonize by 2070.

A less favorable contrast emerged between content and public perception. Hundreds
of world leaders and CEOs descended on Glasgow in private jets. The tabloids, as
well as major business media, had a field day with headlines such as: “Hypocrite
airways? Jeff Bezos's £48m Gulf Stream leads parade of 400 private jets to COP26”,
blared the U.K.’s populist Daily Mail.

GHG emissions of private jets are a small fraction of the total emitted each year, but
many media chastised the elite for forgetting the power of personal example when it
comes to consumption and one’s carbon footprint.

President Joe Biden, as expected, drew probably the biggest attention, but initially
for the wrong reasons as pictures emerged of him dozing off during the summit.
Casting off the jetlag, Biden went on to make some passionate speeches, including a
rebuke for his peers from China and Russia for not attending. He ended his visit by
saying: “I can’t think of two days where more has been accomplished dealing with
climate than these past two days.” China later responded by saying its “concrete actions”
speak louder than “empty words.”

Outside the COP26 venues, tens of thousands of activists poured into the streets of

Glasgow to complain that not enough was being done to protect the climate. Greta
Thunberg was the most prominently featured voice of the activists, labeling the entire
event a “failure” and a publicity exercise. Even before COP26 started she had labeled
government and corporate actions as the equivalent of “blah, blah, blah” – slow,
hypocritical, and tantamount to greenwashing.


COP26 Highlights

1)Japan pledges an additional $10 billion in climate financing
Prime Minister Kishida promised $10 billion more in climate financing over the next
five years on top of the $60 billion in public and private financing that has already
been pledged to showcase how Japan will play a leading role in Asia to combat
climate change. The PM said that this would "include our contribution to the launch of
an innovative financial facility for climate, as we partner with the Asian Development
Bank and others to support the decarbonization of Asia and beyond."

Also, Japan will double foreign assistance to about $15 billion in order to help other
countries adapt to the deleterious effects of climate change.

In another example of climate financing, Kishida said that Japan’s Green Innovation
Fund, which has about $17.6 billion in resources, would be used to develop next-
generation batteries and motors, as well as hydrogen and synthetic fuels to accelerate
the transition to clean energy. “Japan plans to stand at the center of Asia, introducing
renewable energy as much as possible in Asia,” said Kishida. “We plan to support the
transition to clean and renewable energy, to make a carbon-free society.”


2)Pledge to cut methane emissions
The number of countries agreeing to a 30% cut in global methane emissions by 2030
has surpassed 90, and COP26 plans to grow that number during its final week. First
announced in September, the Global Methane Pledge still needs Brazil, China, India
and Russia to get on board. Brazil is expected to join, and much pressure is being
exerted behind the scenes to get China, India and Russia to sign. Japan, one of the
world’s top two LNG markets, joined the pledge in mid October.

Methane accounts for nearly 25% of all heat trapped in the atmosphere in the past
two centuries. However, since methane breaks down quicker, combating it is
considered ‘low-lying fruit’ in the sense that action taken today can do much to limit
projected global warming. The problem for Japan is that the majority of its attributed
methane emissions come from farming and animal husbandry. Coincidentally or not,
Japan’s ministry of agriculture also published a new climate action plan last week,
which detailed plans to reduce methane in rice paddies through water draining
techniques and discussing research into alternative feeds for cattle that could lead to
lower emissions.


3)Pledge to end deforestation
About 100 leaders from countries accounting for 85% of the world’s forests pledged
almost $20 billion of public and private funds to end and reverse deforestation
globally by 2030. Approximately 50% of the planet’s forests have been cut down.
Importantly, one of the signers of the pledge is Brazil, which has long faced

| Importantly, one of the signers of the pledge is Brazil, which has long faced |

international criticism over forest management in the Amazon region. As host nation
for COP26, the UK also pledged $2 billion. Other major forestry countries behind the
pledge include Canada, China, Congo, Indonesia, Russia, and the U.S.

As a major importer of timber from China, Southeast Asia, and South America, Japan
vowed to do more to address how its consumption impacts those nations. At COP26,
PM Kishida pledged about $240 million in aid for global forestry conservation.


4)India will expand in renewable energy
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India would be net-zero by 2070, two decades
after most countries and 10 years after China and Saudi Arabia. Still, Modi also said
India is committed to the energy transition in the short term and would build 500 GW
of renewable capacity to power half of the country’s demand by 2030. Weaning India
off coal, which provides most of its electricity, will be a major challenge. Currently,
India’s renewable energy capacity is at about 100 GW; so, the country would need to
add another 400 GW by 2030. Of this target, Indian officials said 280 GW would come
from solar, 140 GW from wind, and the remaining from hybrid energy sources.

PM Kishida’s announcement about Japan’s focus on helping Asia to transition to clean
energy certainly bodes well for energy cooperation with India, and the two countries
are already starting to cooperate on a wide range of areas from LNG infrastructure
development to storage batteries and hydrogen. Japanese firms see India’s clean
energy revolution as a major business opportunity.


5)Coal’s time is ending
The UK said 190 nations and organizations vowed to end the use of coal, which is the
single biggest contributor to climate change. Among these are major coal users
including Poland, Vietnam and Chile. The headline, however, suggests more than the
pledge details. In principle, the signatories agreed to phase out coal power
generation in the 2030s for major economies and in the 2040s for poorer nations. Yet
some countries like Indonesia were able to secure opt-outs from certain clauses, which
allows them to continue to build new unabated coal-fired power plants. Others like
Poland signed up but plan to stick to their original timeline to phaseout coal, which in
Poland’s case is the late 2040s.

Some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including Australia, India,
China and the U.S., have yet to sign the pledge. Furthermore, an estimated 243 GW
of coal capacity remains in the planning or construction phase in developing
economies, which say they need financing and alternatives before such plans can be
abandoned. How much impact this pledge will have therefore remains to be seen.

Japan is one of those countries that has a complicated relationship with coal. So far,
Japan has agreed to stop financing unabated coal-fired generation abroad but knows
that without credible local alternatives this will mean little. PM Kishida said that his
government plans to promote Japanese clean tech across Asia, noting that his can
include co-firing of ammonia with coal in thermal power plants to reduce emissions.
He also touted the role of the Asia Energy Transition Initiative. "Converting existing
thermal power to zero-emission power generation is necessary" to stabilize volatile
electricity supply that often accompanies renewable energy, Kishida said at COP26.

6) African countries want aid promises to be kept
About two dozen African leaders pressed wealthier nations to make good on pledges
to help the continent to combat climate change. “We want to know if the promises
made will be kept,” said Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development
Bank, referring to pledges of $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing
countries that were made during UN climate talks in 2009.

While Africa is responsible for only about 3% of global GHG emissions, it’s highly
vulnerable to global warming. For example, Madagascar now faces one of the modern
world’s first climate change-induced famines. For their part, some African nations have
joined wealthy industrial nations by making their own GHG emissions pledges. For
example, Nigeria, Africa’s largest crude oil producer, pledged to reach net zero by
2060.

Japan has historically been one of the top donors and investors in Africa until the
more recent arrival of Chinese interests. In certain energy areas, such as geothermal
generation and LNG, Japan will likely stay involved. However, PM Kishida’s comments
suggest that Africa may play a lesser role for his government than for one of his
predecessors, Abe Shinzo. Tokyo will "lead the way in the clean energy transition,
with a particular focus on Asia,” Kishida said.


7) The world of finance takes up arms against climate change
Comments by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen are revealing: “It is not
common for finance ministers to attend COP. In fact I am the first U.S. Treasury
secretary to do so.” Indeed, the world of finance is now one of the main fronts in the
war against climate change. About 20 countries, including the U.S., made
commitments to stop financing all fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas --
domestically and abroad by the end of 2022, “except in limited and clearly defined
circumstances that are consistent with a 1.5°C warming limit and the goals of the Paris
Agreement."

Another financial commitment raised eyebrows. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for
Net Zero (GFANZ), which was launched in April, announced that it now has “over
$130 trillion of private capital committed to transforming the economy for net zero”,
and which involves over 450 investment firms in 45 countries. GFANZ accounts for
40% of the world’s financial assets, up from $90 trillion in early October, and it also
said “$100 trillion is needed for net zero over the next three decades''. GFANZ is the
brainchild of Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England and UN Special
Envoy for Climate Action and Finance.

Meanwhile, the Bezos Earth Fund, Ikea Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and
several investment banks announced their new alliance, Global Energy Alliance for
People and Planet, to utilize $100 billion for renewable energy, low-carbon green tech
and jobs in the clean energy sector.

For Japan, green finance seems like a great opportunity and indeed Tokyo’s
government has pushed the idea that the nation’s capital could become a regional or
even a global hub for sustainable finance. However, with Japan’s central government
yet to embark on a sovereign green bond issuance and with the nation’s borders slow
to open due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Tokyo’s chances of overseeing the flows of
green finance look challenging.

| For Japan, green finance seems like a great opportunity and indeed Tokyo’s |
| government has pushed the idea that the nation’s capital could become a regional or |
| even a global hub for sustainable finance. However, with Japan’s central government |
| yet to embark on a sovereign green bond issuance and with the nation’s borders slow |

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ Nuclear
Over the next 15 years, China will build up to 150 new nuclear reactors, more than the
total built by the rest of the world in the past 35 years. The price tag could reach $440
billion. This decision comes as China has experienced power shortages and
blackouts. Uranium prices have jumped on this news. By 2025, China is expected to
surpass the U.S. as the world's largest generator of nuclear power.

Oil price forecast
Bank of America predicts that the price of Brent crude oil will soar 45% in the next 7
months, reaching $120 a barrel by June 2022. Last week, Brent traded at about $83 a
barrel. Bank of America bases this prediction on its belief in continued economic
growth following the release of pent-up consumer demand as the pandemic ends. But
it also points to oil demand being boosted by rapidly rising natural gas prices, which
will force some utilities and factories to switch to cheaper gas alternatives, such as oil.

Nigeria/ Solar
Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and largest economy, will team up with
London-based Bboxx to install its pay-as-you-go solar systems in millions of low-
income households over the next 10 years. Bboxx will bring energy to as many as 20
million people. About 47% of Nigerians, equal to 85 million people, don’t have access
to the power grid. The British government is helping to finance the project.

Nuclear/ Emissions
Since 1970, nuclear reactors have cut 72 billion tons in CO2 emissions worldwide,
according to the World Nuclear Performance Report 2021. The world’s 441
operational nuclear reactors provide 10 percent of global electricity, and almost one
third of all low-carbon electricity. Nuclear electricity generation must double between
2020 and 2050 if the world is to meet net-zero goals, the report said.

Pakistan/ Renewable energy
By 2030, renewables will account for about 60 percent of Pakistan’s energy supply, of
which nearly half will come from solar and wind. Currently, only about 7% of Pakistan's
total installed power capacity comes from renewable energy. A World Bank study
found seven sites in Pakistan with tremendous solar-wind hybrid potential.

Romania/ Nuclear
John Kerry, the U.S. Presidential Envoy for Climate, met with Romanian President
Klaus Iohannis to announce that country’s plan to build small modular reactors (SMR).
For starters, Romania will receive over $2 million in U.S. technical assistance to turn
the country into an SMR educational and training hub for Eastern Europe. Also, the
U.S. Export–Import Bank signed an MoU with Romania to explore options around as
much as $7 billion in financing.

Russia/ Gas
Gazprom won’t book additional transit capacity via its natural gas pipelines through
Ukraine and Poland for January-September 2022. This sends a clear signal that Russia
won’t supply Europe with more than current contractual volumes, at least via those
two routes. However, Russia said it could start sending additional gas to Europe once
its own domestic storage tanks are replenished. Europe relies on Russia for about
one-third of its gas supplies.

Turkey/Wind
By 2030, the country will triple wind power capacity from today’s 8.8 GW to about 25
GW. Turkey’s generation capacity consists of 3,600 turbines at 274 power plants. In
terms of overall renewable energy capacity, Turkey ranks fifth in Europe; more
specifically, Turkey ranks first in Europe in geothermal energy, and second in
hydropower, of which it has about 26 GW of installed capacity. On Oct. 7, the Turkish
parliament ratified the Paris climate agreement.

UAE/ Renewables
Starting next year, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) will use renewable
energy to power its operations. Toward that goal, ADNOC signed a deal with the
Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC) to receive 100% of its power from
either nuclear and solar generation facilities starting January 2022. This partnership
will make ADNOC the first major oil and gas company to decarbonize its power at
scale. This could save the company as much as 9 million metric tons of CO2 emissions
each year.

UK/ Fossil fuels
New research from Friends of the Earth slammed the UK for 40 fossil fuel projects that
are in the works — 30 offshore oil and gas projects, seven onshore developments and
three coal mines. Over their projected lifespan, these 40 projects might emit almost
triple the UK’s yearly GHG emissions, or approximately equivalent to 1.3 billion metric
tons of CO2, the environmental group said.
