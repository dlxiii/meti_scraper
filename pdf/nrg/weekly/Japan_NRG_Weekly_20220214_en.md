Mitsui to invest in Canadian hydrogen production tech developer
(New Energy Business News, Feb. 9)
•  Trading house Mitsui & Co. invested in Canada's EKONA Power, a developer of next-generation
technology for producing clean hydrogen.

•  EKONA focuses on a technology that extracts hydrogen and solid carbon from methane, called
methane pyrolysis. This can reduce CO2 emissions during production while keeping costs at the
same level as conventional hydrogen production using steam reforming (i.e., from gas).
•  Since most of the carbon is produced as solid carbon, EKONA's technology does not require CO2
treatment, making it possible to produce clean hydrogen while utilizing existing natural gas and
LNG infrastructure.
•  Mitsui aims to develop a business based on EKONA's technology for hydrogen production mainly

in Japan.

TEPCO again asks for help from other regions as snow cuts solar output
(Jiji, Feb. 10)
•  On Feb. 10, TEPCO Holdings requested Chubu Electric and Kansai Electric to supply up to 800
MW of spare generation capacity as demand for electricity across TEPCO’s network threatened to
outstrip supply.
•  It’s the second time this winter that TEPCO Holdings has called on other utilities to supply it with

electricity.
•  Bad weather combined with low temperatures has caused output from solar panels to drop and
demand for heating to increase.
• TAKEAWAY: Tokyo power demand surpassed 52 GWh on the morning of Feb. 10, a big jump from about 46
GWh at the same time a day earlier, according to TESLA Asia Pacific analytics. Meanwhile, the snowy, overcast
weather cut solar generation to 15% of what it was the previous day, Solcast data show.

• For a close look at how these dynamics are playing out across Japan and the impact on the decarbonization
process, see the deep dive in our Analysis section.



Hitachi, NTT to establish DC grid with undersea cable linking northern projects

(Nikkei, Feb 7)
•  PM Kishida announced an upgrade to Japan’s electricity grid that will see Hokkaido and mainland
Honshu linked by an undersea cable.
•  It’s believed the cable will carry direct current, not alternating current.
•  DC’s advantage is lower transmission loss over distances and more compatibility with renewables
sources. However, this requires building infrastructure to convert DC to AC.
•  According to NEDO, DC has a cost advantage over AC at distances above 50 km for undersea

cables (800 km for terrestrial transmission lines).
•  Hitachi Group has expertise in 800 kV DC transmission grids that carry electricity up to 2000 km.
Hitachi HVDC Technologies CEO Nishioka Atsushi believes DC will eventually replace AC as the
chief mode of long-distance transmission.
•  NTT is investing in DC grid research that envisages small-scale grids that distribute locally-
generated renewable energy over distances of a few kilometers.




ENEOS offshore wind pivot blown apart by Mitsubishi’s industry “benchmark”
(Zaiten, March 2022 edition)
•  CONTEXT: In late December 2021, the government announced that the first three auctions for
offshore wind power projects in Akita and Chiba prefectures were all won by groups consisting of

Mitsubishi Corp and a unit of Chubu Electric. The lowest winning bid was ¥11.99/ kW.

•  ENEOS Chairman Sugimori ordered the purchase of Japan Renewable Energy Corp. (JRE) from
Goldman Sachs partly on expectations that the firm would win several offshore wind tenders.
•  ENEOS expected to secure offshore wind power projects in Akita, Nagasaki and Hokkaido for a
price in the upper ¥20 range. Based on that price level, ENEOS / JRE forecast paying off debts
within 20 years. ENEOS President Ota and Chairman Sugimori believed JRE could see ¥50 billion

free cash flow from 2030 and that wind generation will become the main source of earnings next
decade.
•  Goldman Sachs rushed to sell JRE fearing the offshore wind power boom would collapse.
Goldman targeted ENEOS, Tokyo Gas, JERA, Kyushu Electric, Toyota, NTT and overseas funds
and tried to get a ¥400 billion valuation for JRE (twice the eventual sale price).
•  Most potential buyers withdrew due to Goldman’s quoted price. Toyota walked away because

Goldman refused to give a detailed asset assessment.
•  Now that the first offshore tender results are out, no one will buy JRE even for ¥100 billion,
according to one market analyst.

JERA executive admits to shock seeing Mitsubishi wind tender offer
(Toyo Keizai, Feb. 10)
o  Yajima Satoshi executive officer speaks about JERA’s bids in some of the offshore wind

tenders held last year.
o  Yajima: “When I saw the scores of bidders, I was shocked. I had thought even the
numbers we came up with would be shocking [to those involved in the event of a JERA
victory], but I was wrong.”
o  “Looking at the results, there was a huge gap between us and the second-place group. I
am puzzled as to how we could have been so far behind.”

o  “Maybe they did some kind of creative work regarding the retailing of electricity or
environmental values.”
o  JERA will need to review its strategy for future offshore wind tenders but will take a close
look at them, Yajima said.



Renova looks to develop 450 MW offshore wind project in Chiba

(New Energy Business News, Feb. 9)
•  Renova released an environmental assessment report for a planned offshore wind power
generation project off the coast of Isumi City, Chiba Prefecture, that would house as many as 47
bottom-fixed turbines for a maximum total output of 450 MW. It’s expected to take two to three
years to complete.
•  The area is about 10,500 hectares in a zone designated as "promising " under the Act on the

360 MW offshore wind power project off the coast of Happo Town and Noshiro City, Akita

Prefecture. The project would have a monopile type foundation structure.
•  MoE called for minimizing environmental impact due to the shadows cast by the wind turbines,
and the impact on birds due to collisions with equipment.



Utilities set to profit from power usage data

(Nikkei, Feb. 7)
•  Major utilities, including TEPCO and KEPCO, will soon sell data on subscribers’ electricity usage to
courier giant Sagawa and insurance company Sompo Japan.
•  Electricity usage data can help identify consumer movements and travel patterns.
•  Amendments to the Electricity Business Act will open the way for utilities to sell data on power
usage with the consent of the subscriber from April.
•  Third-party audits will aim to prevent information on individuals being divulged.




Floating offshore platforms to benefit local industries
(Nikkei, Feb. 7)
•  The advent of floating offshore wind farms represents a significant business opportunity for Japan’s
metalworking and shipbuilding industries.
•  Floating platforms, which can weigh up to 2000 tons, are stabilized using giant anchors and chains,

most of which are manufactured locally.
•  Significant demand is also projected for specialized construction craft, such as Toda Corporation’s
“Float Raiser”, which can eliminate the need to deploy large cranes.
•  The Japanese government has set a target to see 60% of wind farm components manufactured in
Japan by 2040.




TEPCO asks Tokyo to recognize big hydro as renewable energy
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 9)
•  The Tokyo Metropolitan Government held a meeting to discuss how to achieve its plan to cut the
city’s CO2 by 50% by 2030 (compared with 2000). Six companies attended.
•  TEPCO Energy Partner (EP) called for the addition of large-scale hydroelectric power to the list of

sources classified as renewable energy in the city’s "Energy Environment Plan," a document used
to oblige utilities to set decarbonization targets and publish ongoing progress.
•  TEPCO EP said non-fossil power sources including nuclear and highly efficient thermal generation
are also important to achieve carbon neutrality. The company said it was not appropriate to require

Japan offers to divert some of its LNG cargos to Europe
(Japan NRG, Feb. 10)
•  METI minister Hagiuda said the government decided to divert some LNG to Europe in the event a
crisis over Ukraine leads to supply disruption.
•  Japan is the first country to respond to a request from the U.S. to help Europe in case natural gas
supplies from Russia are disrupted.

•  Hagiuda stressed that Japan would make sure it has enough LNG to meet domestic needs when
allocating LNG cargoes to Europe.
•  Several LNG ships are already heading to Europe and will arrive later in February, with more
expected in coming months.
• TAKEAWAY: PM Kishida has yet to meet President Biden, seen as a must for a strong Japanese leader. He is
keen to show solidarity with Japan’s top ally as it should play well with the domestic audience ahead of the

important upper-house elections in early summer. However, Kishida and Japan cannot afford to spare many
LNG cargos, so the actual volumes it would send are negligible compared to the volumes Russia supplies to
Europe by pipeline.
• Interestingly, some Japanese LNG cargo is reportedly on route to Europe even though there are no reports of

Russia not meeting contractual obligations to Europe. This is likely because there are a few “spare” LNG
cargos in the system. But, if this is done because of state actor involvement, the rationale would be:
• 1) Japan’s LNG (slightly) boosts Europe’s local gas stockpiles, which helps to lower European gas prices as well
as (slightly) improve energy security

• 2) A drop in European gas prices should lower Asian LNG prices and (maybe) help to begin the process of
cooling broader energy prices

• 3) LNG that Japan can divert to Europe is (mostly) sourced from the U.S., where sellers are open to cargo
resales in return for a share of the resale profits

• Given the large gap in price between Japan’s long-term LNG contracts and the spot market in Europe,
Japanese companies diverting cargo to the EU stand to make handsome profits.
• This situation could help Japan advance what it has long advocated for in LNG markets: a regional network of

LNG energy storage hubs. In theory, in time of need countries / companies could ask for urgent LNG deliveries
from such hubs, rather than search for spare capacity among producers or buyers. The hub should appeal to
security-conscious energy buyers, broadening LNG’s appeal. METI hopes that this would allow Japanese firms
to continue being both major LNG buyers and re-sellers, while also strengthening the nation’s energy security.

JERA unit increases LNG procurement for trading
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Feb. 9)
o  JERA's trading subsidiary in Singapore, JERA Global Markets Ltd., is increasing its
presence in the market. In the current fiscal year, which ends next month, JERAGM has

already procured about 4.1 million tons of spot LNG (63 vessels) by the end of January.
That’s up from about 3 million tons in the previous year.
o  This will also contribute to the profits of TEPCO and Chubu Electric, JERA’s shareholders.
o  CONTEXT: JERA holds 67% of the shares in JERA Global Markets, while the trading
subsidiary of France’s EDF holds 33%.

o  JERA Global Markets has expanded its trading by taking advantage of price differences
between Asia and Europe, and currently operates in four regions around the world. With
TEPCO and Chubu Electric, two of the world's largest users of LNG and coal, as buyers,
JERAGM is in an advantageous position to "buy first and sell when we no longer need
it.” Kasai Kazunori, CEO of JERAGM, said.
o  JERAGM hedges almost all of its supply through futures trading, and uses JERA's fleet of

12 tankers to flexibly change the destination of its cargoes depending on the situation.
o  With Japan’s LNG demand set to decline over the years, “it is not enough for each
company to buy separately. We need a logical solution,” Kasai said.
o  Regarding the situation in Ukraine, Kasai said it is also an opportunity to review the LNG
procurement strategy.

ANALYSIS


BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Japan Struggles to Find Balance
Between Established Power Sources and Renewables

Like many countries, Japan has to juggle the current reality of power supply with its
net-zero goals. While there’s no going back to the primacy of fossil fuels, Japan is
taking small steps to resolve immediate energy issues, while hoping for a lucky break
in future “dream” technologies to meet its 2030 and 2050 reduction commitments.

Great challenges abound, however. For example, the expansion of renewable energy
has resulted in transmission capacity bottlenecks, causing solar output curtailment. At
the same time, moving to a system in which thermal power plays a supporting role to
renewables throws up technical and economic issues.

In June, the government hopes to shed light on how those issues might be resolved
by publishing a new Clean Energy Strategy. It will act as a roadmap for how to achieve
the 46% carbon reduction from FY2013 levels Japan has promised, a vow based on a
doubling of the renewables’ share and a halving of thermal capacity.

The Strategy will need to rally the entire energy sector so that disparate actors learn
to work together. Without that spirit of cooperation, Japan faces an unnecessary
waste of time and resources, and the clinging on to short-term fixes, such as
extending the life of half-century old thermal units to survive peak demand periods.

Coal saves Tokyo, again
As the climate becomes more extreme, major population and industrial hubs like
Tokyo and Chubu face stronger cold spells and summer heat. In recent years, these
regions have weathered such periods largely thanks to coal and old gas plants.

One of the two thermal plants in Tokyo run by JERA, Japan’s biggest power utility,
came online at the start of the 1970s. Two of JERA’s five stations in the Chiba region,

next to Tokyo, have operated since the 1960s and 70s, while a third is already retired
with plans for a replacement.

Without these plants that burn coal, gas and oil, lights would go off.

In January 2021, when Northeast Asian power utilities were scrambling for LNG
supplies amid cold winter, Japan’s coal power usage rose to 41% of total power.

A cold snap hit Japan again last month. On Jan. 6, heavy snow blanketed Tokyo,
driving power demand to a 14-year high. Capacity requirements hit 5.4 GW, above
the forecasted worst-case scenario of 5.3 GW. Another snowfall in Tokyo last week, on
Feb. 10, led Japan’s grid operator to ask two other regions to send Tokyo up to 800
MW of excess power during the day because peak demand pushed the local utility,
TEPCO, to run at 96% capacity.

In all the above cases, power systems across several regions ramped up thermal
output to avoid blackouts, with output from solar waning during snowfall. Yet, the
segregation inherent in Japan’s grid means that even help from other regions is
limited by the narrow volumes that can be moved nationwide.

Since the January 2021 LNG supply crunch, and because of it, METI is slowing plans
to scrap thermal plants. Should utilities decommission aging equipment as standard,
by 2030, Japan could lose 16.77 GW of thermal power. Most are oil-fired. Coal
capacity, however, will increase by 1.87 GW by 2030.

METI’s actions to slow decommissioning may help for a few years, but no longer.
Japan’s coal-fired plants alone could eat up the CO2 allotment for the power system
in the 2030 emissions plan.

The other side of the problem
While METI tries to keep older thermal capacity afloat to meet today’s needs, national
energy policy calls for a wider rollout of renewable energy. However, as more solar
and other intermittent energy sources hook up to the grid, they are not integrated in
an efficient manner.

Kyushu area is a good example. Since 2015, solar operators have been asked to cut
output as the area’s power generation exceeded demand and transmission capacity.
Kyushu Electric expects that from April 2021 to March 2022, some 580 GWh of solar
power will be curtailed. The forecast for the next fiscal year is worse: 730 GWh of solar
generation to be curtailed in Kyushu, about 440 MWh in Shikoku and 976 MWh in
Okinawa. (See the Analysis section of NRG’s Jan. 24 issue for details.)

Without a solution, the trend of wasting energy will only exacerbate as Japan moves
to establish an offshore wind industry, with licenses for 10 GW of capacity to be
awarded by 2030. The most promising offshore wind zones are in Japan’s north, the
Tohoku and the Hokkaido regions, which have no power shortages. In fact, the
Hokkaido projects have yet to progress to tender stage because the regional power
transmission operator says there’s no room in the local grid.

The solution for Kyushu, Tohoku and Hokkaido, is to send excess power to regions
such as Tokyo and Chubu which face a dearth of energy. That will require expanding
power transmission capacity, a process expected to take 10-15 years and require
massive investments.

In the short-term, local grids in areas with excess electricity from renewables will ask
thermal power plants to operate at lower run rates, giving solar and wind energy more
space. Kyushu Electric reported that on May 3, 2021, when the area’s demand hit an
annual low, thermal power accounted for just 13.2% of total daily output. For the
month of May, thermal power’s share was 25%.


Solutions via a centralized grid
Power grid operators say the best way to harmonize disparities is on a central basis,
rather than a micro or area basis. Kyushu Electric told METI that it plans to introduce a
centralized transmission system in mid 2022 and this should reduce curtailment
volumes by about 7%. Other grids will also centralize their network.

Grids typically inform solar companies about the need to curtail output at 17:00 the
day before, but region-wide power output plans are updated early in the morning
each day. This gives a regional grid operator better overview and time to react.

Dynamic pricing is another solution. Trials are underway for individual and corporate
consumers to adjust their power demand in line with times of energy surplus.

Japan bets on “dream” technologies
METI hopes technology can resolve the disconnect between thermal power-backed
energy security and underutilized renewable resources. The biggest potential is seen
in enhanced storage batteries and in utilizing redundant renewable power to make
hydrogen, ammonia and synthetic fuel to be used for co-firing of coal power plants.
These ambitions are supported by R&D financing from the Green Innovation Fund.

In June, PM Kishida is expected to announce a Clean Energy Strategy with more
details on the above, building on the scenario stated in the 6th Basic Energy Plan.

Experts, however, warn that it’s risky to place the country’s future in technologies that
don't yet operate commercially. An example of how this can go wrong occurred just
two years ago. METI placed much hope in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
coal plants, which boasted 46-50% energy efficiency and were heralded as miracle
technologies. Two IGCC plants came online in 2020 but following multiple technical
issues in 2021 they were excluded from the 2022 power supply plan.

The goal that Kishida’s government wants to achieve with the Clean Energy Strategy
is to cut power sector emissions to 219 million tons/ year, from the present 422 million
tons/ year. But for that to happen the deeper underlying issue that has to be resolved
is how the traditional energy system can work together with the new one that’s based
on variable renewable energy.

Unless these two disparate systems can find a way to coexist and cooperate over the
next 10-20 years, the overall goal of net-zero by 2050 will be nothing but a pipe
dream.

ANALYSIS


BY DAN SHULMAN
PRINCIPAL
SHULMAN ADVISORY

The Upcoming Rise of Grid-Scale Batteries in Japan
Japan!s government recently hinted that it would seek to address the Achille!s heel of
renewable energy from intermittent sources, such as solar and wind, by further
opening up the power grid to batteries. As national energy strategy points to ever-
increasing amounts of renewables in the power mix, the issue of balancing the grid is
becoming much more important, both in order to accommodate more green
electricity and for energy security.

Despite the current legislative grey zone around batteries, the market for storage is
already starting to take off, partly driven by declining costs. Early adopters in Japan
have installed about 400,000 battery units as of FY2020, creating the sector almost
from scratch in the last five years. Cumulative capacity in commercial and industrial
battery applications could see the market more than double over the current decade,
METI forecasts show.

Still, while current and future uses are well-defined on paper, regulations are still
being discussed especially around the entirely new niche of freestanding batteries.
The latter could create new types of business models and players in the power market
once their place in the system is defined.


Current and Future Use Cases Considered by METI













Market size and potential
The Japanese battery market stood at 9.6 GWh in FY2019 - 6 GWh in commercial and
industrial buildings and factories; 2.4 GWh in residential; and 1.2 GWh integrated into
power plants or freestanding. METI forecasts that the market will expand to 11.8 GWh
in FY2025 and 24.2 GWh in FY2030.

METI expects that the reduction in battery costs will be a key driver of this growth.
The ministry aims to reduce the installed cost of batteries in houses from ¥190,000/
kWh in FY2019 to ¥70,000/ kWh in FY2030. The target for installed costs in
commercial and industrial buildings is ¥60,000/ kWh in FY2030, down from ¥240,000/
kWh in FY2019.

Currently, behind-the-meter batteries make up most of the installed capacity and are
usually used to maximize local consumption of locally generated renewable energy, or
as a back-up solution in case of emergency. METI expects the development of virtual
power plants to aggregate such storage capacity and optimize its use at grid level.
Batteries have also been integrated into generating assets, particularly in Hokkaido,
which mandates storage at large PV solar plants. In the Hokkaido grid, PV power
plants of 2 MW or larger must ensure that the plant’s total output fluctuation (PV +
battery) is less than or equal to 1% of the power plant capacity per minute. For
example, for a 10 MW plant the power fluctuation must be within +/-100 kW/ minute.



New driver: FIP
Batteries integrated with generation assets might become more popular with the
introduction of the Feed-in-Premium system starting in April 2022. Generators will
have the opportunity to increase revenues under the FIP system by being savvy in how
they trade power.
Onsite storage equipment would allow more flexibility in matching output with
periods of high prices, making it attractive to investors. Under the FIP, generators are
also responsible for balancing their systems, and storage assets could help to
minimize imbalance penalties.

Power transmission companies have also been experimenting with integrating
batteries in substations. According to METI, four pilot projects totaling 420 MWh are
currently operating. We can, however, expect transmission firms to leverage the
balancing market instead of investing in their own storage assets in the future.
Freestanding batteries are still mainly part of pilot projects with, for example,
Sumitomo installing 600 kWh in Kagoshima Prefecture in 2015, or NEDO last year
subsidizing a Sumitomo 2 MW installation in the U.S. In August 2021, Tesla
announced a 6 MWh battery in Hokkaido to be commissioned in summer of 2022 - its
first project in Japan.

More projects are expected. Some renewable energy developers are positioning
themselves on the nascent market and developing valuation models or even applying
for grid connection authorization from grid operators.
The government is keen to encourage freestanding battery development, allocating
¥13 billion in subsidies last November. These funds are expected to cover one-to-two
thirds of installation costs. However, regulations regarding freestanding batteries have
yet to be finalized by METI, which is holding back some developments.



Current Regulations for Freestanding Batteries in Japan
Under the current Electricity Business Act, large-scale batteries are treated as
accessories of substations or power plants. In November 2020, METI launched a
committee on “Spreading Stationary Power Storage Systems” to understand what
policies or strategies the government further needs to accelerate the development of
both the battery market and industrial competitiveness. Front-of-the-meter (FOM)
batteries used to balance power in the grid are one battery type to be discussed.
The committee published an interim report on Dec. 27, 2021 that outlined revisions to
the Electricity Business Law that says developers will need to obtain a generation
license for freestanding battery assets, allowing the regulator to control output

20

capacity in times of tight supply. Licensed battery owners will have to follow supply
orders in times of need. The government is also considering new regulations to
promote the future use of these batteries for storing renewable power surplus and for
hydrogen production.
The wheeling charges for these assets will also follow a special rule. If owners notify
grid operators prior to signing the contract, owners won’t pay a wheeling charge
when receiving power from the grid. However, they will pay charges for any power
losses due to battery conversion and when they supply power to the market.
However, there was no mention of wheeling charge rules in the interim report.








Regarding balancing requirements of the asset, conversion losses should be
accounted for in the corresponding retail balancing group, while the output power will
be part of the generation balancing group.





METI uses pumped hydro storage as a reference to decide on the regulations to be
applied to freestanding batteries, so it is likely that these assets will also be allowed to
participate in the same markets as pumped hydro, including the capacity market.
Given that regulations are still being finalized, grid operators are cautious over issuing
connection licenses for freestanding batteries projects, with the exception, to some
extent, of Hokkaido. We expect this to change once one of the major companies
involved in pilot projects, or in advising METI, develops the first projects.


Interest despite uncertainty
In its latest reports METI highlights several topics that still need to be finalized
regarding freestanding batteries. Amongst these are the clarification of the
monetization of assets; a better understanding of the environmental value of using
batteries in different markets; and setting the margins on the inter-regional
connection capacity to account for battery use. Also, still to be settled are regulations
on cost distributions between retailers and generators using the same asset, along
with safety regulations.
It’s still difficult to create a clear quantitative business model for freestanding
batteries, but more and more pieces of the puzzle are falling into place and the first
assets are being developed. We expect an increase of project announcements and
more companies to integrate these assets into business portfolios as soon as the fiscal
year starts in April.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ CCS
Energy company Santos acquired depleted gas reservoirs that it will use to store as
much as 100 million tons of CO2. Santos is building the Moomba carbon capture and
storage project with Beach Energy. Operations start in 2024 and will capture 1.7
million tons of CO2 yearly.

Australia/ Hydrogen energy
A report on the green hydrogen industry predicts “exponential growth” for
electrolysers in the near future. By 2027, Australia’s green hydrogen could reach cost
parity with blue hydrogen, which is produced by natural gas.

Asia/ Natural gas
If natural gas becomes an energy outcast, Asia faces a massive decommissioning bill,
claims the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, adding that “62% of
LNG import terminal capacity and 61% of gas-fired power capacity is unlikely to be
built due to unfavorable fundamental project factors”. Asia has $358 billion of
planned gas projects.

France/ Nuclear
In an effort to slash GHGs, President Macron pledged to spend €50 million by 2028 to
build six new-generation nuclear reactors, with the option to build eight more by
2050. Nuclear energy already provides France with 70% of its total power, but that
fleet of 56 reactors has aged considerably.

Norway/ Offshore wind power
Later this year the Scandinavian country will hold its first tender for bottom-fixed
offshore wind power projects to be built in the southern part of the North Sea. The
goal is to develop 1.5 GW of generation capacity.

Saudi Arabia/ Green investment
Fitch and Moody’s assigned debut ratings to the country’s $500 billion sovereign
Public Investment Fund, which is preparing to invest at home and abroad, and to issue
“green bonds”. Fitch gave a long-term default rating of A. Moody’s gave an A1 long-
term rating.

Spain/ Renewables
The Catalan government’s 2050 energy roadmap calls for 12 GW of new renewables
by 2030 — 5 GW of wind and 7 GW of solar. The region needs to build about 62 GW
of installed capacity by mid-century to achieve full decarbonisation of its electricity
system.

UK/ Energy crisis
The price cap on household energy bills will jump 54%, increasing £693 to £1,971 per
year. Record rises in global gas prices are driving this inflation, and 22 million British
households will be impacted. The government plans £9 billion in measures to mitigate
the price hikes.

UK/ EV batteries
Glencore and Britishvolt will build a battery recycling plant. With scheduled
completion in late 2023, the plant will be the first battery recycling facility in the UK
for the two companies. It will have a processing capacity of at least 10,000 tons of
lithium-ion batteries per year.

U.S./ Solar energy
Trump-era tariffs on imported solar panels were extended. However, double-sided
panels for large projects remain exempt. Also, the amount of solar cells for solar
panels that can be imported tariff-free has increased from 2.5 GW to 5 GW of
capacity.

U.S./ Generating capacity
Almost 28 GW of new generating capacity was added to the grid in 2021, 12% more
than 2020. However, 8.5 GW of capacity was retired in 2021. Wind and solar
dominated the new power additions, accounting for 41% and 36%, respectively.
