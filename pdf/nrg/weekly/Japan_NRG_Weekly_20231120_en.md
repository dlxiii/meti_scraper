NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY






Japan targets technology shift to make CCS cheaper; to create new ships

(Japan NRG, Nov 15)
•  Japan seeks to move Carbon Capture from the current chemical absorbent method to an approach
based on solid absorbents, which should cut the cost of capturing one ton of CO2 in half. Further
technological evolutions and cost reductions are also in the works, according to a presentation
made by NEDO.
•  It costs $40 to trap one ton of CO2 using a chemical reaction. Updating the process to physical

absorption (which dissolves CO2 into a liquid) can lower this amount to $20-$30, but moving
entirely to solid adsorbents should drop the number to $20, said Director General of NEDO’s
Environmental Dept, Fukunaga Shigekazu, speaking at the CCS Forum in Tokyo.
•  The technological leap will be possible this decade and may be superseded by 2030 with the
membrane separation method, which could take the costs to $15, he said.
•  This year, NEDO started a pilot project using solid adsorbent materials at Kansai Electric’s Maizuru
coal-fired power plant. CO2 captured there will be liquified, put into CO2 storage tanks and

shipped to a receiving facility in Tomakomai, Hokkaido. The latter is the only active CCS site in
Japan at present.
•  Ships that can carry 1,000 tons of liquified CO2 are in the works and will start operating in 2024;
specialist storage tanks will also be ready soon, the official said. Annual shipments will total about
10,000 tons of CO2.
•  The Maizuru facility will capture about 40 tons of CO2/ day.
•  CONTEXT: In addition to KEPCO, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and think-tank RITE are involved in

developing CC technology. The transportation of the CO2 and its storage is spearheaded by the
Japan CCS Co. consortium, the Engineering Advancement Association of Japan, trading house
Itochu and Nippon Steel.
•  The pilot project, including the transportation and injection of CO2 into the Tomakomai site, will
run through Feb 2027.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI to submit CCS Business Act to Parliament in early 2024
(Japan NRG, Nov 15)
o  The ministry was unable to submit to Parliament the Act to govern the CCS industry this
calendar year due to supplementary budget deliberations. However, it should be able to
do so in the first parliamentary session of 2024, said Saeki Norihiko, Director for CCS
Policy Office at the METI.

o  The CCS sector will not be amenable to companies looking for quick profits, but METI
believes that market players that take a longer-term approach will do well because the
technology will be vital for the economy.
o  The ministry will do its best to support the CCS sector and believes that Japan has
companies that could play a role in every part of the CCS value chain.
o  Also, Japan has a greater carbon storage volume potential than METI drew up in its CCS
strategy, but further reviews are needed to confirm this, Saeki said.

o  CONTEXT: The national strategy for CCS calls for the sector to start operating on a
commercial footing from 2030, collecting between 6 and 12 million tons of CO2 a year.
By 2050, the goal is to store between 120 and 240 million tons of CO2 a year.
• TAKEAWAY: The govt sees Carbon Capture, (Utilization) and Storage as one of the most important new
industries, along with efforts to build a hydrogen-focused economy. The business models that will allow this to

work, however, are less clear. METI’s presentation at the CCS Forum had some inconsistencies. One was
around the 2030 target for annual storage, which on one slide was described as 6-12 million tons and on
another as 13 million tons, of which 30% (i.e. about 3.9 million tons) would be “exported overseas”. That
suggests Japan has negotiated specific storage volumes with Malaysia (where Mitsui & Co. leads a CCS
project) and Oceania (where Mitsubishi Corp and Nippon Steel are leading a Japan-backed project).

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
About 400 CCS and transportation projects in the works globally
(Japan NRG, Nov 15)
o  There were 392 carbon capture and transportation facilities in the works as of July 2023,
double the number a year earlier, said the Global CCS Institute at the CCS Forum in

Tokyo. Growth is driven by policy in North America and Europe in particular.

o  Today, there are 41 facilities operating, capturing 49 million tons of CO2 per annum. A
further 32 million tons of CO2 per year of capture capacity is under construction.
o  That is still only a fraction of the 1 billion tons of CO2 that need to be captured globally
by 2030 to achieve climate goals, according to the Institute.





KEPCO and K Line ink contract for liquefied CO2 ship design
(Company statement, Nov 14)
•  KEPCO and K Line plan to develop a CCS value chain. They completed a study on liquefied CO2,
targeting emissions from KEPCO’s thermal power plants.
•  This project aims to address challenges in maritime CO2 transport, such as associated costs and
technologies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

KEPCO and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines ink contract for liquefied CO2 ship design
(Company statement, Nov 14)
o  On the same day, KEPCO announced a similar contract with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. The two
will study ship design, transport and technology to build a CCS supply chain.





Sekisui Chemical to install 1 MW perovskite power system on high-rise building
(Japan NRG, Nov 15)
•  Sekisui Chemical plans to install about 1 MW capacity perovskite solar (PSC) power system on a 45-
story building in Tokyo; the world’s first PSC on a high-rise building.
•  Work on the building, called South Tower, begins in 2024 and will be completed in 2028 along
with the PSC installation. The modules will be placed on wall spandrels.
•  CONTEXT: Solar panel installations on

building walls have hitherto been
limited due to the panel weight and
their exposure to wind. Sekisui’s PSC
modules are thin perovskite crystal and
electrode layers on films. The company
says their flexibility makes them suited

for building wall installations. Some
researchers, however, warn film-based
PSCs are vulnerable to moisture and will
have short life cycles.
• TAKEAWAY: This plan suggests the company is close to establishing a PSC mass production system, which
would be a major breakthrough. PSC production involves nanostructure control of chemicals, making it difficult
to automate the processes. Sekisui’s PSC has a 15% power efficiency, which is not high, and thousands of PSC

units would be required to achieve MW power capacities. Sekisui told Japan NRG that it plans to
commercialize PSCs in 2025 but declined to elaborate where the modules will be produced.

METI allocates ¥860 billion for GX promotion, ¥2 billion to mitigate curtailment
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 13)
•  The FY2023 supplementary budget was approved by the Cabinet. METI is given ¥860 billion to
promote the GX program. Of this, ¥546 billion will go to strengthen the supply chain of

semiconductors and storage batteries.
•  To promote energy efficiency, ¥58 billion was allocated for subsidies for the introduction of high-
efficiency water heaters. Also, METI seeks ¥2 billion for new technology aimed at mitigating
curtailment of renewable energy.
•  CONTEXT: The FY2022 supplementary budget totaled ¥11.3 trillion, but it increased due to relief
measures for consumers of gasoline, electricity, and gas.





METI sets up DAC working group, to launch in January
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 13)
•  METI set up a working group to focus on the technology of capturing CO2 from the atmosphere,
known as DAC (Direct Air Capture).
•  The group will begin discussions in January. During that meeting, participants will provide reports
on the current status of DAC markets and businesses globally. A meeting in April is expected to

present a report with recommendations.
•  CONTEXT: Japan's estimated future residual emissions amount to about 0.5 to 2.4 billion tons
annually. According to METI, companies with significant emissions, such as those in the petroleum
and aviation industries, have been noticeably investing in companies with DAC technology.




ANRE outlines preliminary criteria for hydrogen supply chain subsidies

(Government statement, Nov 14)
•  ANRE has outlined the preliminary criteria for providing subsidies to companies in large-scale
hydrogen and ammonia supply chain projects.
•  The govt will make decisions based on overall assessment, rather than projected costs, meaning
policy priorities and compliance to govt standards will be reflected.
•  The projects need to clear “S+3E” standards, which are safety, energy security, economic

efficiency and environmentally friendly (low carbon intensity).
• TAKEAWAY: Under this framework, hydrogen production for local or in-house consumption will probably not
be eligible for subsidies. Some argue that hydrogen – whether liquid or compressed gas – releases carbon
when transported by trucks and such big projects defeat the purpose of decarbonization.

Obayashi and EG form JV to build hydrogen power plant in New Zealand
(Company statement, Nov 13)
•  Obayashi, one of Japan’s major construction firms, will acquire a 50% stake in Eastland Generation,
a New Zealand-based renewables generation firm focusing on geothermal, hydro and solar

projects.
•  The two firms formed a JV for a hydrogen production plant using geothermal power. In 2021, they
began test sales of the hydrogen.
•  By 2027, EG plans to expand its renewables capacity to about 100 MW.

Asahi Kasei, Gentari, and JGC start FEED for hydrogen project in Malaysia

(Japan NRG, Nov 15)
•  Asahi Kasei, Gentari Hydrogen in Malaysia, and JGC signed a MoU for a FEED study for annual
production of 8,000 tons of green hydrogen using a 60 MW alkaline water electrolyzer system.
Support came from NEDO’s Green Innovation Fund.
•  FEED work begins in January 2024 and the operation is planned to start in 2027.
•  In 2021, Asahi Kasei delivered a 10 MW system to Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field. Six

units of a similar 10 MW system will be deployed in Malaysia.
•  CONTEXT: Asahi Kasei is scaling up production by connecting multiple electrolyzers. In 2024, it
plans to bring on-stream a pilot green hydrogen plant in Kawasaki City consisting of four 0.8 MW
electrolysers.
• TAKEAWAY: METI aims to bring down hydrogen cost to ¥30/ Nm3 by 2030, but according to one consumer,
green hydrogen trades at ¥5,000/ Nm3. Development of new components to boost electrolysis efficiency,

improving endurance and maintenance and increasing system life cycles, are key focus areas to cut capital
costs, Asahi Kasei told Japan NRG.




ENEOS and Air Liquide to develop hydrogen projects

Ube-based chemical firms launch decarbonization initiatives

(Nikkei, Nov 14)
•  Yamaguchi Pref and chemical manufacturers operating locally are speeding up net zero initiatives,
eyeing state support for ammonia and hydrogen infrastructure.
•  UBE and others in the Ube Sanyo-Onoda industrial zone began to co-develop a new cement kiln
fueled by ammonia instead of coal. The companies aim to replace up to 30% of coal with
ammonia, which may be a world first.
•  In the Shunan zone, Idemitsu plans an ammonia import base of 1 million tons/ year.

•  This year, Yamaguchi Pref set up a ¥6 billion fund to subsidize the kiln development and other net
zero projects.
•  CONTEXT: Ube Sanyo-Onoda, Shunan and Iwakuni-Ohtake industrial zones in Yamaguchi have
Japan’s highest concentration of hard-to-abate petrochemical and steel plants. The 36 companies
there have diverse plans including biomass-derived energy, synthetic methane and carbon
recycling. But the Yamaguchi govt decided to focus on ammonia.

• TAKEAWAY: UBE runs two coal power plants in the prefecture, but it is also a major ammonia producer.
However, UBE hasn’t yet revealed how it will meet growing energy sector demand. UBE told Japan NRG that it
has no plan to introduce ammonia co-firing at the power plants, but it will develop an ammonia-fueled cement
kiln.

JFE Steel opens test facility for ammonia tank
(Company statement, Nov 16)
•  At the end of October, JFE Steel opened a new test facility at Kurashiki Steel Works (Okayama
Pref) to develop high-strength steel for ammonia fuel tanks.
•  Ammonia causes stress corrosion cracks (SCC) that leads to leakages. The facility will test the

strength of steel against corrosions, as well as measure electro-chemical properties of steel
exposed to ammonia.
•  CONTEXT: All steel plates corrode when exposed to ammonia or hydrogen for a long period of
time. However, there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to their reaction with steel and other
materials when stored in large quantities. Japan presently limits ammonia storage to 40,000 tons in
one tank, but larger tanks will be required for coal-ammonia co-firing at power plants.

• TAKEAWAY: Steelmakers and tank manufacturers are divided on SCC. Some say chrome-nickel stainless steel
(SUS304 grade) is acceptable. The de facto standard for steel used in hydrogen systems is chrome-nickel-
molybdenum steel (SUS316), which has stronger anti-corrosion properties than SUS304. Idemitsu plans to use
its LPG tanks, made of carbon steel, for ammonia storage. The Clean Fuel Ammonia Association proposes
tanks made of pressed concrete that do not exist in Japan.





IHI receives order for methanation system from NGK Insulators

Key broadcast stations disclose production carbon footprint
(Japan NRG, Nov 16)
•  Key broadcasting media companies disclosed the carbon footprint of program production at the

Inter BEE 2023 conference in Chiba.
•  NHK reported 1.11 tons of CO2-equivalent were released per one hour program production. Fuji
Television Network emitted 1.07 tons per one hour program.
•  NHK’s decarbonization plans include using less air conditioners, public transport where possible,
reducing print outs, shift to EVs and subscriptions to renewable-derived power services.
•  Fuji has offset its emissions with J-Credits. TBS Television has introduced one hydrogen-fueled
relay truck and purchased green power certificates.

•  CONTEXT: Some 155 Japanese media companies formed an alliance for public awareness
campaigns. To compare, UK and Canadian broadcast networks have made climate action pledges,
including calculation of all in-house production emissions.
• TAKEAWAY: Some TV sponsors are demanding full carbon footprint disclosures and this is also pushing
broadcast networks to stronger climate initiatives. Virtual reality technologies are also spreading in commercial
production. According to Dentsu, emissions from VR programs are nearly half of real-life filming.

Sumitomo Forestry to develop woody biomass chemical products with GEI

(Company statement, Nov 15)
•  Sumitomo Forestry inked a deal with Green Earth Institute to promote its biorefinery business
using woody biomass.
•  They’ll seek to accelerate shifts from petrochemical products to biomass-based chemical products.
Those woody components can be used for bioplastics, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), foods, bio-
rubbers, and more.
•  CONTEXT: Forest covers nearly two-thirds of Japan. But half of the trees exceed 50 years of age,
which means they don’t absorb CO2 as they used to. Accelerating wood consumption, and

planting new trees, can help CO2 absorption. By 2030, Japan aims to introduce 2 million tons of
bioplastics and replace 10% of jet fuel with SAF.

METI sets price cap for Round 3 of offshore wind auctions

(Government statement, Nov 14)
•  In the latest guidelines for the next auction round for the area off the Sea of Japan in Aomori Pref
and Yusa Town in Yamagata Pref, METI has set the cap on the supply price at ¥18/ kWh, down ¥1
from the ceiling for the second round.
•  While capital, operation and maintenance, as well as removal costs are estimated at a higher level
than in the previous round, the cap on the supply price has been set at ¥18/ kWh, based on the
outlook for an average 4.5% improvement in facility utilization due to factors such as superior wind

conditions.
•  The upper limit of the capacity offer has not yet been determined, but the lower limit is set at 96
MW off the coast of Aomori Pref and 360 MW off the coast of Yamagata, which is 20% less than
the grid capacity already secured.
•  The zero premium level will be set at ¥3/ kWh, just as in the second auction round.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s decision to decrease the auction cap price is at odds with evidence in other markets that
suggests inflation and rising materials costs are pushing up developer costs. However, Japan’s original prices

were more generous than in other markets and the latest price cap change is small. Feedback from industry
players may yet adjust the auction parameters.





Offshore wind eyed in the EEZ, Japan prepares for deployment in multiple areas
(Government statement, Nov 15)
•  Seeking to set up offshore wind power stations in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a Cabinet
Office experts panel began studies on international law issues while METI and MLIT focus on local
issues.
•  Aiming for multiple GW-class wind projects within the EEZ, METI and MLIT will come up with rules

on deciding project locations, local jurisdictions, rights and liabilities since the EEZ falls outside
most regulatory frameworks.
•  The Cabinet panel is clarifying the definition of offshore wind facilities in light of the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea, and reviewing impact on Japanese regulatory rules for
environmental impact assessment, notification processes to other governments, and other issues.
•  CONTEXT: Japan aims to introduce up to 45 GW of offshore wind power by 2040. The govt is
looking at the potential of the EEZ to meet these ambitious targets.

Carbon credit market reaches 12,000 tons; TSE to further boost liquidity
(Denki Shimbun, Nov 14)
•  One month has passed since the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) began trial trading in the Carbon
Credit Market. J-Credits worth about 12,000 tons of CO2 were traded by Nov 11.
•  J-Credits representing emission reductions via the installation of renewable energy accounted for

7,957 tons and credits representing CO2 cuts via energy conservation were 3,732 tons,
representing 98% of the total.
•  With several categories of credits trading, there are variations in prices. J-Credits linked to
renewables ranged from ¥2,730 to ¥3,900; those associated with renewable energy and heat, from
¥2,000 to ¥2,480; and credits tied to energy conservation ranged from ¥1,510 to ¥2,850. Forest
credits ranged from ¥6,046 to ¥9,900.

•  CONTEXT: The market opened on Oct 11. Only J-Credits are traded, with six categories
representing various actions to reduce or avoid CO2 emissions. These include energy
conservation, installation of renewable energy, the use of renewables to produce heat, and forest
management.
•  To enhance the market, the TSE plans to introduce a Market Maker system on a trial basis starting
this month until the end of February 2024. The govt will auction credits that it has issued to market

makers (i.e. financial institutions such as securities firms and banks), which will then trade them on
the broader market.
• TAKEAWAY: It’s hard to make an assessment of a new market sector from its first month in action, but initial
numbers seem good. The key to enhancing liquidity seems to lie in how buyers and sellers reach agreement
on prices and how to increase the creation of credits. The introduction of govt auctions and market makers will
expedite volume building as brokers look to expand their business. Still, there is a cautious mood in the
market. Some worry about the limited scope of J-Credits and the perceived low incentives for buyers. Others

point to recent negative media attention to carbon credits in other countries and uncertainty over this sector’s
future. If Japan can build a reputation for allowing trading of only easily verifiable, quality credits, then it could
become a regional hub for credits.





TEPCO addresses counter-terrorism measures at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP
(Nikkei, Nov 14)
•  TEPCO addressed four critical counter-terrorism measures at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP. These are in
response to an NRA order from April 2021 that halted operations.
•  TEPCO said it completed these improvements. It now awaits the NRA's decision on whether to lift
the operational ban.

•  The NRA is reassessing TEPCO's ability as a nuclear operator following several incidents. Any
restart will need approvals from the local community and the NRA.
•  CONTEXT: More than two years ago, the NRA issued an order that halted operations at the plant
following failures in detecting intrusions and unauthorized entries into the main control room. Since
then, TEPCO has made certain improvements, but in May the NRA identified deficiencies in four of
27 inspected items, prolonging the ban.
• TAKEAWAY: NRA chairman Yamanaka said the inspections are about to end, and a report will be completed.

Also, the NRA will announce its decision regarding TEPCO’s ability to operate the plant. In theory, there is a
15



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

chance that the plant will be able to restart before year's end. Still, TEPCO needs local approval, and this may
take a considerable amount of time.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

TEPCO detects ‘abnormality’ at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP Unit 7
(Company statement, Nov 14)
o  TEPCO detected an abnormality in the fuel cleaning equipment at Unit 7 of Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa NPP. This happened during the cleaning of the 98th fuel assembly, and led to an
immediate suspension of work.
o  They discovered a loose nut of about 1 cm in size within the piston valve device, which is

used to control water flow direction.
o  CONTEXT: A fuel assembly consists of a bundle of fuel rods. It requires regular cleaning,
so as to prevent objects from entering and damaging the fuel rods.




KEPCO seeks extension of operation of nuclear power plants to improve efficiency

(Nikkei, Nov 15)
•  KEPCO seeks to extend the period of continuous operation of nuclear power reactors to 15
months, two months longer than the current period, to improve the utilization rate of its plants.
Discussions with the NRA are underway.
•  The firm will also examine if it could inspect diesel generators and other equipment while the plant
is in operation, in a move to expedite inspections.
•  CONTEXT: The restart of KEPCO’s Takahama Units 1 and 2 (Fukui Pref) earlier in 2023 has helped

with the recovery of the utilization rate of its facilities to 70-80%.
• TAKEAWAY: This move could potentially reduce demand for coal and goal for the utility.

Hitachi wins order for the next-gen Central Power Supply Command Center
(Japan NRG, Nov 16)
•  Hitachi won an order for the next-gen Central Power Supply Command Center from "Transmission
and Distribution Systems," in which 10 general power distribution companies are investors.
•  The project aims to standardize and share specifications for distribution systems used by the major

power companies, excluding Okinawa. This initiative will also contribute to reducing the cost of the
system that each company independently built.
•  Operation of the new unified system will begin in the latter half of the 2020s.
•  Hitachi will utilize technology from Hitachi Energy. It will develop features such as wide-area load
frequency control (LFC), a first for Japan, and optimization calculation functions for nationwide
startup and shutdown of plans, as well as demand-supply control.

•  CONTEXT: Power distribution companies seek to standardize demand-supply and frequency
control specifications, which currently differ among them, to allow for power adjustments across
regional boundaries. This will also enhance flexibility and scalability in anticipation of future
regulatory changes and leverage better information disclosure for demand-supply control.
Currently, each company discloses information through its own disclosure server.
• TAKEAWAY: This is one step toward improving the efficiency of Japan’s power grids by elevating decision-

making to the national level, rather than resolving balancing and other grid issues at a regional level. The goal
is to achieve nationwide merit-order-based, demand-supply adjustment while taking into account congestion
on inter-regional transmission lines and local systems.

Opinion: As Japan aims to decarbonize, it needs to cut CRM reliance on China

(Toyo Keizai, Nov 14)
•  This opinion piece was written by Kitamura Shigeru, a national security advisor under ex-PM Abe
and former head of the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office.
•  The article argues that Japan’s current decarbonization strategy makes it too dependent on
imports of critical raw materials (CRMs) from China, such as lithium batteries and rare earths, which
are used for technologies such as wind turbine motors.
•  Without some control over the supply chain for key components, Japan’s energy policies in
renewables, EVs, and other clean technologies would be swayed by China.

•  This is a risk to Japan’s ability to meet its 2030 emission reduction targets, especially because
China has a dominant position in the global renewables sector.
•  Japan should build an energy strategy on technologies that have secure, diversified supply chains
and home industry advantage, such as in Perovskite solar cells (PSC).
•  CONTEXT: Recent changes in the Chinese political landscape with the death of former PM Li
Keqiang and the arrest of a top Japanese executive in the country will also impact ties between the

two nations, according to the article.
•  Japan’s dependence on China for clean energy tech is increasing; from China, Japan imports
about 55% of lithium essential for EV batteries and 60% of rare earths.

Japan’s Spent Nuclear Fuel Dilemma: KEPCO Seeks a Solution

As Japan’s nuclear power industry faces a rebirth after nearly a decade of dormancy,
nuclear waste disposal is now a priority issue. There are roughly 19,000 metric tons of
radioactive material stored on-site at power plants across Japan, accounting for 80%
of capacity. Finding a solution is not just a matter of safety – there are politics
involved.

No one is as deeply embroiled in the drama as Kansai Electric (KEPCO). It is Japan’s
largest nuclear power operator and the most reliant utility on the atom for electricity.
Worse, it has made a commitment to the prefecture that houses all of its nuclear
stations to relocate all of its nuclear waste elsewhere. That’s a promise that KEPCO is
finding harder and harder to keep as a key deadline approaches.

Within the next six weeks, KEPCO must decide on at least an “interim” storage site
that can accommodate its spent nuclear fuel for several decades (before it can move
to a final waste depository deep underground). Should it fail to do so, then three of
KEPCO’s reactors are at risk of being asked to shut down. While that’s unlikely in the
middle of winter’s peak energy demand season, there's certainly a sense of urgency
among KEPCO top management.

Recently, reports have surfaced that the company has identified potentially suitable
sites for an interim solution, followed by vaguely positive government comments. But
there’s nothing official, as yet. Local government officials, no matter how sympathetic,
will lose face should they allow KEPCO to ignore its own 2023 deadline to present a
plan for removing the waste from Fukui Pref.


What happens to KEPCO will have an impact on the nuclear sector nationwide.

Spent nuclear fuel and storage facilities
Nuclear power relies on fuel made from pellets, which are hardened forms of
processed uranium ore. After being utilized within a nuclear reactor for about four
years, this fuel is removed as it no longer contains sufficient power levels. However, it
still emits radioactivity and heat, and thus needs to be disposed of according to strict
regulations.

The initial approach toward spent fuel involves placing it in on-site pools that are at
least six meters deep, which are designed to cool the spent fuel and prevent radiation
from escaping. Water is effective at blocking gamma rays and neutron radiation.

Pool for spent nuclear fuel storage

Originally, these pools were intended only for short-term storage, with the plan to
eventually transport the spent fuel to off-site locations for reprocessing — to extract
plutonium, purify it, and recycle up to 95-97% of the material into new fuel. However,
technical challenges have caused delays in the reprocessing agenda. METI notes that
storage at power plants is reaching capacity, with about 80% of space already in use.
This has led to safety concerns.

As an alternative, Japan is utilizing centralized “interim storage facilities” to house
spent fuel, which alleviates the pressure on storage capacities at reactor sites. The
idea is for the interim hubs to act as a placeholder until Japan identifies a final nuclear
waste storage site deep underground.

One such interim facility is in operation in Mutsu, close to Rokkasho, which primarily
stores spent fuel from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).

KEPCO’s commitment in Fukui Prefecture
Fukui Prefecture houses seven of KEPCO's nuclear reactors:
– Mihama nuclear power station’s three units, (1.67 GW total capacity);
– Takahama nuclear power station’s four units, (3.39 GW);
– Oi nuclear power station’s three units, (4.71 GW).

The used nuclear fuel is stored in the NPP’s pools, which are set to be full in about
four to seven years. Their capacity has reached 77% at Mihama, 80% at Takahama,
and 87% at Oi.

In the late 1990s, KEPCO made a commitment to locate a temporary waste storage
facility outside the prefecture. The target date was set for late 2018, but later deferred
to 2020; now it has been extended to the end of 2023. If not accomplished, this could
lead to the shutdown of three reactors (Units 1 and 2 at Takahama, and Unit 3 at the
Mihama).

With no immediate solution in sight, KEPCO decided to get creative. On June 12,
KEPCO's president, Mori Nozomu, informed Fukui Governor Sugimoto Tatsuji of their
plan to transport 200 tons of spent nuclear fuel from Takahama to France for research
purposes. KEPCO asserted that this was in line with their commitment, because the
agreement didn’t specify any geographical restrictions on “outside the prefecture”.


The proposed amount to be sent to France represents 5% of the total spent fuel from
the three nuclear plants in Fukui Prefecture. However, regional lawmakers are
skeptical of Mori's assurances. But METI Minister Nishimura supports Mori, stating that
KEPCO's approach was on a par with its pledge to find a temporary storage solution.

KEPCO’s current plans
In theory, nuclear operators like KEPCO should be able to send their spent fuel rods
to a reprocessing plant in Japan that would recycle the useful parts and use them to
make new fuel and leave behind a much smaller waste footprint. The problem is,
Japan’s fuel reprocessing site in Rokkasho Village is not yet online.

So, in October 2023, KEPCO proposed a revised plan. The first measure calls for
training specialists who can ensure the completion of the Rokkasho reprocessing plant
so that it can hopefully be operational by 2025. Then, by 2030, it will gradually
achieve an annual capacity of 800 tons of spent nuclear fuel.

In collaboration with power utilities, industrial manufacturers, and construction firms,
Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd (JNFL) is leading the effort to finalize construction of such a
reprocessing facility. KEPCO has already assigned inspectors to assist with JNFL’s
oversight and inspection and it plans to train more specialists.

Second, from FY2027-FY2029, about 200 tons of the spent nuclear fuel will be sent to
France’s nuclear fuel cycle company Orano for research on reprocessing spent MOX
(mixed oxide) fuel, specifically to see if MOX can be reprocessed in a sufficiently cost
effective way that makes commercial sense.


Thirdly, KEPCO plans to begin use of a yet-to-be-determined mid-term storage facility
by 2030. Until it becomes operational, the company intends to minimize the storage
volume of spent nuclear fuel at its plants by adopting the two aforementioned
strategies.

Also, studies are underway for a possible mid-term storage in Kaminoseki (Yamaguchi
Prefecture). This will be a collaboration between KEPCO and Chugoku Electric, which
needs a solution for spent nuclear fuel from Shimane NPP, whose Unit 2 last year
received the green light for restart. A final decision on this facility's location has not
yet been made.

Half-kept promises and Japan’s nuclear strategy
Since October 13 when Governor Sugimoto Tatsuji of Fukui Prefecture approved
KEPCO’s amended strategy for disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the company can now
extend operations of its three local reactors that have been running for over 40 years.
This decision, however, has incited a backlash from the regional legislature.

The plan looks overly optimistic, and many are concerned that it lacks a concrete
proposal for a location for the temporary storage facility. While the company
reaffirmed its commitment to find a location and begin operation by 2030, there are
fears that the spent nuclear fuel will remain within the prefecture for many years to
come.

25



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The central element of KEPCO’s plan – the Rokkasho reprocessing plant – has been
repeatedly delayed for 25 years. Compounding the problem is that the NRA’s
Chairman Yamanaka says that the review of the Rokkasho plant does not have a set
finish date, since the facility must undergo additional upgrades before completion.

Meanwhile, KEPCO has sought approval from the NRA to extend the lifespan of
Takahama NPP’s No. 1 reactor, the country's oldest, beyond its 50-year operational
limit set for November 2024. The company wants to have the reactor operating up to
its 60th year.

The challenges faced by KEPCO and the entire nuclear industry in managing spent
nuclear fuel are emblematic of a larger issue that casts a shadow over Japan’s
ambition to revitalize its nuclear sector. The complex plans and deferred deadlines for
dealing with nuclear waste are undermining the national strategy to reinvigorate the
nuclear industry at a moment when Japan desperately needs to increase carbon-free
power generation capacity.

Moreover, KEPCO’s apparent disconnect between the company's promises and
fulfillment of its commitments does little to foster local acceptance of nuclear policy. If
Japan will successfully navigate the sensitive path of nuclear energy reliance, then it
must demonstrate more effective, transparent, and timely strategies for spent fuel
management that align with the safety concerns and expectations of local
communities and stakeholders.

ANALYSIS

BY ANDREW STATTER

Jobs in Japan: Non-compete Clauses, Do They Hold Up?
Non-compete, non-scout, confidentiality and ‘garden leave’ clauses appear in
employment contracts worldwide, and Japan is no exception. How valid are these
clauses in the Japanese market? What can companies do to protect their trade secrets
and confidential information? And should employees be concerned about having such
clauses in their employment contracts?


Employee protection is favored
Generally speaking, employees in Japan are very well protected, and both laws and
courts tend to lean toward protecting the rights of individuals rather than the
company. This stance is also seen when looking at dismissals, Japan is a notoriously
hard market to fire people and companies must take clear steps toward dismissal with
a verifiable paper trail. This is the opposite of Taiwan, where typically courts will rule in
favor of protecting company interests.

As the Japanese constitution gives individuals the right to choose their job and
employer freely, it requires a very clear and well-structured case for a company to
restrict an employee from working for a competitor once their employment is
terminated.

According to a publication on the topic by Nishimura & Asahi (1), the company will
need to prove a clear necessity to restrict an employee from joining a competitor to
protect the company’s interests. Key points that are considered by a Japanese court
will be:

•  Nature, specificity, validity and depth of the proprietary information/trade
secrets that the employee has access to.
•  The position and seniority of the employee in question.
•  Regional scope and duration of time of limitation to be imposed.
•  Clear scope on what activities are prohibited, and with which parties such
activities are limited.
•  Importantly, the compensation that the company will pay the employee post-
employment for bearing the restrictions.

As with many laws and regulations in Japan, the lines are not black and white, and are
rather opaque and open to interpretation. Generally, wide and vague non-competes
without a clear definition on the scope of activities to be limited tend not to be
upheld. Another key point to consider is that non-competes which don’t clearly
specify a time period and a compensation structure during also tend to rule in favor of
the employee.


The first and second points are also key to consider when deciding whether to try and
enforce a non-compete or let the employee leave to a competitor unchallenged. For
example, a senior leader in your firm who is leaving to a competitor in the same
tender bid or RFP process, and could therefore clearly cause a loss of business, will be

27



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

much easier to enforce than a more mid-level employee leaving after said tender bid
or RFP is submitted or won.

Points for employers on non-compete clauses
Be specific. A broad brush, one size fits all non-compete will fail to hold up more often
than it will be upheld. Ensure that the length of ‘garden leave’, and compensation
offered during that period are clearly stated in the employment contract as well,
because omitting this is one of the leading causes of a non-compete being declared
out of line with labor law and/or constitution.

Review and update non-compete clauses as employees move into new, and more
senior positions in your company. The scope that was covered when a person was in
charge of early stage project development will be significantly different from the
scope if they are promoted to lead a competitive project bid.

Keep other clauses designed to protect your business separate from the non-
compete. Data protection, confidentiality, non-scout, intellectual property clauses,
etc, do not have the same protections from the Japanese constitution and therefore
are highly enforceable.

https://www.nishimura.com/sites/default/files/images/80459.pdf


Points for employees looking to leave
Look at how specific your non-compete is, and consider the nature, specificity, depth
of competitive information you currently possess, and how much potential damage it
could cause your current employer at this given moment in time. Check for specifics
on ‘garden leave’ and compensation, as this may affect enforceability. If you’re not
sure, take the time to consult with a labor lawyer.

Don’t sign anything new! It’s quite common that once you hand in your resignation,
the company wishes to enforce the non-compete. However, they are aware that in
most cases, what’s written in your employment contract is too broad, vague and will
not stand up in court. Often in these cases the company will bring a new, much more
strongly structured non-compete to the table and attempt to have you sign and agree
to this. You have no obligation to sign this, and bear in mind that if you do, that new
document will be used against you if the case proceeds to legal action. In many cases
it is advisable to sign nothing new, as the original non-compete is likely weaker than
what the company produces at resignation timing.

Ignore cease and desist letters. Before taking legal action, a company or their legal
firm may send you a letter threatening legal action. They may or may not follow
through, this is very much case by case, however by responding to such letters you
are acknowledging receipt, and depending on your response, may be providing
evidence that you are knowingly violating a legal obligation. Bottom line, if they are
going to take legal action, it will happen anyway, so don’t give them anything else to
build a case against you.

Don’t poke the bear. Generally speaking, it’s hard for your ex-employer to stop you
working at the new employer. On the other hand, it’s much easier for them to chase
you for poaching employees, customer accounts, or using competitive information

28



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

against them. Same as your ex-girlfriend can’t really stop you dating her friend, but
she can certainly sue you for stealing her belongings on the way out the door!

Bottom line: Talk to a professional
As mentioned above, labor law, like many regulations in Japan, is opaque and open
to interpretation. Though in most cases a general non-compete won’t be easily
enforceable, there are cases where you can protect your company’s interests and will
have a court rule in your favor. Also, in most cases the threats upon exit from a
company are more bark than bite, there are cases where due to legitimate business or
even personal reasons a company will aggressively look to uphold a non-compete or
other protectionist clauses.

Demand for oil and natural gas, especially LNG, will stay strong for decades, driven by
population growth and industrialization in economies across Asia, said Woodside
Energy CEO Meg O’Neill. Asian countries will secure fossil fuel supplies as they
simultaneously boost renewables in their power mix.

Indonesia / CCS
ExxonMobil will invest up to $15 billion in a petrochemical project and carbon capture
and storage (CCS) facilities in Indonesia. Also, Exxon and Indonesia’s Pertamina
agreed to evaluate $2 billion in CCS using two underground basins in the Java Sea. It
would store at least 3 gigatons of CO2 emitted by industries in Indonesia and the
region.

Indonesia / Floating solar
President Widodo inaugurated a 192 MW floating solar power plant on a reservoir in
West Java. The $109 million project was developed by PLN Nusantara Power, a unit
of Indonesia's state utility PLN.

Indonesia / Renewable power
State utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) plans to build an additional 31.6 GW of
renewable power capacity between 2024 and 2033. This would represent 75% of the
additional generation for the period, while the remaining capacity is expected to
come from natural gas power plants.

LNG exports
North American LNG exports will more than double by 2027 to meet growing Asian
demand. There are a total of 10 new projects in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.;
production will expand to 24.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) from the current 11.4
Bcf/d, as Mexico and Canada start their first LNG export terminals and the U.S. adds
to existing LNG capacity.

LNG transport
Shipping of LNG from the U.S. to Asia is now more expensive due to increased
transportation costs. The Panama Canal, through which much LNG travels from the
Gulf coast to Asia, plans to reduce the number of slots due to a severe drought, as
2023 ranks as the second driest year.

Philippines / Nuclear power
Major power distributor Manila Electric will work with U.S.-based Ultra Safe Nuclear
Corp to explore setting up small nuclear reactors. The two companies will undertake a
pre-feasibility study to use micro-modular reactors, in which they will estimate the
environmental impact, investment and operating costs.

SAF
Addressing the Assembly of Presidents of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines,
Subhash Menon said a global framework that enables the cost-effective supply of
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is crucial for aviation to attain its net zero emissions
goal by 2050. He called on governments, fuel producers, airports, etc to work
together.

Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels, which contributed 83% of its
energy mix in 2020; just 14.2% came from renewables, according to the ASEAN
Center for Energy. Unless governments introduce green policy initiatives, fossil fuels
could account for 88% of the region’s energy supply by 2050.
