NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY




Government considers emissions quotas, carbon tax
(Nikkei, Dec. 27)
•  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is preparing to start charging carbon emitters, in a
bid to achieve its pledge of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.
•  While the government has thus far concentrated on technological innovations and greater use of
nuclear energy as a way of achieving its goal, it believes that technological innovations alone will

not be enough.
•  Senior officials at the Ministry of Finance have stated the opinion that until a system of quotas or
carbon taxes are imposed, big corporations will not make any effort to cut their emissions.
•  The government will now decide whether the new regulations should take the form of a carbon tax,
or a system of emissions quotas with penalties for exceeding those quotas.
•  Several companies including Fujitsu and Ricoh have been calling on the government to introduce
carbon pricing since 2018, saying that such a system is essential in order to improve the

competitiveness of Japanese corporations internationally, even if it entails increased cost in the
short term.



Green Ammonia Consortium aims to profit from green boom
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Dec. 30)
•  The Tokyo-based Green Ammonia Consortium aims to establish a supply chain for the distribution

in Japan of ammonia produced in the U.S. and Australia.
•  Ammonia can be blended with the coal burned by power stations to reduce their carbon
emissions. In future, there are also plans to build power stations fueled entirely by ammonia, and
even ammonia-fueled ships.
•  Established in 2019, the GAC has over 100 members from Japan and overseas.
•  In future, the GAC plans to expand manufacturing and supply chains, and to begin sourcing
ammonia from the Middle East and other new regions.
•  The GAC forecasts domestic ammonia demand of 3 million to 5 million metric tons annually by the

2030s.



Nippon Yusen to deliver cars to Europe by train to cut emissions
(Nikkei, Jan. 14)
•  Japanese marine shipper Nippon Yusen will send some of its exports by rail rather than sea freight

to cut carbon emissions. Later this year it will start transporting Japanese cars to Europe using
trains that cross mainland China.
•  Nippon Yusen has a partnership with a Chinese railway operator.
•  The Japanese firm can move cars by ship to the Chinese city of Dalian. From there, cargo will travel
through Altynkol in Kazakhstan, over a total distance of 5,000 km.

•  Until now, Nippon Yusen has been shipping cars from Japan to Turkey from where they enter
Europe.
•  The volume of autos that can be sent by rail is only half that of shipping. However, by rail it’s twice
as fast and carbon emissions are half.




Panasonic vows to develop cobalt-free battery
(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 13)
•  Co. aims to make cobalt-free batteries for Tesla’s electric vehicles in two to three years.
•  Cobalt is blamed for the high price of EV’s lithium-ion batteries, which account for 30%-40% of the
car’s cost. Cobalt is used in the cathode of lithium-ion batteries.

Mitsubishi Chemical to raise global battery liquid output by 50%
(Asia Nikkei, Jan. 13)
o  Co. to raise its global output of electrolyte solution for lithium-ion batteries by about 50%
to better compete with Chinese peers.
o  Co. to invest ¥1 billion to increase output. It already has a 20% global share in the battery

liquid material.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
China tightens rare-earth regulations including in exports
(Nikkei Asia, Jan. 16)
o  The draft of the new law seeks to review the entire industrial chain of China’s mining,
refining, product transport and export of important rare earth materials.

o  The new rules may limit China’s exports of these critical raw materials.
o  Japan wants to lower its reliance on Chinese imports of rare earths to 50% from 58% by
2025.
• TAKEAWAY: See the analysis section for a deep dive on this topic and its implications for Japan.



Environment Minister calls for changes to Akita offshore wind farm over ecological concerns

(Kankyo Business Online, Jan. 6)
•  The Environment Ministry has made a submission to METI on the environmental impact of an
offshore wind farm project planned for Akita prefecture.
•  The Environment Ministry is calling for changes to the Hihata 1 and Aramaki sections to reduce the
impact on swans and other migratory birds. Officials are very concerned about the impact on bird
populations from changes to migration routes and the availability of food.

Update on Japan’s power shortages due to cold weather and LNG price spike
(Japan NRG, Jan. 17)
•  Japan experienced a period of colder than average weather at the start of January. Snowfall in
southern parts of Japan was particularly unusual and hampered the use of solar power, as well as
other renewable generation, such as pumped storage hydro. It has led to power companies asking
business and individual consumers to limit electricity use for the first time since 2011, when a major
earthquake and tsunami struck, resulting in most of Japan’s nuclear capacity being taken offline.
•  With a jump in COVID-19 cases at the end of December, and the expected announcement of a
State of Emergency in parts of Japan, power utilities expected seasonal demand to be less than
usual and did not jump into the spot market late in 2020 to secure additional LNG cargos. The

result has been a spike in prices of LNG, and then electricity, to record levels.
•  Below is a selection of the most pertinent news stories on this issue, as well as some data on the
current load factor of power utilities.
• TAKEAWAY: Two factors signal that the original “power emergency” may be over. One is a return to milder
weather, with Tokyo, for example, seeing 16 degrees Celsius on Jan. 16. The second is the widening of the
govt.’s State of Emergency (i.e., lockdown) to around half the country, in terms of the economy and population

total. There is even talk of implementing the same for the entire nation, though Prime Minister Suga’s
government seems keen to avoid going to an extreme to minimize the economic impact.
• Admittedly, Japan’s lockdown, as detailed in the Jan. 12 edition of Japan NRG, is a mild version of measures
imposed in other countries. However, it’s having a pronounced impact on swathes of businesses, such as

restaurants and nightspots, all of which are closed from 8 p.m. We expect lockdown measures to last at least
until the official target of Feb. 7.
• It is clear that government and business discussions on what this power crunch means will continue for many
months to come. The following items will be under particular scrutiny in light of the recent “energy

emergency”:

Govt. sets ¥200/ kWh limit for imbalance fees, effectively placing cap on electricity spot price

(Japan NRG, Jan. 15)
•  On Jan. 15, METI announced the imbalance charge ceiling to begin from Jan. 17. The ministry said
the ceiling is made in light of electricity prices exceeding ¥200/ kWh on the spot market in recent
days and this has made it difficult for many market participants to procure power supply.
•  The ministry said this was an urgent measure needed to protect the market and ensure a “stable
electricity trading environment” that has a “degree of predictability”.
•  The rule will stay in place until June 30 this year.
•  CONTEXT: imbalance fee is charged when the amount of power supply doesn’t match the planned

demand submitted by retailers. The measure has indeed put a ceiling of ¥200 on the spot
electricity market as can be clear from intra-day pricing.

J-Power to run coal plant on fuel oil as power shortages bite
(Nikkei, Jan. 12)
•  J-Power is due to restart the out-of-service Matsushima coal-fired power station in Nagasaki as

early as Jan. 14 to combat fuel shortages.
•  The plant’s number two boiler has not been operational since Jan. 7 due to broken coal crushing
equipment. However, so dire are the current power shortages that J-Power will take the unusual
step of using fuel oil to fire the boiler.
• TAKEWAWAY: This is a very unusual move in that heavy oil tends to be used at such power plants to help with
combustion when the station is restarted following an inspection. This time, the plant is running on oil only.
Because of this and other factors, the plant is only able to work at about half its nameplate capacity of 500

MW.


Minister encourages efficient power use as cold snap causes shortages

(Tokyo Shimbun, Jan. 12)
•  On Jan. 12 Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry Kajiyama Hiroshi called on consumers to be
efficient in their electricity use in light of power shortages.
•  The Minister said he’s not asking people to reduce electricity use per se, since hard-hit areas can
be supplied with electricity from other regions. People can use heating normally, he said.



Kansai Electric pleads with consumers to conserve electricity

(NHK, Jan. 10)
•  On Jan. 10, the Kansai Electric Power Co. began calling on domestic and commercial subscribers
to reduce electricity use as cold weather causes power shortages.
•  KEPCO calls on consumers to turn off lights and reduce non-essential electricity use.
•  A large cold front saw demand for electricity in areas served by KEPCO hit record levels on Jan. 8.
Electricity use remains above 95% of capacity as of 9 a.m. on Jan. 10.
•  Recent LNG shortages, combined with the fact that KEPCO’s nuclear power stations are closed for

maintenance, means resources are likely to remain strained for some time.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan power utilities asks oil firms for supply to burn in power plants
(Nikkei, Jan. 16)
•  Power utilities all over the country are turning to the oil refineries such as ENEOS for help in
providing fuel oil that can be burned in some power plants.
•  Kansai Electric is among those in the most difficult situation needing to secure oil supplies.

•  Chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, Ikebe Kazuhiro, who is also
head of Kyushu Electric, told the media that several bad events have overlapped to cause the
current energy crisis and the situation remains unpredictable.

Why government doesn’t want to tell consumers to save power despite historic shortage
(Nikkei Business, Jan. 12)
•  Despite not having been afflicted by a nuclear accident or major earthquake, Japan currently finds

itself in the grips of its worst power shortage since the Fukushima disaster. Since Jan. 4, the
government has walked a tightrope as utilities barely manage to stave off power outages.
•  In an unprecedented move, on Jan. 6, the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of
Transmission Operators called on generators to crank up output to maximum levels and redirect all
surplus electricity to the wholesale market.
•  Power companies have called on subscribers to turn down their thermostats. However, sources in
the power industry say that METI is reluctant to make a similar plea over fear of criticism, in view of

the fact that the government recently declared a Covid-19 emergency. At a press conference on
Jan. 8, METI Ministry Kajiyama said he didn’t envisage asking the public to save power.



Electricity retailers fight for survival amid skyrocketing spot prices
(Diamond Online, Jan. 14)
•  The spot price for electricity traded on the wholesale market recorded a historical high of over
¥154 on Jan. 13, over eight times its level one year before.

•  CONTEXT: This is still the peak closing price for 24-hour day-ahead pricing as of Jan. 17.
•  Power retailers that lack their own generation capacity are burning through cash reserves as they
sell electricity to clients at a significant loss.
•  While the high prices are being blamed on an LNG shortage and cold weather, in reality, the
culprit is the business model underpinning the wholesale electricity market.
•  Industry insiders say exceptionally low spot prices in the first half of 2020 prompted many

electricity retailers to pull out of long-term contracts with JERA and other legacy generators and
source electricity on the spot market instead.
•  The COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to forecast LNG demand, and power generators
underestimated winter demand. At least one month is needed for any new LNG order to be
delivered.



Cold snap: TEPCO EP offers special terms to hard-hit regions

OPINION: Japan’s LNG dependence exposed and pivot to green power under question
(Nikkei, Jan. 13)
•  CONTEXT: the writer Matsuo Hirofumi is a senior staff at Nikkei Shimbun. This is presented as an

editorial.
•  The current energy crisis shows the challenges of decarbonization for Japan and the many
problems with the current energy system.
•  Peak load for many regions hit 99% at times, with a record 140 cases when a utility was instructed
to send power to a neighboring region to stave off shortages.
•  Japan’s reliance on LNG has been exposed with this crisis. It takes about two months to get a
cargo delivered from time of purchase. But, Japan has only two weeks of LNG storage built into

the system.
•  Oil-burning plants are less clean and more expensive, but oil can be stored for many months. It is
also much easier and quicker to procure and transport.
•  As the government has pushed for liberalization in the power market, oil-fueled power plants with
high fixed costs and low-capacity factors were decommissioned one after another.
•  A long-standing concern has materialized: Liberalizing the power markets is making it difficult to
maintain generation capacity.
•  The intermittency of renewable energy has also been shown up in this crisis as the situation in

Kyushu region exemplified. Available solar power capacity dropped 42% during the cold snap, the
equivalent of two nuclear reactors. Also, this solar capacity is often used to power pumped storage
hydro. The lack of solar made it unusable.
•  Japan has focused its energy policy discussions too much on zero-carbon aspirations and market
liberalization. There needs to more thought about stable supply and how to meet that at minimum
cost.

•  LNG plants also need to become more resilient and the grid needs to be restructured to make the
national system more flexible.



Pipe damage found at Kansai Electric’s Takahama nuclear plant

(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 15)
•  KEPCO said on Jan. 14 that a scheduled inspection of the No. 4 reactor at the Takahama nuclear
power plant had found damage to steam generator infrastructure. It appears that iron oxide scale
has compromised the network of pipes that transport heat from the generator.
•  The age of the plant is believed to be a factor.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kansai Electric not learning from its nuclear mistakes

(President, Jan. 11)
o  Kansai Electric (KEPCO) is known for being highly reliant on nuclear power plants (NPP),
and has made the restarting of its three Fukui NPPs a top priority.
o  CEO Morimoto’s indecisiveness on the issue of finding storage locations for nuclear
waste, however, could mean the company finds itself in crisis.
o  After 11th-hour negotiations between METI and the Federation of Electric Power
Companies, it was proposed that KEPCO could share a new interim storage facility being

built in Mutsu (Aomori).

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  However, the enthusiasm expressed by Morimoto about sending waste to Mutsu has
attracted criticism from within the Federation and KEPCO itself. Insiders say Morimoto
showed his true colors with the remark.
o  The statement sparked fierce protests from Mutsu officials, who accuse KEPCO of using
its Federation membership as a back-door way of forcing its waste on the area. Mutsu

officials say KEPCO has not directly informed the municipality of its intentions. KEPCO’s
attitude is completely unacceptable, they say.
o  This is not the first time KEPCO has angered the Aomori government. Back in 2017, then
CEO Iwane told Mustu officials that KEPCO would have a long-term plan in place for
dealing with its spent nuclear fuel by the end of 2018. When no plan eventuated, Iwane
was forced to apologize to the governor of Aomori.




Kansai Electric’s Ohi No. 4 nuclear reactor to go fully online on Jan. 17
(Denki Shimbun, Jan. 15)
•  KEPCO says the 1.2 GW Unit 4 at the Ohi nuclear power plant will be restarted on Jan. 15 and
begin supplying electricity to the grid on Jan. 17.
•  It is hoped that restarting the reactor will help alleviate the current electricity shortage.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Residents call for suspension of Ohi permit
(Mainichi Shimbun, Jan. 15)
•  In a bid to force the shutdown of Units 3 and 4 at the Ohi NPP, the group of Fukui residents that
successfully petitioned for the revocation of the original restart permit granted by the Nuclear
Regulation Authority has now filed a petition demanding that the force of the permit be suspended
until after the appeal process has concluded.




JERA Energy Taiwan drumming up business

Japan’s Green Tech Plans Face Critical Raw Material Issues

Along with dozens of other countries, in 2020 Japan committed to achieve net-zero in
greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. Japan’s decarbonization pledge is backed up by
ambitions for a vast rollout of offshore wind, millions of tons of green hydrogen, and
assertions that domestic automakers can establish net-zero emissions from the entire
life cycle of a vehicle.

Japan may yet possess the innovative capacity to realize these goals. But one
pertinent question is whether resource-scarce Japan has access to sufficient critical
materials to make it happen. Equally important is asking whether Japan has a strategy
to secure critical raw materials that conform to rapidly diffusing sustainability rules.


It’s a Material World
Concerns about decarbonization’s material demand went mainstream at the start of
this year. On January 11, the International Energy Agency (IEA) announced a series of
special projects for 2021, leading up to the May 18 release of The World’s Roadmap
to Net Zero by 2050. Key among the IEA special reports will be what IEA director
Fatih Birol correctly described as the first comprehensive and global study of the
supply constraints, lifecycle costs, environmental justice, and related challenges
confronting critical minerals used in electric vehicles, renewable energy equipment,
and the myriad other elements of the clean energy transition. This IEA special report is
tentatively titled The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions, and is
slated for publication in April.

According to Birol, copper, nickel, cobalt and rare earth metals will feature among the
critical minerals under the IEA’s review. However, that itemization is not exhaustive.
What constitutes a “critical raw material” (CRM) varies by country and is based on
domestic economic importance, supply risk and related factors. The most recent CRM
list from Australia contains 24 materials. As of 2018, the U.S. identifies 35 CRMs. And
Japan’s list comprises 34 CRMs, up from 30 in 2012.

Interestingly, what is deemed a critical resource has largely evolved and expanded in
line with the expansion of green energy. The EU is a notable example of this
phenomenon. Its triennial review of CRMs identified 14 materials in 2014. As
investments in renewable energy and other green tech have soared, the EU’s CRM list
has ballooned. By 2017, it contained 27 materials. Last September, the number had
grown to 30.

While most CRM lists converge on rare earths, cobalt, graphite, indium, and lithium,
the view on other materials differs. For example, Japan has long determined copper
to be critical, whereas the EU, U.S., Canada and Australia do not. Yet the global take
on copper is rapidly moving closer to Japan’s position. Many experts and analysts are

15


CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

re-evaluating copper’s core contribution in the renewables space and – as Wood
Mackenzie does - ranking it alongside aluminum, nickel, cobalt and lithium as an
“energy transition metal.”


Driving concerns
There are several drivers for this deepening convergence of concern regarding CRMs.
One is the rapidly increasing global commitment to “green deal,” “green recovery,”
and similarly named transformative policies to “build back better” from the ravages of
COVID-19. These policies are imperative lest China’s currently carbon-intensive
recovery become the norm.

However, implementing the “green” future in power, mobility and other industries is
not done via intangible new technologies and innovation. Greening requires a
dramatically different mix of raw materials than what composes the grey, or carbon-
intensive economy and society. For example, as seen in figure 1, data from a March
2020 IEA report indicate that building offshore wind capacity is well over ten times
more copper-intensive than natural-gas and coal-fired fossil-fuel plant.

As for mobility, the same IEA publication points out that electric vehicles require
roughly five times as much CRM as a conventional car.

Figure 1: Minerals used in selected power generation technologies

















Source: IEA, 2020

Another driver of growing concern over CRMs supply is that no one is minding the
store. The policy environment is in flux, the knowledge base concerning CRMs mining
and processing is poor, and there are wildly optimistic assumptions regarding
substitutability and recycling. Hence, our precarious present, where green-energy
scenarios of “overbuild” and “electrify everything” assume a cornucopia of CRMs that
analysts realize doesn’t exist.

Indeed, experts on the realities of lithium mining warn that battery-maker and other
firms’ current planning for 2023 implies eight times more demand than any
conceivable scenario for global supply.

Japan’s supply-chain vulnerabilities
A more long-term set of issues for Japan, in particular, are supply-chain vulnerabilities.
The country has had strong trade ties but, at times, a rocky political relationship with
neighboring China. And yet, 58% of Japan’s rare earth imports came from China in
2019, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ “China Power”
project.

China dominates the mining and processing of CRMs. Last month, Japan’s Ministry of
the Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated in its vision for the domestic offshore
wind industry that Japan must aim to produce at least 60% of components locally in
order to cut costs. At present, the viability of this goal depends heavily on China’s
interest in continuing to export a large share of its CRMs to Japanese manufacturers.
As the story of photovoltaic panels shows, that is not a given. The photovoltaic sector,
once led by Japanese firms, is now dominated by Chinese peers.

Over the last decade, Japan has somewhat diversified its rare earths supply, wary of
China’s demonstrated capacity to restrict exports. Yet as we see in Figure 2, a 2020
report from the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) warns that
China enjoys a continued monopoly in the separation and purification of rare earths.
One reason is that China’s ability to bear the enormous environmental damage from
mining and purifying rare earths allows it to weaken the investment incentives of
would-be competitors.

Figure 2: Risks in the rare earths supply chain














Source: JOGMEC, 2020

What’s more, extracting and processing rare earths and other CRMs is very energy-
intensive, with massive carbon footprints when undertaken in locales dependent on
fossil-fuels, as China still is.

However, things are changing. The coal-fired power and lax environmental regulations
that have helped make China a formidable player in CRMs, and by extension a major
factor affecting Japan’s manufacturing and energy strategies, may soon work against
it.

One major reason is the striking rise in prominence of environmental, social and
governance (ESG) rules. These rules are now forcing firms to forego the business-as-
usual approach in securing CRMs and obligating them to accept responsibility for the

17


CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

lifecycle environmental cost of products.

The upshot is that a Japanese manufacturer of, say, wind power equipment will need
to factor in the additional “cost” of the environmental impacts of the CRMs they
import. Put simply, in the choice between a bar of metal produced with clean energy
and another with dirty energy, the former will become more attractive. At the very
least, the cost of the metal will be assessed in terms of both production costs and ESG
impacts. The resulting all-in cost may in time also include an emissions tax and similar
measures.

This new trajectory of competition and price-discovery is already emerging in certain
energy fields, such as LNG. Producers are being encouraged to offer carbon offsets as
part of the sale, anticipating compulsory rules.

Similar trends are already emerging in the CRM space – not in spite of, but precisely
because of the strategic importance of these materials.

Whither Japan?
As it stands, Japan’s laudable zero-carbon ambitions effectively commit it to a massive
increase in imported CRMs. To date, resource-poor Japan has emphasized CRM
recycling and substitution. But as the IEA and other initiatives show, those strategies
are buckshot rather than silver-bullet solutions.

Japan has a weak mining industry, and will have to secure much larger volumes of
CRMs in the midst of increasing resource nationalism, worsening ore-grades, and
other complications. At the same time, life-cycle emission commitments will push
Japan to be choosy: if it fails to procure ESG-conforming “green CRMs” rather than
the environmentally costly “gray CRMs” that it currently sources, it risks forfeiting
business in the midst of history’s biggest energy revolution.

Through its purchasing power, Japan finally has the chance to lead on CRMs - to be a
rule-maker rather than a rule-taker. So far, Japan’s domestic resource and energy-
environmental policy debates have yet to grapple with the dilemmas. But the IEA’s
new initiative tells us this complacency has a short shelf life.

Symbol of Japan’s “Old Energy” Engineering Excellence
Seeks to Reinvent Itself for the Green Energy Age

For most of the 20th century, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) was a stalwart of
Japan’s shipping, aviation, and energy industries. It built the nation’s top jets, excelled
in defense and commercial ships, and propelled Japanese rockets into space. In the
energy sector, MHI crafted many of Japan’s top-selling gas and steam turbines,
developed nuclear reactors, and produced ships to carry LNG, LPG and oil.

When the shift to renewables first started in earnest, MHI again sought to be at the
forefront. By the early 2010s, it had developed the world’s top wind turbine by
capacity and joined forces with a leading European wind power manufacturer, Vestas.
And yet, a decade on, MHI’s pivot to green-age energy has yet to really take off, while
its core business lines are badly underperforming. For Japan to meet its 2050
decarbonization commitments, its engineering powerhouse will need to turn things
around and soon.

Last year was one to forget for MHI. The engineering conglomerate expected to turn
things around after posting its first loss in two decades in 2019. Instead, losses
mounted, spreading from its now-frozen Mitsubishi Regional Jet project to other core
busines pillars. In a bullish year for Japanese stocks, MHI shares dropped 26%.

Crimped ambitions in the wind power market
Having contributed 39% of MHI’s total revenues in FY2019, Energy Systems is the
company’s second largest business unit. Among other things, it includes production of
gas-turbine combined cycle and nuclear power plants, wind turbines, and aircraft
engine parts.

As the nuclear industry in Japan has floundered and nuclear export ambitions waned,
Energy System saw profits turn to a loss. The segment had a ¥12.4 billion loss in
1H2020, with lower sales of steam power and aircraft engines also contributing.
More disappointing, perhaps, were the dim results of MHI’s wind power ambitions.
Between FY2011 and FY2018, MHI participated in the Fukushima Offshore Wind
Consortium, which included nine other private companies and universities in Japan.
The METI-subsidized demonstration project sought to build the case for commercial
floating offshore facilities in Japan, based on homegrown technology. After the
Fukushima nuclear disaster, it was also a symbolic move to help rebuild Fukushima
prefecture as a beacon for renewable energy.

The consortium installed three sets of turbines off the coast of Fukushima: 2 MW, 5
MW, and 7 MW capacity turbines. Of the first two, made by Hitachi, only one, the
smallest, reached the target capacity factor of 30%. MHI was responsible for the 7
MW model. It performed the worst of the three, operating at just 2% capacity due to
issues with the turbine’s hydraulic system.

19

Luckily for MHI, it had hedged its wind ambitions by partnering with Denmark’s Vestas
in 2014. The Danish firm was on the brink of bankruptcy and MHI promised to work as
equals in the 50-50 JV with its European partner.
Six years later and it’s the Danish partner rescuing MHI’s wind business. While MHI
expected the MHI Vestas JV to help it gain valuable know-how in the off-shore wind
turbine business, the majority of the ¥850 billion order pipeline that Vestas brought to
the venture was from projects in Europe (and thus served by Vestas-manufactured
turbines). MHI failed to generate any
significant business for the JV in Japan.

With that, in November 2020, Mitsubishi
Heavy announced that it will terminate the
development of its own wind turbines and
dissolve the MHI Vestas joint-venture. As
part of the dissolution, however, MHI
became a Vestas shareholder, taking a
2.5% stake. Those shares are now worth
about $1.2 billion.

Trouble in traditional energy markets

MHI’s struggles in energy are not limited
to the wind power market. The
conglomerate has seen COVID-19 hurt
demand across a number of industrial and
infrastructure projects. It has also delayed
a planned exit from LNG tanker

production, announced in December 2019.
MHI planned to sell one of its shipyards to Oshima Shipbuilding, Japan’s third-largest
shipbuilder, by March 2020. This did not happen and a revised schedule for the sale
remains unknown.
The October announcement by Prime Minister Suga that pledged to make Japan
emissions net-zero by 2050 also casts doubt on MHI’s turbines business, much of
which has been molded around thermal and nuclear power facilities. The nation’s
decarbonization commitment looks set to strongly reduce demand for new thermal
power capacity, while new nuclear plant construction is not on the agenda, according
to Suga’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Kato.


A green turnaround?
By the end the year, MHI set out a plan to reorient its energy products to green
energy. On November 26, 2020, MHI announced an “Energy Transition Strategy,”
part of which involves investing ¥90 billion in energy transition-related projects over
the next three years. By FY2023, the company aims for this segment to contribute ¥50
billion to total revenues, and it expects that amount to increase to ¥300 billion yen in
FY2030.

As part of the new initiative, MHI plans to offer services that improve efficiency at gas
and coal co-firing power plants, to develop turbines for hydrogen co-firing plants, and
to invest in CO2 recovery and utilization technologies.


20


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The company also expressed interest in investing in hydrogen and ammonia
production projects, starting by acquiring a stake in Australia’s H2U Investments.
While domestic peer Kawasaki Heavy Industries has said it will sell all of its domestic
nuclear business, MHI is not giving up on that segment. MHI said it believes it can
grow its nuclear business by supporting the restart of Japan’s existing reactors and by
developing technologies to produce clean hydrogen using nuclear power. Also, MHI
says it plans to design a safer next-generation light water reactor.

With the levelized cost of electricity from nuclear rising from around $117/ MWh in
2015 to $155/ MWh at the end of 2019, and the world looking to shift from fossil fuel-
burning power plants to renewables, MHI’s strategy seems risky. Its core emphasis
remains on co-firing and nuclear.
Still, MHI’s focus also happens to be in line with the Japanese government’s focus on
strengthening infrastructure exports as part of its “Infrastructure System Export
Strategy.” What’s more, the conglomerate might finally turn around its fortunes in
wind power after the government recently announced a target requiring at least 60%
of offshore wind components to be made domestically.

MHI is also making headway in carbon capture, a technology for which the
government and industry have particularly high expectations. In Sept. 2020, MHI
began trials of carbon capture at a biomass power station in the U.K. operated by
Drax Group. The target is to combine plant-based fuel and carbon capture to report
negative net emissions.
MHI has already delivered 14 carbon capture facilities globally and has worked on this
technology since the 1990s.

At the end of 2020, MHI issued so-called green bonds for the first time. The ¥25
billion amount is not small, but more than the money, it indicates the direction of the
engineering conglomerate. MHI has said it will use the proceeds to support wind,
hydrogen, and geothermal power projects.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

LNG:
Extreme volatility in LNG pricing due to a record half-century plunge in temperatures
in China, South Korea, and Japan saw LNG delivery prices rise to almost $40 mmbtu
from a low of $2 mmbtu one year ago.

Oil:
1). Exxon is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
following an employee’s whistle-blower complaint for overvaluing one of its most
important oil and gas holdings in the Permian Basin.

2). OPEC issued its latest global oil demand forecast for 2021 on Thursday showing
consumption increasing by 5.9 mbpd YoY to average 96 mbpd in 2021.

Climate:
Copernicus, the EU monitoring center, has reported 2020 as the joint hottest year on
record, along with 2016. In June 2020, temperatures of 38 Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit)
were recorded in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk in the Sakha Republic, which lies
inside the Arctic Circle and is otherwise known as one of the coldest places on Earth.

ESG:
HSBC investors, Amundi and Man Group, have criticized the bank for fossil fuel
financing activities and have filed a climate resolution ahead of the April HSBC AGM.

Hydropower:
1). Negotiations between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt over the 4 GW Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile broke down last week. Ethiopia had commenced
filling the dam in July 2020.

2). China!s decision to hold back the Mekong River’s water flow by almost 50% at the
Jinghong Hydropower Station dam for close to a month, until Jan. 24, has been
criticized by Thai and Laos interest groups and could impact the livelihoods of up to
60 million people. The reason for the reduced water discharge was attributed to
maintenance for power grid transmission lines.

EVs:
1). GM will launch a new electric-truck business focused on delivery services.

2). Tesla faces a 158,000 vehicle recall in the U.S. for its Model S and Model X sports
utility models due to defects with its touch screen technology.

China:
1). The U.S. government has sanctioned CNOOC officials for harassing and
threatening Vietnamese oil and gas exploration and extraction facilities in the South
China Sea, although the sanctions don’t impact oil or natural gas trade.

2). China has placed travel restrictions on 23 million residents of Shijiazhuang, Xingtai
and Lanfang in Hebei Province due to virus outbreaks, potentially stalling the
country’s improving energy consumption. The World Bank now estimates that
pandemic will cost the global economy more than $10 trillion in lost output in 2020
and 2021.

South Korea:
1). The share price of Hyundai Motor has soared over 25% since the publication of a
report that it would sign an agreement with Apple to manufacture autonomous EVs.

2). Deputy Foreign Minister Choi Jong-Kun of South Korea (‘RoK’) has asked Qatar for
“maximum support” to secure the release of the Hankuk Chemi oil tanker seized by
Iran on Jan. 4 near Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Choi visited Qatar from Tehran after
talks with Iranian officials failed to secure the release of RoK sailors or the tanker.

Taiwan:
U.S. ambassador to U.N., Kelly Craft, abruptly cancelled a trip to Taiwan on
Wednesday. The scheduled trip followed the announcement by the U.S. State
Department that it would remove multi-year restrictions on engagement with
Taiwanese diplomats. The announcement is thought to have infuriated China,
potentially raising tensions in the seas around Taiwan.

Indonesia:
The 6.2 earthquake on Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday caused significant power
outages in West Sulawesi, which has a population of 15 million.

Australia:
Shell resumed LNG cargoes from its Prelude FLNG facility following a one-year
technical disruption at the Browse Basin facility in Western Australia. The FLNG
structure is estimated to have cost $13 billion and Japan’s INPEX holds a 17.5% stake
in the project.

Kyrgyzstan:
Sadyr Japarov was elected president on Jan. 10 in a move welcomed by China and
Russia. Russia is the major supplier of oil and gas with Gazprom operating the
country’s gas network. Hydro and coal are the major sources of electricity and the
country is thought to have $2 billion of Chinese debt coming due soon. Shinzo Abe
was the first Japanese prime minister to ever visit the country in 2015. The U.S.
embassy in Bishkek has not yet issued any comments on Japarov’s election.

Saudia Arabia:
1). The Saudi government launched the initiative, “Programme HQ”, to lure large oil
services companies from Dubai to Riyadh. Inducements include a 50-year tax holiday.

2). The country also announced $40 billion of spending over five years by the Public
Investment Fund on two futuristic projects on the Red Sea including one at Neom.
Iran:
1). Iran announced it will produce material from uranium used in nuclear warheads.

This followed an announcement earlier in the month about uranium enrichment levels
and stockpiles of low-enriched uranium, all of which exceed levels in the 2015 nuclear

2). Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned all Covid-19 vaccines from the U.S. and the U.K.
Iran is thought to have 1.3 million infections and has suffered 56,000 fatalities.

Africa:
The African Development Bank has committed $14 billion to build the ‘Great Green
Wall’ project that will plant vegetation along an 8,000 km route across the Sahel from
Senegal to Djibouti.

Turkey/Greece:
Both governments will meet in Istanbul on Jan. 25 to discuss oil and gas territorial
disputes in the Aegean and the East Mediterranean. France had sent a military frigate
to the region in August to back Greece’s claims after Greek and Turkish frigates
collided.

Germany:
Armin Laschet was elected leader of the ruling CDU party on Saturday making him
favorite to replace Angela Merkel as German chancellor after the federal election on
Sept. 26. He is currently prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, which borders
Holland and Belgium, and has been a member of the Bundestag since 1994 and is a
committed European. There is likely to be no change in Germany’s policy of energy
engagement with Russia or Germany’s 11 commercial engagement with China.

Mexico:
Pemex, the state oil monopoly, is facing a cash crunch due to low oil prices and a
$110 billion debt mountain. It was forced to raise almost $5 billion from a
government-refinancing program to meet a $2 billion debt repayment due this month.

Brazil:
Ford will cease auto manufacturing in Brazil with the loss of 5,000 jobs. The company
is expected to lose almost $400m in South America in 2020.

United States:
1). In Texas output from wind energy exceeded output from coal projects for the first
time ever in 2020. Wind output reached one quarter of total Texan output, with coal
at 18%.

2). The operator of the Millennium Bulk Terminal coal project on the Columbia River in
Washington State filed for bankruptcy last month. The project was meant to ship coal
from the Power River Basin in Wyoming and Montana to Asia.

3). U.S. GHG emissions fell by 10% YoY in 2020, falling below 5.5 billion tons for the
first time since the 1980.

4). Toyota paid a $180 million fine for breaching EPA reporting requirements.
