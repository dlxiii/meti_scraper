Tokyo GX Week to start on Sept 26
(Government Statement, Aug. 1)
•  Tokyo GX Week, renamed from the previous Tokyo Beyond Zero Week, will run from Sept. 26 to
Oct. 7. In addition to conferences on carbon neutrality covering natural gas, carbon recycling,
hydrogen, ammonia, CCUS, financing and renewables, an inaugural conference on green
transformation (GX) will be held on Oct. 7. The LNG producer consumer conference, now in its 11th

year, will be held on Sept. 29; hydrogen ministers meeting on Sept. 26; ammonia conference on
Sept. 28; and Asia green growth partnership ministers meeting on Sept. 26.



State agency plans for fast reactors to be operational in the 2040s
(Aug. 1, Denki Shimbun)
•  Later this year, the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy will launch the Assessment

Committee for Fast Reactor Technology, and will look at the merits and challenges in putting fast
reactors into use in the 2040s.
•  In December 2018, the Agency released a 10 year-term Strategy Roadmap for Fast Reactors.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s official position is “There is neither a plan to replace nor build new nuclear reactors
locally”. However, METI has already started work on developing fast reactors that could be ready in the 2040s.
This might indicate that below the surface, the country is moving to restore its nuclear industry. This would be
one reason PM Kishida has appointed the METI Minister Hagiuda to also serve as the Green Transformation

(GX) minister. See the Analysis section for a deeper look at this issue from a policy perspective.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mitsubishi micro reactor could run for 25 years without refueling

(Nikkei X-Tech, June 10)
o  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is developing a “micro reactor” that is a mere two meters
long and 1 meter in diameter. It won’t use a liquid coolant.
o  The reactor will generate around 500 kW of electricity – over 1000 times less than the
output of a typical nuclear reactor. It will be able to run for 25 years without refueling.
o  The reactor should be in service by around 2040, and says applications could include
emergency backup and power supplies for isolated regions.

Discussion on hydrogen safety rules begins
(Japan NRG, Aug. 5)
•  METI launched a panel to set hydrogen safety rules and standards, now spread out among laws on
high-pressure gas safety, gas and electricity businesses. The regulatory framework was aimed for

fuel cell vehicles, and a major revamp is required to cover the entire hydrogen supply chain from
production, transport, storage and consumption.
•  The panel, headed by Yokohama State University professor Miyake Atsumi, will compile an
advisory report by February 2023.
•  Japanese regulation covers gas that measures over 1 MPa of pressure, while the threshold is over 3
MPa in other countries. Several experts said that Japan’s and overseas safety standards need to

synchronize for efficiency.
•  CONTEXT: Many hydrogen pilot projects involving Japanese companies are held overseas
because of tight regulations at home. For example, Japan’s current rules mandate that the
distance between hydrogen storage bases and power generating facilities should be twice that
used for LNG storage bases, which is not realistic. Also, hydrogen power generation units need to
station three certified engineers, which constrain operators that want to set up smaller stations
across multiple locations.
•  Regulations should aim to prevent massive hydrogen leakage and other incidents, and identify

other priority safety issues. The present rules spread out among several regulatory frameworks
need to be streamlined, panel members also said.
•  CONTEXT: Around 700 tons/ year of hydrogen are supplied to fuel cell vehicle service stations.
While it’s clear that demand will grow rapidly, METI said the challenges of setting safety rules can’t
depend on analysis of past incidents but need to build scenarios on forecasts. On the other hand,
METI is keen to establish safety rules that could be used by other countries.

• TAKEAWAY: The issue of regulation for the hydrogen industry was brought up by many of the speakers at last
week’s Japan Energy Summit. As the ammonia and hydrogen production, transport and utilization
technologies emerge, it will be up to Japanese regulators to make sure the regulations are taken that keep the
country’s progress on track.



Gas Association shares emergency plans
(Japan NRG, Aug. 5)
•  The Japan Gas Association (JGA) has delegated various emergency responsibilities to its members
if, for example, it’s confronted by a dramatic decrease in LNG imports.
•  City gas operators will share resources with each other and possibly with power grids. If supply is

cut drastically over a longer period and can’t be covered by resource-sharing, then the pipeline
network operators will collect data from LNG suppliers. Gas retailers will collect demand-side data
and inform customers.
•  The supply demand balance will be measured weekly and on the basis of regional gas networks
rather than each operator or municipal jurisdictions.
•  The JGA also suggested a gas version of the power demand-response scheme, which gives merit

points to industrial users that reduce consumption from year-ago levels.
•  CONTEXT: Gas sharing faces infrastructure issues. The networks aren’t interconnected. The
operators may not have enough LNG ships for local transport.

Used cooking oil export prices surge to be on par with palm oil in July
(Japan NRG, Aug. 3)
•  Prices of Japan’s exports of used cooking oil (UCO) were ¥184.8/ kg ex-plant in July, according to
the Japan Federation of Used Cooking Oil Businesses

•  The prices were at par with virgin palm oil trading at roughly ¥130-200/ kg CIF.
•  UCO export prices were ¥170.8/ kg in June and were ¥92.6/ kg a year ago.
•  CONTEXT: Palm oil is used for biomass power generation; UCO for biodiesel and aviation fuel.
Palm oil prices have eased recently as Indonesia cut the monthly oil reference price last month.
• TAKEAWAY: For a comprehensive look at how used cooking oil prices impact on the energy sector, see the
Analysis section in the May 23, 2022 Weekly.

Public submissions favor solar roof law in Tokyo
(Mainichi Shimbun, Aug. 5)
•  The Tokyo Metropolitan government released the survey results for its proposal to make solar
panels mandatory on new residential dwellings.
•  56% support the proposed bylaw, while 41% are opposed.

•  Young people were more likely to support the bylaw.


Shimizu Corp. builds low-cost green hydrogen demonstration plant
(Kankyo Business, Aug. 1)
•  Shimizu Corporation has set up a demonstration plant that uses low-cost green hydrogen

production technology in Kokonoe-cho, Oita Prefecture, and will begin operations this month.
•  The plant will utilize geothermal heat and biomass resources such as wood, and will conduct
demonstration tests with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions during production to less than
1/10th of commercial hydrogen and production costs to less than 1/3rd of water electrolysis
hydrogen that employs solar power.
•  MoE is supporting the project, which will operate continuously for approximately 25 days three

times between August and December.

Osaka Gas and Hyundai increase collaboration on hydrogen
(Nikkei, Aug. 3)
•  Osaka Gas subsidiary Daigas Gas and Power Solutions strengthened ties with Hyundai Rotem
Company (HRC) over the manufacture and sale of hydrogen, opening the door to sales of

hydrogen systems by HRC outside South Korea.


Euglena unveils production process of Susteo, algae-derived SAF

(Toyo Keizai, Aug 3)
•  Biofuel producer Euglena unveiled production processes of Susteo, biodiesel containing oil
derived from algae
•  The company grows algae called euglena and licenses biofuel production technologies from
Chevron Lummus Global and ARA to extract oil from the algae. Output is 5 barrels/day but
capacity will expand in 2025. Susteo is 10-20% algae oil and 80-90% used cooking oil.
•  Hiroshima-based automaker Mazda uses 100% algae fuel for competing in car races.



METI, Boeing expand cooperation ; Boeing to open sustainability research center in Nagoya
(Government and Company Statements, Aug. 1)
•  METI and Boeing agreed to expand their 2019 memorandum of cooperation on next-gen aircrafts
to explore sustainability solutions. METI will identify Japanese companies with relevant

technologies. Boeing will open a sustainability research center in Nagoya focused on sustainable
fuels, electric/hydrogen propulsion, robotics, digitization and carbon fiber composites.
•  Boeing will also join the ACT FOR SKY consortium to promote Japan-made SAF.
•  CONTEXT: Consumers hope that new market players will diversify and stabilize SAF supplies,
which hinge on availability of used cooking oil and vegetable oil resources. Euglena’s Susteo,
Japan’s best known SAF, comprises 10-20% of oil from algae called euglena, and 80-90% of used

cooking oil. Other SAF producers include IHI that uses algae; a group made of Mitsubishi Power,
JERA and Toyo uses wooden biomass. Quality storage of the oil, which degrades over time, as well
as the oil’s impact on the aircraft components after repeated use, are some of the safety issues to
clarify. Biofuel typically features higher viscosity than fossil fuel.


China and Japan trade blows over tritium release

(NHK, Aug. 3)
•  China criticized the Japanese government’s decision to discharge tritiated water stored on the site
of the Fukushima disaster into the sea, saying that the peaceful use of nuclear energy must not
come at the expense of health or the environment.
•  The Japanese government responded by saying that the concentrations of radioactive material in
the discharged water are well below the maximum allowed, and based on science.
•  The comments were made during a debate of the Non-Proliferation Treaty at the UN.

Siemens Gamesa got first order of offshore wind turbine in Japan
(Denki Shimbun, Aug. 1)
•  Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy won its first order for offshore wind turbines in Japan. At
Ishikari Bay New Port, Hokkaido, Siemens Gamesa will install 14 units for a 112 MW offshore wind
power project.
•  The developer is Green Power Investment (GPI); operation starts in late 2023.

•  CONTEXT: Siemens Gamesa’s predecessor company, Siemens, started the wind business in Japan
in 1999 and has since installed more than 1 GW of onshore wind turbines.
• TAKEAWAY: Only a few weeks ago, Japan’s top business newspaper, Nikkei, ran a story suggesting that
Siemens Gamesa and Vestas were ready to abandon plans to build local wind turbine assembly plants because
the Japanese market was not looking as promising as it once seemed. This was a reference to Mitsubishi Corp,
and its preferred wind turbine vendor GE, winning all the fixed-bottom offshore wind project tenders last year.

So, Siemens Gamesa securing its first order in Hokkaido is significant. The European manufacturer will hope
that this is an indication that Japan’s market really will accommodate a number of offshore turbine makers.



Unable to pass on higher fuel costs, power companies report quarterly loss
(Nikkei, Aug. 2)
•  Seven of Japan’s 10 major power companies reported losses for Q2.
•  The poor performance is because the utilities, which include Kansai Electric and TEPCO, maxed
out the ability to pass on higher fuel costs to users under a 1996 fuel surcharge scheme.
•  Some utilities, including Tohoku Electric, responded by increasing base tariffs or doing away with

caps on fuel surcharges.
•  It now costs an average of ¥101,000 to import a ton of LNG, double a year ago.



Kansai Electric delays restart of Mihama NPP Unit 3 citing a water leak

(Company Statement, Aug. 3)
•  The utility in western Japan said it will delay the restart of the Mihama NPP Unit. 3 reactor due to a
water leak discovered two days earlier. As the cause is still under investigation, the timeline of
restart is now undecided.
•  The leak was contained and no radiation exposure occurred.
•  CONTEXT: The reactor was slated to restart around Aug. 10-12. The utility said just a week earlier

that it brought forward the date from September to help ease a power crunch in the Kansai region.
• TAKEAWAY: The utility recently turned on two more reactors, which are now ramping up generation to full
volume. In total, it should have three reactors to manage the August demand peak. After Mihama No. 3 goes
back online, one more unit is due for a restart in December.

Rapid growth in support for reactor restart amongst Hamaoka residents
(Asahi Shimbun, Aug. 1)
•  A survey of residents in three municipalities near the Hamaoka NPP reveals a rapid increase in
support for the reactor’s restart.

•  In Kakegawa, 36% are against the reactor’s restart, while 33% are in favor.
•  Last year, 45% were opposed to the reactor’s restart, and only 29% were in favor.
•  Kakegawa Mayor Kubota Takashi attributed the change to a lobby campaign by Chubu Electric
and that a growing portion of the population is too young to remember Fukushima.




Hokkaido and Tokyo areas hit high price for baseload power, Kansai remains low
(Denki Shimbun, Aug. 5)
•  JPEX released the result of the 2022 baseload power market. While the price of Hokkaido and
Tokyo areas were ¥29.90/ kWh and ¥33.06/ kWh, almost 2.5 times higher than 2021, Kansai was

¥20/ kWh, which is only 38% higher than 2022.
•  As importantly, the trading volume of Hokkaido and Tokyo areas were very small, just 0.1 MW and
2.4 MW, respectively.
•  High gas and coal prices raise the high baseload power price. Kansai area secured over 700 MW of
trading volume, mainly due to the planned restart of Units 1 and 2 of the Takahama NPP.
•  The baseload market trade is held four times per year; the next one is on Sept. 30, 2023.



















Several major power utilities restart signing of new contracts for extra high voltage power
(Denki Shimbun, Aug. 2)
•  Hokkaido, Hokuriku, Kansai and Chugoku power utilities announced the restart of signing new
contracts for high voltage and extra high voltage customers. Power supply will be offered to such
customers from April 2023 based on regular price tables.

CONTEXT: After the power market was liberalized in April 2016, many customers changed power
suppliers to new entrants. However, due to a surge in fuel prices, and unseasonable hard weather,
some of the new players have gone bankrupt or exited the market. This led to a flood of

9


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

applications from industrial and commercial clients to return to the major power utilities, which the
latter could not process all at once. So, the utilities froze applications for a while.
• TAKEAWAY: Most new entrants to the Japan power retail market don’t have their own power source and rely
on the market for supply and resale. The recent market volatility makes this strategy untenable. A shakeout of
power retailers may continue if they can’t secure enough supply at stable costs.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO to raise price of power for industrial users from next April
(Denki Shimbun, Aug. 1)

o  TEPCO announced power price hikes for high voltage and extra-high voltage customers
from April 2023 as the utility seeks to cover losses stemming from rising fuel costs.
o  CONTEXT: This tends to be mostly industrial users.

Kansai Electric waste may stay in Fukui area after all
(Shukan Economist, Aug. 1)
•  Kansai Electric has yet to confirm where it will store its nuclear reactor waste.
•  With little time left until the December 2023 deadline for finding a storage site, it seems likely that

the waste will be stored in Fukui Prefecture, where its reactors are located.
•  Since the 1990s, the Fukui government has maintained that it will never allow waste generated by
its many nuclear reactors to be stored within the prefecture.
•  An earlier proposal to send the waste to an intermediary storage facility in Aomori was shelved
after it met with vehement opposition from the mayor of Mutsu.
•  According to local Fukui media, despite rumors that the waste will be taken to an island in the Seto

Inland Sea, a local councilor said that efforts to ship the waste out of the prefecture have failed.
•  There is speculation that the Fukui government will be forced to backtrack on its no-waste stance
and allow the waste to be stored locally, in exchange for compensation.

•  Japanese-Chinese joint venture QMB New Energy Materials in Indonesia started battery-grade
nickel-cobalt compound production after almost a three-year delay.
•  The plant has an annual capacity to process 30,000 tons of nickel and 2,400 tons of cobalt. A

second plant with capacity for 20,000 tons of nickel and 1,600 tons of cobalt will start later this
month.
•  Hanwa has an 8% stake in the project and the rest is owned by Chinese firms.
• TAKEAWAY: In 2022, Indonesia is expected to increase annual nickel production capacity by over 300,000
tons as new plants come online. Capacity expansion is seen to continue into 2023 on the back of battery
demand. It’s uncertain if supply increases will ease nickel prices back to 2018 levels of around $10,000/ ton,

down from current levels about $20,000/ ton. The project reached a formal agreement in 2018 and long-term
investment plans may be based on market prices at the time, meaning that at current nickel prices the project
may break earlier than forecasted.

New GX Council Prepares to Flex its Muscle
Soon after winning the Upper House election, Prime Minister Kishida began to forge
ahead with his policies. Energy is one of the top priorities, and Kishida is already
moving aggressively to implement significant changes that will cement Japan’s energy
transition strategy through the end of this decade.

Like the U.S. and the Eurozone, Japan hopes to chart a path to decarbonization
through large-scale, multi-year investments. On July 22, at a summer forum held by
the country’s biggest business group, the Keidanren, Kishida announced his plan for a
new ministerial post to “present a 10-year roadmap for decarbonization and increase
corporate predictability,” while reiterating that Japan’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal
“must be pursued”.

A new ministerial position for the green transformation (GX) was established, along
with a so-called GX Council to report directly to the PM’s Office. Kishida also pledged
that Japan “will prepare an unprecedented support framework that will catalyze long-
term massive investment by the private sector”.

Five days later, on July 27, the current Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry
(METI), Hagiuda Koichi, was tapped to simultaneously serve as the newly-created GX
Minister. Whether Hagiuda remains in charge when Kishida names a new Cabinet,
which is expected on Aug. 10, is unclear. Either way, the conflation of the METI and
GX roles is revealing about the way Kishida wishes to proceed.


Kishida put METI in charge of GX, but will current ministry Hagiuda lead both?

Setting policy priorities
The GX Council convened the same day that it was announced. It quickly divided
important policy tasks among ministries such as METI, the MoE and the Ministry of
Finance.
15

The Council consists of 13 members including the heads of Chubu Electric, the
Keidanren, and other business leaders. Among them is a top expert in Southeast
Asian studies, which reflects Kishida’s interest in promoting Japan’s net-zero agenda
in collaboration with the region. Kishida’s decarbonization strategy, for example,
includes plans for an "Asian Zero Emission Community" that involves Indonesia,
Vietnam, Thailand, and others.

The PM also stressed the importance of synchronizing a solution to the short-term
energy crisis and the promotion of medium- and long-term decarbonization activities.
Toward that goal, Kishida instructed the GX Council to clarify which items require
political decisions and which require institutional support.

The Council seeks to maximize the use of energy conservation, renewables, and
storage batteries to create a stable power and gas system, while also moving forward
with the restart of nuclear power plants.

The concept for Kishida’s GX emerged in May, when he hoped to convince the public
and private sectors to invest ¥150 trillion ($1.1 trillion), which is equivalent to 30% of
Japan’s GDP, in fields related to decarbonization over the next 10 years. Details and
the timetable for this is expected later this year.

The GX plan calls for developing next-gen power grids, improvements in chemical
and steel manufacturing processes, and the expansion of storage battery production.
Other areas will address everything from renewable energy and EVs, to energy-
efficient housing, CCUS, and R&D of next-gen nuclear reactors.


Financing
Given GX’s high investment targets, there’s an urgent need to create new financing
channels for decarbonization. But the inaugural meeting didn't discuss the institutional
design of potential GX bonds. Since the government intends to pass bills for the GX
strategy in next year's Diet session, discussion over fiscal resources must be done
before the end of 2022.

One proposal, made by the ruling LDP in the election campaign for the Upper House,
is to make an inaugural issue of ¥20 trillion ($148 billion) in “GX Economic Transition
Bonds”. In the future, carbon pricing and other fiscal methods may be used to yield
subsequent funds.

While more than a dozen countries have already issued green bonds, Japan has been
slow to act. The GX bonds would be more aligned with Japan’s decarbonization
strategy, in that proceeds would not be limited to renewable energy projects.
However, creating a new financial instrument is always tricky and requires time.

The bonds considered by the Ministry of Finance are called ‘bridging bonds,’ a
scheme similar to the ‘reconstruction bonds’ issued after the 2011 earthquake and
tsunami. Such ‘bridging bonds’ require financial resources to be secured in advance.

Other means of raising capital are needed, with carbon pricing considered. A
nationwide carbon credits exchange is in the process of launching. Other means

include a carbon tax and an existing surcharge on electricity bills that currently
supports the feed-in tariff (FIT) for renewable energy projects.

In other words, the burden will likely fall on businesses and households. Meanwhile,
some experts suggest ordinary taxes should be levied as a more straightforward
option. There is concern that the investment targets are overly ambiguous. Unlike the
green bonds issued by Germany and other countries, the criteria for GX-like transition
bonds are loose.

By deliberately choosing to create the new GX category instead of selling green
bonds that are common overseas, Japan may find its investor pool limited. Some
funds have a mandate limited to green investments and may question the inclusion of
coal and ammonia co-firing projects in the decarbonization agenda.

The conservative business daily, Yomiuri, Japan’s biggest newspaper, also warned
against issuing GX bonds “simply to support companies” and thereby launching a
spending craze. An even more divisive issue for international investors may be the use
of GX bond proceeds to finance nuclear power.

It’s unclear whether financing from the government’s bonds will extend to nuclear, but
media reports suggest that Kishida is considering the construction of new nuclear
plants. While the PM supports restarting Japan’s existing reactors in the face of high
electricity prices, the topic of new nuclear construction is incredibly sensitive. Yet even
as Kishida weighs up how much he will direct his GX strategy towards new nuclear
facilities, the Keidanren is already calling on national investments in nuclear fusion.

Later this week, Kishida is expected to reshuffle his Cabinet, clarifying who will lead
the GX initiative as METI and GX minister. The incumbent, Hagiuda, has high standing
within the ruling LDP and was one of the closest allies of recently murdered PM Abe.
However, certain media speculation around Hagiuda may push Kishida to make a
change.

More importantly, Kishida is also expected to unveil a new Clean Energy Strategy
before the end of 2022, which should flesh out the various GX initiatives that have
filtered into the public arena so far and place them in a coherent narrative.

The time to back up the political hype around GX with a detailed plan has come.
Kishida now has a chance to set Japan’s energy course in practical terms for the rest
of the decade.

Why You Need an Exit Strategy When Joining a New Company

The title of this article must certainly sound odd. If you’re about to accept an offer to
start work at a company then shouldn’t you be committed to that decision and not
thinking about how to leave? Well, that’s not entirely true. In fact, it’s a good idea to
think about an exit strategy from the very start.

Here’s how an exit strategy can help you make clearer, more informed decisions and
deal with challenges in your new position.

The energy market today is very different than 10 years ago when it was dominated
by giant power utilities, Fortune 500 manufacturers, and behemoth trading houses.
Today we see a very different corporate landscape. Small retailers with innovative
solutions are gaining share in a deregulated marketplace, multinational developers
are building major renewable assets as the energy transition accelerates, and venture
capital startups are making faster inroads in battery technology than yesterday’s
dinosaurs.

The reality of this diversified, rapidly changing marketplace is that not every player is
going to be a leader; nor will they survive three years from now, not to mention in five
years. There’s a higher risk today than ever before that a company will fail, go
bankrupt, become uncompetitive, or pull out of the market. Does this sound
depressing? We hope not. We think it’s exciting.

Today, more than ever, energy industry professionals have the chance to create value
for themselves as professionals. By taking control of your career, you have the ability
to expose yourself to and embrace new ideas, technologies, and methodologies, and
therefore increase your knowledge, skills and overall market value as a professional.

Let’s look at a job change within the same industry (i.e., moving from a power utility
doing offshore wind to a global wind project developer); or, from a traditional battery
manufacturer to a startup that develops new battery tech:

•  Does the company operate differently from your current organization?
•  Does the team include people from diverse backgrounds?
•  Does each have an area of particular expertise (say, engineering talent, data
from global projects, patents and intellectual property, advanced investment
know-how to structure complex deals, etc.)?
•  Are there few strata between yourself and high-level decision makers?
•  Will they pay you more than your current salary?

If you’re answering ‘Yes’ to three or more of these questions, chances are you’ll learn
more in that new job than if you stay in your current/old job. If it’s a ‘No’, then that
job probably is not a good opportunity!

Exit strategy
Regardless of the company, there’s a chance that in the future an exit event will occur
that makes you want to or need to leave:

§  At a utility, you might be pushed into a role outside your interest;
§  At a global developer, if they’re unsuccessful they may leave Japan;
§  At a battery start-up, their technology could fail;
§  At a traditional battery maker, their technology could become obsolete.

When this exit event occurs, any new opportunity will depend on how much value
you’ve recently created in yourself. So, do everything possible to learn from more
qualified people, be exposed to new technologies, and be eager to embrace new
procedures and methodologies. All this helps to increase your benchmark salary and
value as a professional.

In general, the confidence you gain by having a “ready” exit strategy shouldn’t be
underestimated. Any new role you take will have challenges. There’s no such thing
anymore as an easy and safe job. Having an exit strategy gives you the confidence to
know that tackling these challenges opens up more doors in the future, regardless of
whether you and the company succeed. This puts responsibility for your future in your
hands, as opposed to relying on your company will take care of you until retirement.

Examples in the market today
Every company except Mitsubishi Corp. lost the Round 1 offshore wind auctions last
December. But this is not a loss for the people who rivaled Mitsubishi in the bidding.
In fact, those involved in the losing bids are now in high demand across the industry!

Over the last month, Titan introduced clients to three professionals who had
experience in developing Round 1 projects. As some light was shed on changes for
Round 2, these professionals lost confidence in their organization’s chance of success
and decided to look for a stronger player.

On behalf of these three, all of our introductions resulted in job interviews, with 50%
of those resulting in employment offers. Two out of 3 received multiple offers,
allowing them to select the firm that they thought was the best match for their
personal situation.

Another area where we see this phenomenon is in power trading. Again, this is a
developing and growing area in Japan, which has led to a situation of high demand,
low supply of qualified professionals. This opens up opportunities for those in
adjacent fields, such as commodity trading at a gas utility or a trading house. Take on
the challenge today, learn quickly, and you could become one of the few people in
the market with this unique experience that’s also in high demand. This will help
secure your career, not just your job.

As an agency, the most common question we get about people who’ve spent 15 to
20 or more years in one organization remains: ‘Is this person capable of learning new
things and methods?’.

Simply experiencing change is in itself a measure of growth and therefore creates
personal value.

Beware, however. Job hopping too much (defined by joining and leaving before
achieving anything noteworthy) will most likely decrease your value as a professional.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Azerbaijan/ Solar power
A number of banks led by the EBRD approved a $114 million investment for a 230
MW solar project developed by Masdar Azerbaijan Energy, which is fully owned by
Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company. Masdar’s Garadagh Plant is Azerbaijan’s first
privately owned, utility-scale solar project.

China/ Power grid
The State Grid will invest about $22 billion in the second half of 2022 in ultra high
voltage (UHV) power transmission lines. Construction of eight new UHV projects will
connect China's far western regions — where solar, wind and hydropower plants are
mainly located — to the major cities.

Energy/ Record profits
Glencore’s profits more than doubled to a record in 1H/2022. A strong performance
in its coal business accounted for nearly half of its record $18.9 billion in earnings,
beating its 2021 half-year record and the $18.4 billion expected by analysts.

EU/ Russia/ Diesel fuel
Monthly imports of Russian diesel increased more than 20% in July, reaching almost
700,000 barrels a day, which is a 22% increase YoY, according to Vortexa, a tanker
tracking group. This reveals the EU’s difficulty in entirely forgoing Russian energy
supplies.

Germany/ Solar and wind power
Solar systems with a total capacity of 574 MW went online in June, bringing the
country’s new solar in the first half of 2022 to 3.2 GW. New onshore wind power,
however, slowed in June as wind turbines with a total capacity of 200 MW joined the
grid. In the first six months of 2022, new onshore wind in Germany reached 1 GW.

India/ Strategic minerals
Ten years from now, India could eclipse China as the world’s leading buyer of
strategic minerals, according to Dambisa Moyo, the global investor and economist,
citing China’s debt and demographic challenges, which will become “incredibly
problematic”. India’s population will surpass China’s this year.

OPEC/ Oil output
Together with allies, OPEC agreed to its smallest oil production increase ever, of just
100,000 barrels a day, or 0.1% of global demand. Experts see this as a snub to
presidents Biden and Macron after the two met Saudi Arabia’s crown prince
Mohammed bin Salman separately in recent weeks.

Philippines/ Battery storage
Ingrid Power Holdings, a JV of ACEN Corp. and Axia Power Holdings Philippines
Corp., will build a 270 MW battery energy storage system. It will charge from the grid
when there’s excess energy and electricity marginal prices are low. Then, the stored
energy will be sold to the grid during high-power demand and electricity prices.

Russia/ Energy investments
President Putin issued a decree banning investors from ‘unfriendly countries’ – those
that support sanctions on Russia – from selling shares in energy projects and banks.
The decree takes effect immediately and concerns selling assets in production sharing
agreements, strategic entities, energy equipment manufacture, as well as other
projects.

Solar power
Solar capacity will grow 30% globally this year, with double-digit growth expected in
2023 to 2025. "We are on track to install 250 GW of solar capacity this year; more
than the installed capacity of a number of EU countries,” said Rob Barnett, a
Bloomberg clean energy analyst. China leads the world in solar and plans to double
its total solar panels this year.

UK/ Energy prices
Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight warned that households will continue to struggle
with soaring electricity and gas bills, and it forecasts that Britain’s yearly energy price
cap will remain above £3,000 on average until “at least 2024”.
