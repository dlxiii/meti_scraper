NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Kishida calls for ‘GX2.0’: a 2040 energy strategy with roadmap for decarbonization

(Government statement, May 13)
•  PM Kishida called for a new 2040 energy and climate strategy called ‘GX 2.0’. METI and GX
Minister Saito will form the “GX 2040 Leaders Panel” to write it.
•  Kishida explained that the first iteration of GX, or ‘GX 1.0’ was about setting regulatory, fiscal, tax,
market and international certification frameworks for carbon pricing, as well as outlining a ¥150
trillion GX investment program to expand low-carbon power sources, etc.
•  The next iteration, GX 2.0, will clarify realistic roadmaps to 2040 to cope with the challenges

around meeting the nation’s final 2050 carbon neutrality goal.
•  Issues to address include the expansion of AI data centers that are now seen as a matter of
national security. There are unprecedented new requirements to provide high quality
decarbonized power supplies in distributed locations in a short timeframe.
•  Kishida also called for a review of how Japan can accelerate efforts to reduce its reliance on fossil
fuels – especially due to an expected increase in the volatility of oil and gas prices, in part caused
by “the situation in the Middle East and other factors.”

•  Kishida mentioned an acceleration of divestments from new upstream oil and coal projects as
another factor impacting prices and supply.
•  Thus, Japan needs to look into carbon pricing, long-term decarbonized power source investments
and securing strategic backup power sources, he said.
•  The GX 2.0 strategy should accommodate changes in industrial structures and their locations,
technology breakthroughs, and consumer behavior, coming up with realistic paths to

decarbonization that can be shared by the public and private sectors.
•  CONTEXT: Under the Paris Agreement, governments are required to submit an updated nationally
determined contribution (NDC) plan to the UN by 2025. Japan’s present commitment is a 46% cut
in emissions by 2030 over 2013’s levels. The next NDC needs to be more ambitious.
• TAKEAWAY: The sudden emergence of a GX 2.0, with arguably the first iteration of the plan yet to fully take
root, shows PM Kishida feels a sense of urgency. The reasons may be several, from the need to demonstrate
positive action domestically amid weak polling numbers and to the international community ahead of the G7

meeting and the latest COP climate summit. However, the biggest driver is likely to be the realization in
government that the country’s digital strategy will generate new and substantial new energy demand that may
not have been considered within the current GX program. We will cover this issue in more detail in upcoming
reports.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Basic Energy Plan discussions begin
(Government statement, May 15)
o  On May 15, the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy officially launched
discussions on the 7th Basic Energy Plan, a national energy strategy. The Committee will
align with another panel writing the GX 2.0 2040 strategy.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  The 2040 strategy will show directions for energy supply security, decarbonization and
investments; Basic Energy Plan discussions will focus on energy mix details and strategies
for each energy and power source.
o  Key discussion points include the potential to expand renewable energy sources further,
the share of nuclear in the national power mix, and possible increases in green power

demand from data centers.
o  The panel will compile a proposal by year’s end.



METI sets clean energy shift strategy for speedy tech development

(Government statement, May 14)
•  METI set its “2024 Strategy for Technologies to Drive Energy Savings and Shift to Non-fossil
Energy”, identifying 28 base technologies that need rapid development.
•  NEDO will provide financial support for their development. The technologies are applicable to
hard-to-abate sectors as well as for transport and homes.
•  Examples are ferro-coke development in steelmaking, hydrogen-fueled transport, heat pumps and
energy management at industrial plants, as well as zero-emission buildings and houses.
•  CONTEXT: METI annually picks key climate technologies and their development roadmaps. Some

of these technologies have been on the GX agenda for a while.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI minister meets Saudi Arabian officials ahead of prince’s visit
(Government statement, May 16)
o  METI Minister held an online meeting with Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Investment and a

separate meeting with the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Japan ahead of the May 20
Crown Prince Salman’s visit to Tokyo.



METI launches new panel on legal issues for emissions trading

(Government statement, May 17)
•  METI launched a 10-member panel to clarify legal issues for emissions trading systems. Tokyo
University professor Takamura Yukari chairs the group.
•  The panel will study how the EU emissions scheme performs if the Japanese systems were applied,
and identify legal issues.
•  The panel won’t design the emissions trading scheme; another panel will be set up to build on the
legal issue discussions. It will publish recommendations in September.




Parliament approves CCS, low-carbon hydrogen acts
(Parliament statement, May 17)
•  On May 17, the Diet passed bills on carbon storage and support measures to promote low-carbon

hydrogen.

5



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The Act on Carbon Dioxide Storage defines licensing, exploration and other processes for CCS
operations. The Mining Act, Radioactive Substance Disposal Act, Marine Pollution Act, Bankruptcy
Act, etc, were also amended to synchronize with the Carbon Dioxide Storage Act.
•  The Act on Promoting Supply and Use of Low-Carbon Hydrogen for a Smooth Shift to Low Carbon
Growth Oriented Economic Structure will allow METI to provide subsidies and regulatory support

to parties in the low-carbon hydrogen supply chains.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JR Central, Hitachi, ENEOS ink hydrogen agreement
(Company statement, May 16)
o  Central Japan Railway Company, Hitachi and ENEOS inked a basic agreement to
develop supply networks to fuel hydrogen train systems.
o  They chose methylcyclohexane (MCH) compounds as the medium to carry hydrogen at

room temperatures.
o  They will explore transport, storage, fueling of trains, transport of hydrogen on trains and
consuming the gas on board.
o  CONTEXT: The key technology for the supply chain is retrieving hydrogen from MCH
that’s not as straightforward as converting hydrogen into MCH, and making compact
equipment to perform the chemical reactions, whether to perform them on or off the

trains.



Japan seeks to accelerate nuclear fusion, but challenges remain

(Nikkei Asia, May 10)
•  Japan plans to accelerate nuclear fusion technology development, to catch up with the U.S.,
China, and the U.K., all of which have plans to test fusion power by the 2040s.
•  Japan will bring forward new legislative and testing timelines in its June economic and fiscal
policy.
•  CONTEXT: Fusion technology is more costly than renewable energy and traditional nuclear power.
It requires advanced materials and large equipment.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

The Cabinet discusses safety measures for fusion power
(Nikkei, May 10)
o  The Cabinet Office began discussions on safety measures and regulations for fusion
power, with an eye to its industrialization.
o  The Cabinet has a fusion panel of 13 specialists.

•  CONTEXT: Australia has geographical sites suitable for CO2 storage, and is working on regulations
to develop CCS businesses and receive CO2 from abroad.
• TAKEAWAY: While Australia has been fostering international cooperation on CCS, limited funding and a lack
of infrastructure impede plans for a Japan-Australian CCS value chain.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
EC grants PCI status to MOL’s CC and transport project in Baltic region
(Company statement, May 16)
o  The European Commission granted PCI status to a CO2 capture and transportation

project called the CCS Baltic Consortium — it includes Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL),
SCHWENK Latvija SIA, etc.
o  The goal is to create a CCS value chain in the region. The PCI status will facilitate the
project’s start, with operations to begin in 2030.

Sumitomo Electric starts building £350 mln factory in Scotland to make subsea cables

(Japan NRG, May 15)
•  Sumitomo Energy began construction of a subsea transmission cables factory at the Port of Nigg in
Scotland.
•  The £350 million factory should be operational in 2026, and will be Sumitomo’s first cable factory
in Europe and the first HVDC cable factory in the UK.
•  It will manufacture cables to connect and deliver electricity from renewables facilities, including
offshore wind.

•  CONTEXT: The UK ranks second in the world in terms of nameplate capacity for offshore wind
power (22% share of the global total). Therefore it’s a lucrative market for companies like
Sumitomo Energy.



JERA announces 2035 strategy for decarbonization and energy transition

(Company statement, May 16)
•  JERA announced its 2035 growth strategy for decarbonization and the energy transition, with three
key areas: LNG, renewables, and hydrogen & ammonia.
•  As for LNG, it aims to have transactions in the fuel for over 35 million tons by 2035. In the
renewables sector, the goal is 20 GW of capacity by the same year. Finally, for hydrogen and
ammonia, it targets 7 million tons of volume.

•  By 2035, JERA aims for a net profit of ¥350 billion and an EBITDA of ¥700 billion. Plans call for
investing ¥5 trillion in LNG, renewables, and hydrogen & ammonia.
•  JERA plans to reduce CO2 emissions 20% by 2030, total CO2 emissions 60% by FY2035, and
achieve zero emissions by 2050. It plans to phase out coal-fired power by FY2030. It will convert
remaining coal-fired power to ammonia by the 2040s.
• TAKEAWAY: JERA is Japan’s biggest power company and top trader of LNG. Its strategy will likely be followed

by other major power utilities and suggests that in the domestic market the major players may seek to balance
LNG as a baseload power source with a stronger renewables business, while looking for ways to transition the
coal fleet to ammonia or hydrogen.




JERA postpones Chita expansion after winning decarbonized power supply auction
(Denki Shimbun, May 17)
•  JERA President Hisae Okuda said the company will postpone a decision on the construction of
new Units 7 and 8 at the Chita Thermal Power Plant (Aichi Pref) that won in the long-term

decarbonized power supply auction.
•  A company that withdraws from a winning bid faces a financial penalty.
9



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  JERA President Okuda noted that under the auction rules, 90% of fixed costs are returned but
variable costs are not compensated. For an LNG-fired plant, there are uncertainties around future
fuel costs, power demand, and whether the facility will be used as a baseload power source, or
not, Okuda said.
•  JERA will discuss the issue with the government, Okuda said.
•  Units 1, 2, 3, and 4 at the Chita power plant were shut in 2017. Only Units 5 and 6 are now

operational (total capacity 1.7 GW); both run as combined cycle plants that are fueled by LNG.
•  CONTEXT: At the end of April, Japan had its first ever long-term decarbonized power auction. A
total of 42 decarbonized power projects were chosen, the majority were for battery projects and
energy storage, but the biggest winners in terms of total capacity were gas-fired power plants.
• TAKEAWAY: As reviewed in the Analysis section of this week’s report, there are a number of uncertainties
stemming from the new auction. While there may be financial penalties for not delivering the capacity, these

are thought to be relatively small and not an obstacle for developers to renege on their construction plans
should the economics of their project change. However, if a number of winning bids fail to deliver the
promised capacity, auction rules will most likely be tightened going forward.




Spot market sees supply-demand fluctuations in March, supply down 15%
(Japan NRG and Denki Shimbun, May 14)
•  March data from JEPX show the daily average Sell bids (i.e. supply volume) was at 1.03 TWh, down
15.3% from the previous month. Buy bids (i.e. demand volume) and 889.5 GWh, down 0.4%.

•  The period between March 27-29 March saw several of JERA's thermal power plants shut due to
fuel constraints, but the impact on prices was limited. Instead, the market saw waves of fluctuation
in supply and demand.
•  For comparison, April data show Sell volumes rose slightly to 1.09 TWh; but Buy volumes declined
to 789.7 GWh.
•  The total monthly volumes for March were: Sell bids down 9.5% YoY to 32.13 TWh; Buy bids up

6.4% YoY to 27.57 TWh.
•  Average supply volume per product was 21.6 GWh, down 15.3% YoY. Of this, daytime supply was
down 12.2%; peak hours was down 10.3%; and evening supply was down 20.6%. Demand volumes
were little changed, apart from peak times (down 2.7%).




Volume sold by new market players up in Dec; significant rise in low-voltage category
(Denki Shimbun, May 13)
•  ANRE reported that the number of new players in the electricity market (known as shin-denryoku)
rose to 694 as of December 2023.
•  Of that total, 513 actually had sales, three fewer than a year ago. Tokyo Gas took the top spot for
the 9th consecutive month in terms of total electricity sales.
•  CONTEXT: While a large number of companies have a retail license, some have either never used

it or are not currently using it. Even of those that posted sales results, only about a fifth are
understood to be retailing electricity outside of their group entities.

10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Overall power volume sold by new market entrants rose 16.4% YoY to 11.02 TWh, mainly due to
increased heating demand in winter. Low-voltage sales increased 24.5% YoY, high-voltage sales
increased 10.6% YoY, and extra high-voltage sales decreased 0.5% YoY.
•  In the low-voltage category, Daiwa House reached the 10th spot after posting a 34.6% YoY jump in
sales. Many new market players booked bigger sales in the high-voltage category.

• TAKEAWAY: After several years of aggressively taking market share from EPCOs (the major power utilities),
new entrants saw their positions eroded in the past two years due to price spikes and higher volatility. More
stability in the market recently is helping non-EPCO players to revive their business, but the upcoming summer
peak demand period will be another test for the retailer business model.



Chubu Electric acquires stake in Dutch offshore wind firm Ecowende

(Company statement, May 9)
•  Chubu Electric completed its investment in Hollandse Kust West Site VI, an offshore wind power

TEPCO plans to restart Unit 7 of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP by Oct

(Bloomberg, May 13)
•  In October, TEPCO hopes to restart Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP Unit 7.
•  This will be the first time post-Fukushima that TEPCO operates a nuclear reactor in compliance
with the new stringent safety regulations.
•  According to consultancy BNEF, average electricity prices in Japan will decrease 11% in 2024, due
to sluggish demand and increased supply from nuclear and renewables, which will deepen duck

curves and intraday volatility. BNEF sees power prices averaging ¥11-12/ kWh in the coming two
years.
•  CONTEXT: Before the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, the 1,000 acre Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP was
the largest nuclear generating station in the world by nameplate capacity, at about 8 GW.

• TAKEAWAY: Japan aims to bring five more reactors online by 2025. This alone will not be enough for nuclear
generation to account for 20% of the power mix by 2030, as per the govt’s plan. Japan will have to accelerate
the restart of operable nuclear capacity in the second half of the decade to hit its power targets and also to
meet interim emission reduction goals.

•  Residents are concerned about population decline and reputational damage. The population has
decreased 16% over ten years, and the mayor seeks local revitalization.
•  CONTEXT: Over the past year Japan has accelerated efforts to restart nuclear reactors to boost
carbon-free energy production. Restarting NPPs of course requires solutions in place to dispose of

nuclear waste. Genkai is the third municipality to accept a survey for a waste disposal site; the
others are Muttsu and Kamoenai (Hokkaido).
• TAKEAWAY: The Genkai decision is unlikely to lead to its selection as host of a final nuclear waste disposal
facility. The entire process requires a decade of surveys; and what's more, previous studies showed that
Genkai is unlikely to be geologically suitable for such a site.

Idemitsu follows plan envisioned by Murakami fund to buy 20% of Fuji Oil
(Sentaku, May-2024 issue)
•  Idemitsu Kosan, Japan's second-biggest oil refiner, will increase its Fuji Oil Co. stake to 20% and

make it an equity method company. Idemitsu and Fuji are considering collaborations that include
jointly procuring raw materials.
•  The reorganization resembles one proposed in 2021 by an activist fund related to Murakami
Yoshiaki, which at the time was Fuji Oil’s biggest shareholder. The fund pressured Fuji Oil to
become part of Idemitsu, said an industry source, but the firm wanted to stay independent.
•  Back then, Idemitsu felt there was a reputational risk due to the association with Murakami,

according to a source in the company. But ultimately, Idemitsu took the path of increasing its stake
in Fuji Oil by acquiring stock from JERA and Sumitomo Chemical.
•  CONTEXT: The domestic fuels market has been in fundamental decline for over a decade due to
the shrinking of the population and a switch to cleaner alternatives. For Idemitsu, industry
consolidation avenues, however, are slim. Fuji Oil has supplied petroleum products to facilities
now owned by Idemitsu since at least 2005.

•  Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries in South Korea will build and deliver the vessels in 2026. They
can run on LPG or conventional heavy oil, as well as transport ammonia.



LNG stocks increased to 2.14 mln tons, 11% down YoY

(Government data, May 15)
•  As of May 12, the LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 2.14 million tons, up 6.5% from May 5
(2.01 million tons). This is 11.2% down YoY (2.41 million tons), and 1.4% more than the past five-
year average of 2.11 million tons.
•  For the past several weeks, LNG stock levels have hovered around the five-year average but
slightly less than the 2023 level.

•  The JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) said that the rainy season will begin in the first week of
June. Thus, electric companies will start to prepare for increasing power demand from cooling
devices.

Japan’s First Long-Term Decarbonized Power Auction is a Boost

for BESS, Foreign Investors
Grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) were the biggest winners in Japan’s
first ever long-term decarbonized power auction, which was held in January, showing
that investments in the innovative green technology are well worth the risk.

That first auction, which was conducted under the auspices of the Organization for
Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO), proved to be most
profitable for BESS and pumped hydro storage developers. The government had
allocated over 1.6 GW of capacity for 30 such projects.

Nevertheless, even though the government introduced the scheme to promote and
finance a shift away from fossil fuels, it supported the co-firing of ammonia or
hydrogen with coal. Also, the auction had a separate category for gas-fired capacity
from LNG. Such an approach initially raised concerns that METI would use the scheme
to prop up thermal generation.


Contrary to speculation, however, the auction results announced on April 26 showed
that officials are not trying to slow the transition to renewables. In fact, the low-
commitment auction criteria left both the government and developers with room for
second thoughts.

So, how can we be sure that all of the winning projects will come online? How will the
results affect the next auction? Japan NRG looks at the results of Japan’s first long-
term decarbonized power auction (LTDA) and examines the rewards and challenges
that developers may face.

LTDA as optimal platform for BESS expansion
A total of 42 decarbonized power projects were chosen in the first LTDA – 30 were
BESS, two biomass, and one nuclear; in addition, three were for pumped hydro
storage and five for thermal turbines modified to co-fire coal with ammonia, and one
to co-fire with hydrogen.

The contracts guarantee 20 years of revenue covering fixed costs as long as
developers or BESS operators make the capacity available over a long-term period, 20
years in principle. This offers a safety net for a whole wave of BESS projects as the
government supports the build out of a battery storage sector from a very low base.

The wide range of companies from abroad that applied for BESS contracts indicates
that developers are aware of Japan’s high and rising level of renewable energy
curtailment.

Battery storage systems offer flexibility with peak shaving, self-consumption
optimization, and backup power in the event of outages. They are crucial to ensure
stable power supply when there is a high proportion of variable renewables like wind
and solar.

17



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

METI-affiliated OCCTO assigned 1.09 GW of BESS capacity across 30 projects. The
winning bids accounted for only 24% of all projects in the category.

Renova, which brands itself as Japan’s only listed pure-play renewables developer,
and with assets in other parts of Asia, won three contracts for projects totalling 215
MW.

The single biggest BESS contract award was for 96.2 MW to a business run by
financial services company Orix for its Maibara City Koto Energy Storage.
























Nozomi Energy, a renewables developer founded by global investment group Actis,
won bids for two BESS projects that each offer an initial installed capacity of close to
200 MWh.


Among the successful bids, however, were mostly small-scale projects, which could be
interpreted as the authorities’ cautious approach towards the new technology, or a
desire from developers to start small in a burgeoning field. With weak penalties for
non-delivery, there are also questions over whether all the contracted BESS projects
will come online.

LTDA winners could use their contracts to secure financing, but review the business
model if better review streams become available. In this, the LTDA may act almost as
a hedging tool for developers. But a high cancellation rate would almost certainly
push METI to alter future auction criteria.

New platform for non-Japanese investors and businesses
Winners have since said that key to securing contracts were the competitive rates of
their proposed capacity payments. Those with experience in other national markets
seemed to have the edge, with international developers snagging at least 20 LTDA
project contracts.

This openness to overseas players in the first auction of its kind came as a contrast to
the way the offshore wind tenders have played out. In Round 1, all winners were
domestic companies. In Round 2, German utility RWE and Spain’s Iberdrola were,
separately, members of some of the winning consortiums.

The list of winners in the LTDA includes Canadian Solar that secured as much as
13.3% of the total capacity for its three BESS projects. The firm’s projects, promising
193 MW of capacity, are located in Aomori, Fukushima, and Yamaguchi prefectures.
They will feature the SolBank 3.0 system launched by the company’s subsidiary e-
STORAGE, and are expected to begin commercial operation between 2027 and 2028.

Winners also included:
•  Singapore-based CHC Energy (with input from U.S. asset manager
Stonepeak);
•  A JV between Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology
(CATL) and Cathay Fortune Company, as well as New York-based Hartree
Partners;
•  Canadian Solar-backed Teeda Power;
•  Hexa Energy Services, supported by I Squared Capital.


Hexa Renewables bagged the highest number of projects with 11. Singapore-based
Equis, which develops renewables and waste infrastructure, was the only winner in the
biomass category, picking up contracts for two projects in Hokkaido. Both are 112
MW – one in Ishikari, and another near Tomakomai City. Equis already has several
operational biomass plants in Japan, one of which is run jointly with Tohoku Electric.

Nuclear and hydro
The LTDA proved most popular among BESS developers, as 4.56 GW of proposed
capacity was offered, exceeding the limit allocated for the entire renewables section
(4 GW). But other energy sources also did well during the auction.

OCCTO awarded 1.3 GW to nuclear power capacity, opening up the possibility that
major utilities will utilize this scheme to help finance ongoing NPP construction. There
are three reactors in Japan officially listed as “mid-construction”. The long lead time
for new nuclear plants would make it difficult to utilize LTDA in its current form.

The auction’s entire nuclear allocation went to Chugoku Electric, which is building Unit
3 at its Shimane NPP. The 1.37 GW advanced BWR reactor is obligated by LTDA rules
to make its capacity available from FY2027. However, four days after the LTDA
announcement, Chugoku Electric said that it aims to complete the reactor only in
FY2028, with operations likely to begin in FY2030.

Unit 3 at Shimane began construction in 2006, but work was frozen after the
Fukushima disaster. Any start of operation is dependent on winning approval from the

19

nuclear regulator and a green light from the local community. Both have proved tricky
challenges for NPP restarts in the past decade.



















Chugoku Electric’s Shimane nuclear power plant

Meanwhile, OCCTO also awarded contracts for 577 MW of pumped hydro storage.
Kansai Electric (KEPCO) was among the recipients, securing contracts for two large
pumped storage projects at its Okutataragi hydro station in Asago, Hyogo Prefecture.
The winning contracts will apply to Units 3 and 4, (each 254 MW output), but these
aren’t for new facilities. Launched in 1975 and with a maximum total output of 1.9
GW, Okutataragi is Japan’s largest pumped-storage hydropower station.

To reduce fossil fuel costs and improve generation efficiency in partial load, KEPCO
decided to enlarge the station’s LFC (Load Frequency Control) capacity through
renovation of an
existing pumped-
storage power
station from fixed
speed to adjustable
speed. The funding
in the FY2023 LTDA
will enable KEPCO
to complete the
renovation work on
two units.

LNG – the quiet
winner
The biggest
allocation in terms
of capacity, however, went to ten LNG-firing plants with capacities ranging from 463
MW to 615 MW (5.75 GW in total). Operators of those are: Hokkaido Electric, Tohoku


20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Electric, KEPCO (3 projects), Chugoku Electric, Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and JERA (2
projects).

LNG projects are eligible to take part in the LTDA for another two years. But there is a
cap of 6 GW of LNG capacity over a three-year period. Since most of the cap was
already used in the first auction, it will be interesting to see whether officials extend
the allocation for LNG capacity next year. METI has explained this inclusion as driven
by the need to create replacement baseload capacity and phase out older thermal
stations.

How will the auction pan out in the next few years?
With the phaseout of LNG from FY2026, the auction will open up significant capacity
for other energy sources. Some see this as an opening for larger BESS projects to
capture funding. This year’s results also indicate that projects may not need to start
exactly four years from the auction to qualify, and that renovations of existing capacity
will compete alongside new ones.

Market players also expect a gradual tightening of auction rules to mandate the
completion of winning projects, as per the conditions for similar tenders overseas.
This time, OCCTO asked bidders to register for the auction several months before the
bids were even due. This kind of long-term commitment to the LTDA will make more
sense for developers that want to see the project to completion, which would cover
the time and resources invested.

While most expect the BESS capacity allocation to grow, some agree with the
government’s gradual opening up of the sector, warning that awarding too many
contracts at once would lead to over-build in certain areas and affect either grid
connections or project economics.

There are also few battery facilities now in operation in Japan, which means data on
long-term battery performance, degradation, and synchronization with generation
assets is thin. With the phase out of LNG from the LTDA, and limited scope for new
and even updated pumped storage capacity in Japan, the biggest rivals to BESS in
future auctions may come from nuclear and co-firing facilities.

ANALYSIS

Understanding the Complexities and Nuances of Japan’s Power Markets

From the 1950s until the mid-1990s, Japan’s electric power sector was dominated by
10 regional companies that were responsible for all power generation, distribution
and sales. Since then, the nation’s power industry has undergone a variety of
significant reforms that seek to foster competition among companies selling electricity
to end-users.

In this article, Japan NRG reviews the current state of electricity markets that now
involve 1,133 generation firms, 729 retailers and 55 transmission operators. We look
at the main market structure in place today and how they are changing.

Background
Japan’s electricity industry and market reforms started in the early part of this century,
but a full retail market liberalization had to wait until 2016. The goal was to create a
more vibrant market that would naturally lower prices.

The reforms sought to ensure competitive neutrality on the basis of stable supply. But
with the original 10 power utilities, known as EPCOs, still dominant and the
government keen to protect households and big industrial energy users from price
volatility, the power market has evolved into a hybrid structure that combines market
trading and tariffs.


The government has also introduced more trading and auction platforms to mirror the
fragmentation of the electricity industry across regions, generation sources, business
models and consumer demands. And yet, disparities remain.

The latest policy discussions within METI and its expert panels reflect a growing sense
of the need to reverse market fragmentation. Recent proposals talk of the need to
eliminate state tariffs altogether, while integrating various market platforms to bind
spot and futures trading. Market purists want physical, derivative, and standby/
backup trading to be all connected so that it better reflects the realities of operating
power facilities.

Speaking to officials, it seems that all options are on the table, as long as they lead to
stable prices and resilient power companies and systems. The following are the main
power trading platforms in Japan.

Wholesale electricity market
JEPX (Japan Electric Power Exchange) acts as an intermediary for electricity sales
between producers and retailers, facilitating transactions linked to physical delivery. It
is a private exchange managed by a general incorporated association of electric
power companies and other such entities.

Established in 2003 and launched in 2005 as a market for the commodity trading of
electric power, JEPX serves as an intermediary for electricity spot trading, forward


22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

transactions, non-fossil value transactions, indirect power transmission right
transactions and base load transactions.

It serves as a platform for three types of markets :
•  Spot day-ahead, which is the main market where electricity is traded for
delivery on the following day;
•  Intraday market, or same-day market, for electricity supplied on a day when
the spot market is closed; it enables members to trade electricity until one
hour prior to actual use; and
•  Forward fixed-form market to trade electricity that will be delivered after a
certain period of time, even years into the future.

Trading in the Spot and Intraday markets splits a calendar day into 48 time frames (30
minute-slots). It offers two more contract options: the Day-Ahead Day Time (slots
between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.), and Day-Ahead Peak Time (1 p.m. to 4 p.m.).

To trade on JEPX, membership as an affiliate is required. Separate pricing is set for
each of Japan’s nine major grid areas (excluding Okinawa): Hokkaido, Tohoku, Tokyo,
Chubu, Hokuriku, Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu. The price is formed on the
basis of contracted transactions, rather than bids. Participants cannot see the bids of
other parties.


Until 2016, trading volumes on JEXP were small, accounting for just 2% of Japan’s
total generation. This changed dramatically in 2016 both due to full market
liberalization, which saw new retail-focused entrants in the market, and thanks to the
concerted efforts of METI. The ministry asked major utilities to sell part of their
generation volumes via the exchange.

Trade volume reached 318.5 TWh last year, equivalent to 40.1% of all electric power
sold nationwide in FY2023. JEPX is a private exchange managed by a general
incorporated association of electric power companies and other such entities.

Futures market
Trading in electricity futures was introduced to hedge the risk of electricity price
fluctuations. Tokyo Commodity Exchange, or TOCOM, was the first to launch an
electricity futures marketplace in Japan in September 2019. It’s now a subsidiary of
the Japan Exchange Group (JPX), which handles all equity trading and is now
pioneering carbon credit trading.

Alongside power futures, TOCOM offers futures and options contracts for rubber,
gold, silver, crude oil, gasoline, gas oil, kerosene, platinum and palladium. The
exchange handles mainly physically delivered transactions, but in the case of futures
contracts, physical delivery does not take place.

TOCOM’s start in electricity futures was followed by a similar offering from the
European Energy Exchange (EEX). While the German exchange operator launched its
Japan futures marketplace a year later, it has been able to expand the business much
faster, in part thanks to its international background and the experience of running
power futures in a number of EU countries and elsewhere, introducing clients from
other markets to its Japanese offering.

23

As a result, EEX had a 92% market share for electricity trading as of 2023. It features a
wide range of products for power trading on derivatives markets.

Within three years of running its Japan operations, EEX has established a dominant
position in electricity futures, and as of May 16, 2024 it has managed to grow the
number of trading participants to 74 with 40 international companies among the
registered trading members. These are almost evenly split between domestic power
utilities and overseas traders, utilities, financial companies and others. Japan is the
first derivatives platform that the EEX has built in Asia.

The EEX trading volume in Japan power futures nearly doubled during 2023 from the
previous year and hit a record in February 2024, when around 6.5 TWh was traded in
a single month. The exchange has facilitated close to 20.8 TWh of trades in the year
to date as of April 24. That’s already more than the entire volume traded on the EEX
in 2023 (18.3 TWh). In the course of 2020-2022, EEX volumes were just 13.9 TWh, so
the growth has been extremely robust.

Monthly Number of EEX Trades and Traded Volume in Lots and MWh

TOCOM splits its futures into baseload and peak load contracts, and also East and
West grid areas. The exchange has daily and weekly contracts, as well as the monthly
offerings that attract most of the attention.

While TOCOM has lagged EEX in volumes, it also saw a surge in trading this spring
after introducing the so-called Market Maker System. Several financial and trading
institutions, acting as providers of liquidity, helped to promote more active
dealmaking for the July-September 2024 contract period when demand for electricity
will be at its peak, which increased liquidity by a factor of more than eight.

Monthly Electricity trading volumes on the TOCOM (MWh)















Source: TOCOM

TOCOM currently has 44 trading participants in its power futures markets, most of
which are major power utilities and trading houses, such as Itochu, Marubeni and
Mitsui & Co. Last year’s trading volume was 15,374 lots, a drop from 24,746 in 2022.
It is unclear what this translates into on a kilowatt-hours basis as TOCOM does not
disclose this information. However, based on the monthly trading volume graph
TOCOM presented to METI earlier this year, the exchange saw annual volumes little
changed last year compared to 2022. In contrast, TOCOM’s share of the electricity
futures market seems to have declined from over 30% in 2022 to around 1% in late
2023.

capacity for the future, began in 2020. The market is overseen by the Organization for
Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission (OCCTO) that was established in 2015,
one year prior to market liberalization.

Transactions in the capacity market, which are auction-based, are made four years
before the actual trade. The contract price is set at the intersection of the supply and
demand curves, with bidding prices arranged in ascending order. Capacity contracts
for 2024, signed in 2020, totaled 167.69 GW in volume and were priced at ¥14,137/
kW. Most of the tender winners since 2020 have been thermal power generators.

From the start of this year, OCCTO also launched an offshoot capacity auction system
for low carbon generation sources. The conditions of that auction are different in that
they offer a fixed 20-year contract, but ask successful bidders to return 90% of the
profit made from other income streams. This new Long-Term Decarbonization Power
Source auction is for clean energy facilities that are not subjected to the FIT or FIP
regimes.

OCCTO also operates a balancing market to manage supply and demand. This
platform was established in FY2021 to facilitate procurement and operation of cross-
regional reserve balancing capacity. With participation of renewable energy
generators, the market serves as a platform to procure electricity that balances out
miscalculations in estimates for energy supply and demand.

Further reforms
METI is currently discussing ways to integrate some of the trading platforms and wants
to link the futures and spot transactions in the electricity market. There are tentative
plans to launch a one-stop trading mechanism by the end of 2025 involving TOCOM
and JEPX. The new service, currently titled JJ-Link, would allow JEPX spot
transactions to mirror TOCOM future positions.

The mechanism depends on TOCOM receiving contract data from JEPX, facilitating
the matching of spot and futures positions, and alerting the power companies
concerned. If this works, it would allow the placement of orders for JEPX power
delivery trades via TOCOM, thus improving its trading efficiency and increasing
liquidity.

JJ-Link is also a way of correlating power futures, a hedging tool, with current
accounting practices in Japan. Proponents say that it would make hedge accounting
applicable to futures transactions.


With this effort to unify markets, METI is looking to improve the efficiency and liquidity
of Japan’s electricity trading, aiming to make it an ecosystem suitable for both energy
specialists and financial institutions. The market’s growth is seen as a way of
incentivizing new investments in clean energy sources while smoothing out disruptions
to power supply due to weather, technology, politics or corporate action.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Asia / Oil
The profit from turning a barrel of crude oil into fuels in Asia is at the lowest in seven
months, leading refiners to turn away from expensive Middle East grades and seek
cheaper alternatives from the Americas.

Australia / Renewable energy
The government allocated about A$14 billion in its 2024-25 budget to help the
country become a “renewable energy superpower” over the next decade.

China / Azerbaijan
Azerbaijan’s Minister of Energy met with a Chinese delegation led by the head of
China Energy Engineering Group and the head of China Energy International Group.
The meeting focused on cooperation in renewable energy.

China / Fossil fuels
In 2023, in order to meet rising electricity demand due to poor hydropower
conditions, China generated 65%, or 6,102 TWh, of its electricity from fossil fuels, said
energy think tank Ember. About 60% of China’s total power generation came from
coal, which is above the global average of 35%. China accounted for over half of total
global coal generation.

China / LNG
China's LNG imports could hit record levels in 2024. The country is already the world's
top LNG importer, and this year will buy up to 80 MMT, driven by high demand from
the industrial and commercial sectors.

India / Coal
The share of coal in the country’s power sector dropped to less than 50% for the first
time since the 1960s. In Q1, India added a record-breaking 13.67 GW of power
generation capacity, with renewable energy accounting for 71.5% of this new
capacity.

Nuclear power
In 2023, nuclear power globally rebounded from a five-year low, increasing 1.8% YoY
to reach 2,686 TWh. The U.S. was the largest electricity producer from nuclear at 775
TWh; China (435 TWh), and France (336 TWh). These three account for 58% of the
global total.

Pakistan / Renewable energy
Oracle Power and its green energy developer firm, Oracle Energy, will develop 1.3
GW of renewable energy, to be located in Jhimpir, Sindh Province. It comprises 800
MW of solar and 500 MW of wind power.

centers, to a JV of Indonesian chemicals firm PT Chandra Asri and global trading
house Glencore.

Taiwan / Renewable energy
Taiwan completed the review of 2024 renewable energy feed-in tariffs. The rates for
solar PV dropped slightly from last year, while wind and hydropower remained the
same or rose slightly.
