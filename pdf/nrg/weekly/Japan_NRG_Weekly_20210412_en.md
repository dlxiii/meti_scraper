NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Govt. panel recommends allowing coal-fired plants with 43% efficiency to operate post 2030

(Asia Nikkei, April 10)
•  A METI committee recommended to the government to allow coal-fired power plants to operate
beyond 2030 if they have an energy efficiency ratio of 43% or higher. This is seen as a very high
target by the industry and is supposed to encourage utilities to make upgrades to make sure only
the cleanest-burning coal plants remain in service.
•  The 43% figure is at the top of what coal power plants today can achieve. Just two facilities in
Japan met that benchmark in FY2019. A further 31 were at 40% or higher.
•  METI does not plan to hand out penalties to companies that fail to meet the new benchmark. The

ministry will also give guidance to companies on how to achieve the new standards.
•  CONTEXT: Japan asks power companies to maintain an efficiency rate of 44.3% across all thermal
power, including LNG and oil. Most utilities would need to upgrade current facilities to increase
their coal efficiency numbers.
•  CONTEXT: Coal-fired capacity accounted for 32% of total in FY2019, second-highest after LNG.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMEN:

METI committee sees 43%-44% efficiency level optimal for USC coal
(Japan NRG, April 10)
o  A separately METI committee discussed setting efficiency levels at 43% to 44% for USC
coal-fired technology and 46% for IGCC at a meeting on March 22.
• TAKEAWAY: Since METI’s announcement in the summer of 2020 that it will seek to close all “inefficient” coal
capacity by 2030 there have been continuing arguments among bureaucrats and experts as to what constitutes

“efficient” and how many facilities should be allowed to close. Japan NRG has covered several of the
committees dealing with the issue, all of which tried to provide a methodology that won some and had others
in the industry furious. Having one simple number apply across the entire industry seems like a fair approach.
• However, this panel recommendation, should it be accepted by METI, will also have plenty of opponents. For

one, many utilities have started to experiment with co-firing – using two fuels at one power plant, and
aggregating the energy efficiency. Biomass has been the most popular second fuel for coal plants with the
major Japanese utilities. However, so far, most of these coal plants use only about 2% to 4% biofuel. It’s
possible that raising the percentage to 10% or so will be enough to boost the overall efficiency numbers of the
coal-fired facility and have it meet the new 43% threshold. The same could be said of adding ammonia as the
second fuel, or in the future hydrogen.

• As a result, Japan could end up keeping a large portion of its 150 coal-firing units, at least as reserve capacity.
The second fuel would help “rebrand” coal plants and suggest that they are transition facilities that will switch
to ammonia-only or biofuel-only at a later date. Should this occur, Japan’s demand for LNG is likely to keep
declining. The other major question, however, is what happens to emissions.

• Keeping the bulk of the coal plants, Japan will likely struggle to significantly cut the energy sector’s CO2 in the
medium term.

Make nuclear power official policy says LDP lobby
(Nikkei editorial, April 5)
•  A group of LDP Diet members will soon begin lobbying the government to amend its energy
policy to endorse the building of new nuclear power stations and the replacement of existing

stations.
•  Led by prominent Diet members Amari Akira and Nukaga Fukushiro, the pro-nuclear group will
first convene on April 12. It says nuclear energy is the key to decarbonizing industry and ensuring
Japan’s energy security.
•  Stressing recent safety advances, the group says it is time for the government to take the lead and
endorse nuclear power.
•  Prime Minister Suga has maintained that his government currently has no plans to build more

nuclear power plants.
• TAKEAWAY: There has been very little open support for nuclear power among politicians in the last 10 years.
However, the industry has been a somewhat upward trajectory in the last few months and the fact that the
Fukushima accident has now passed its 10th anniversary mark suggests the public attention to it may start to
wane.




Biden and Suga to draw up guidelines for hydrogen power infrastructure
(Nikkei, April 6)
•  As Japan PM Suga travels to the U.S. to meet President Biden, the two sides are preparing to
reach agreement on guidelines for future infrastructure in fields like hydrogen power, as well as 5G
and others.




Government imposes stricter requirements on “green” claims
(Kankyo Business, April 2)
•  Under a new set of guidelines issued by METI on April 1, electricity retailers will need to disclose
their carbon offsetting arrangements in order to be able to refer to themselves or their services as
“green”.
•  The move comes as the certification of the carbon neutrality of non-FIT electricity becomes law.




ENEOS brings green research plan forward 10 years
(Nikkei Xtech, April 1)
•  Japan’s petrochemical industry is battling falling demand for fuel. However, Eneos CEO Fujiyama

Yuichiro wants to turn adversity into opportunity. Eneos’ plan for the future focuses on carbon
reduction, digital technology, chemicals, and recycling, and nearly a third of the firm’s capital
investment between FY2020 and FY2022 will go into environmental projects.
•  Eneos brought its target for developing synthetic renewable fuels forward by 10 years in response
to the Japanese government’s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

•  The company is working to have a certifiable and commercially viable synthetic fuel on the market
sometime in the 2030s. It aims to achieve production capacity of 100 barrels of synthetic fuel per
day by 2025, ramping up to 10,000 barrels a day by 2030.




Seibu Railway launches carbon neutral train
(Kankyo Business, April 5)
•  In a national first, Seibu Railway made its Yamaguchi Line carbon neutral on April 1.
•  All electricity consumed by trains running on the Yamaguchi line is sourced from the company’s
Takeyama solar power station.
•  The Yamaguchi line used to be responsible for 300 metric tons of CO2 emissions a year.




IHI successfully burns 70% ammonia blend in gas turbine
(New Energy Business News, April 7)
•  IHI has developed a gas turbine in which liquid ammonia can be injected directly into the reactor
and burnt along with natural gas.
•  In a world first, the IHI engineers achieved stable operation while deriving up to 70% of total

energy from ammonia, and even had some success with burning pure ammonia.
•  While IHI successfully demonstrated operation on 20% blends (on an energy basis) in the past, the
high cost of modifying turbines to allow the injection of large volumes of liquid ammonia
presented an obstacle.
•  The latest breakthrough is the result of a collaboration with a team from Tohoku University who
had the idea of directly injecting ammonia in its liquid state, thereby eliminating the need for an

evaporation system.



Japanese prefectures vow to raise renewables component by themselves
(Various reports, April 10)
•  Kumamoto prefecture said it will aim to raise the percentage of electricity it derives from
renewables to 50% by 2030 from 20% at present.

•  The locality faced energy crises after the 2011 Fukushima accident and the 2016 Kyushu
earthquake. The government says that these events pointed to decentralized energy sources as
the best way forward to maintain security of energy supply.
•  Meanwhile, Okinawa prefecture said it aims to raise its renewables component to 16% by 2030
from just 6% at present.
•  CONTEXT: Okinawa is heavily reliant on coal-fired generation and is not connected to the power

grid of mainland Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: As more regional governments make commitments to raise the local share of renewables in the
mix, it makes it easier for the national government to raise the percentage in the long-term energy strategy of
Japan.

Residents’ group protests Tokushima wind farm as anti-renewables clamor grows
(NHK, April 5)
•  Many Tokushima residents have put their names to letter calling for the scrapping of plans to build
a wind farm in a mountainous part of the prefecture. The letter was officially submitted to Governor

Iijima.
•  Residents cite environmental destruction and the risk of landslides as reasons for their opposition
to the project.
•  The group is asking the Governor to take a position on the issue that more reflects the views of
experts and local residents.
• TAKEAWAY: Opposition to renewables projects in local areas has noticeably grown in recent years. The

number of local ordinances on solar and wind has jumped to 134 in FY2020 from 26 in FY2016. Most of it is
the NIMBY factor, but some are due to by falling solar panels and other accidents.



Japan startup to launch all-plastic lithium ion batteries this year
(Asia Nikkei, April 7)
•  APB, a Japanese startup, plans to start this year commercial production of a lithium-ion battery

made entirely from plastic. This is said to make the battery safer.
•  The batteries will be offered to wind and solar farms to store energy, according to APB founder, an
ex-Nissan engineer.
•  The battery uses special polymers that can conduct electricity. Polymers have higher resistance to
electrical currents, which means APB's batteries would not dramatically heat up.




Sumitomo Corporation explores agricultural uses for unwanted carbon dioxide
(Nikkei, April 8)
•  Sumitomo Corporation has partnered with American start-up Indigo Ag, which has pioneered the
sale of carbon credits for CO2 used for agricultural purposes.
•  By reducing fertilizer use, farmers are able to increase the amount of CO2 taken up by the soil.
•  While the Paris Agreement on climate change recognizes the importance of soil as a carbon sink,

the difficulty of measuring the amount of CO2 dissolved in the soil had been a barrier to emissions
trading.
•  Indigo Ag’s methodology has been accredited under the Verified Carbon Standard.



Hitachi launches emissions calculation service

(New Energy Business News, April 9)
•  Hitachi has launched a new service that helps corporations calculate their CO2 emissions with the
aim of improving their ESG scores.
•  While calculating carbon emissions has traditionally been a time-consuming task, the new system
automates the collation of data and the calculation of supply chain carbon footprints. The system is
also able compatible with Carbon Disclosure Project reporting and accreditation in respect to
Science-Based Targets.

(New Energy Business News, April 7)
•  Trina Solar has begun accepting orders for a new solar module that can generate a record 670 W
per panel, an improvement of 34% over conventional 500 W panels.
•  In a further innovation, the new panels will be shipped flat, as opposed to on their sides, to
overcome restrictions presented by the height of shipping containers. This will allow a 12%
increase in the generation capacity that can be shipped in a single container, thereby reducing
transport costs.




Itochu and Hitachi Zosen secure financing for $900 million Dubai waste-to-energy project
(New Energy Business News, April 8)
•  Itochu and Hitachi Zosen Inova entered into a $900 million financing agreement for a project to
build a waste fired power plant in Dubai, along with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Mizuho Bank, Societe Generale, KfW IPEX Bank, Standard

Chartered Bank, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, and Siemens Bank.
•  Work will begin on the plant later this month and construction completed in 2024. Located in the
Warsan area, the plant will process 1.9 million metric tons of waste every year, while generating
around 200 MW of electricity.

•  Chubu Electric is currently the leading developer of biomass power, using it as a co-firing solution
for coal-fired power plants. The utility is building a 1 GW second unit at the Misumi power plant
which will burn both biomass and coal.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Chubu Electric, Hiroshima Gas start operations at a 112 MW biomass plant

(New Energy Business News, April 7)
o  Kaita Biomass Power Co., a joint venture between Chubu Electric and Hiroshima Gas, has
started commercial operations at its coal-wood biomass co-firing 112 MW power plant in
Hiroshima prefecture.
o  The plant is on the FIT pricing scheme and sources 80% of its fuel from local waste
timber and woody biomass such as white pellets and palm coconut shells from overseas.

The other 20% of the fuel is coal.
• TAKEAWAY: A consortium Chubu Electric is invested in has also just started construction of a 75 MW biomass
power plant in Nagoya city, Aichi prefecture. The plant will start generating power in July 2023. These kinds of
JVs and consortiums allow Chubu Electric to clock up capacity that can be counted towards its renewables
targets without doing the heavy lifting of pushing through the project. We would expect EPCOs to remain a
back-seat driver in renewables projects unless they hit a certain capacity level of at least 200 MW or so.




Japan’s JGC invests in U.S. small modular reactor builder NuScale to develop the technology
(Nikkei, April 5)
•  JGC, one of Japan’s biggest engineering firms, will join a U.S. project to build a 600 MW to 700
MW small modular reactor (SMR). JGC will invest $40 million for a 3% stake in NuScale Power, a
company that designs SMRs.
•  JGC will help to build NuScale’s first SMR reactor in Idaho.

•  NuScale’s design involves immersing the containment units in a pool of water, which is seen as a
safety feature that can prevent reactor meltdowns. The company also believes it can complete the
construction of a SMR project for considerably less than the cost of a larger-scale traditional
nuclear reactor design.
•  NuScale is majority owned by Fluor, a U.S. engineering firm.
• TAKEAWAY: With public opposition to nuclear power remaining strong in Japan, the government has tried to

avoid making positive statements about building more nuclear reactors in the future. However, in the new
Green Growth Strategy, nuclear power does feature with SMR and another design named as the most
promising next generation nuclear tech. JGC’s investment represents the first visible Japanese involvement in
the creation of SMRs.

Government to discharge Fukushima nuclear site’s treated water into the ocean
(NHK, April 9)
•  The government will approve the release into the ocean of water stored on the site of the

Fukushima nuclear disaster. Related ministries will meet on April 13 to officially approve the
discharge.
•  The government says it will monitor changes in radiation levels and fully compensate those
affected by negative publicity about the discharge.
•  This is water from the Fukushima site that has been treated to remove most of its radioactive
elements. One element that is impossible to remove, however, is tritium.

•  The release of wastewater into the ocean will begin in about two years. Levels of tritium oxide
(water in which the hydrogen atoms have been replaced with radioactive tritium) will be seven
times lower than the maximum permitted by the WHO, the Japanese government says.
•  METI Minister Kajiyama has stressed the importance of transparency in the process, while the
Minister of Agriculture Nogami stressed the importance of considering the demands of local

fisheries operators.
•  Meanwhile, Environment Minister Koizumi cautioned against delaying the release of the water any
further, saying delays would jeopardize efforts to rebuild Fukushima.

Toshiba buyout offer from CVC raises concern about fate of its nuclear assets

(Japan NRG, April 9)
•  Luxembourg-based private equity fund CVC has made an offer to buy all of Toshiba, taking one of
Japan’s iconic engineering companies private. The offer is said to be at 30% above the market
price of Toshiba before news of the offer was published. It is seen as a response by Toshiba CEO,
a former CVC executive, to extract the company from the ongoing scandals with current
shareholders, which include activist funds Effissimo and others.
•  CVC, as any foreign buyer of a Japanese firm listed as strategic, will need to get clearance from
the government’s regulators. METI, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Defense will likely

be key voices in the review, with Toshiba also a significant defense contractor.
•  A major question for the government will also be the fate of Toshiba’s nuclear assets. It is one of
only three domestic nuclear reactor vendors to Japanese power plants and is also in charge of
maintenance. Toshiba’s nuclear equipment is used by TEPCO, Tohoku Electric and Chubu Electric,
and the company provides its nuclear services via the Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions unit.
•  A carve-out of the nuclear assets may be necessary for a foreign fund to take control of Toshiba,

with regulators likely to see this as a particularly sensitive issue. However, any split would require
there being a willing buyer. In recent years, major Japanese engineering companies have been
either exiting the nuclear business or minimizing its part of their operations and few remain fully
committed to this energy sector.
•  The Chairman of the ruling LDP’s Policy Research Council, Shimomura has already told media that
the government will be interesting to see if CVC intends to interfere with Toshiba’s management.

|  | Chairman of the ruling LDP’s Policy Research Council, Shimomura has already told media that |
| --- | --- |
| the government will be interesting to see if CVC intends to interfere with Toshiba’s management. |  |

•  CVC told Toshiba that it expects to partner with JIC (Japan Investment Corp, a state backed fund
that is also involved in the acquisition of Hitachi Construction Machinery) and Development Bank
of Japan in the deal. Other domestic firms that have some synergies with Toshiba may get
involved, according to CVC.
• TAKEAWAY: It would be very surprising if CVC has gone into such a monumental deal without first sounding

out the reaction of Japanese government officials. This would suggest that at least a part of the bureaucracy
would like to make the deal happen. We expect the reason for it is to act as a step in a broader restructuring of
the nuclear assets of Japan. If nuclear is to remain one of the energy sources beyond the next couple of
decades, Japan must start planning and implementing the construction of more reactors. Most of the current
facilities are aging and will need to be phased out before 2050.

• However, the private sector has found it hard to retaining nuclear assets intact in the current environment. It
may be that the government has finally decided to come into the sector in a more noticeable capacity, or at
the very least pass over important nuclear assets to a trusted Japanese company that is wholly dedicated to
nuclear energy development. If Japan’s nuclear industry is to survive and thrive, it needs a positive business
leader. At the moment, such a company is lacking.

Japan’s oil products demand forecast to drop 5.7% by 2025; fuel oil worst hit
(Japan NRG, April 6)
•  METI has published its forecasts for Japan's oil products demand over the next five years. The
ministry’s expert group on the subjects expects total demand for all oil products (apart from Type

C heavy oil used in power generation) to drop by 5.7% to 143.82 million kiloliters in FY2025,
compared with FY2021.
•  Compared with pre-Covid demand in FY2019, the drop will be even bigger – close to 10%. Japan
used 159.54 million kiloliters of oil products in FY2019.
•  Gasoline demand is expected to be among the worst hit, dropping 9.3% in FY2025 from the
expected FY2021 level. It will be down 14.26% from FY2019.
•  The smallest decline is expected in jet fuel, with FY2025 forecasts only slightly below FY2019 levels

and up massively on the COVID-affected FY2020 / FY2021 levels.
• TAKEAWAY: METI’s calculations, which also include figures for naphtha, kerosene, light crude and others,
assume that Japan’s GDP will continue to grow at a healthy pace. This makes the demand drop predicated
mainly on the move toward carbon neutrality in the power generation and industrial sectors, as well as
transport. Demographics will also continue to play a role.

• With such a strong demand drop in most oil products, and gasoline in particular, it’s clear that further oil
refinery closures or curtailments in Japan are inevitable. For a full picture of the situation, see our Analysis
piece from Oct. 5, 2020.



Shipper Mitsui OSK to spend $1.8B on decarbonization with LNG tankers
(Nikkei, April 6)
•  Japanese shipping firm Mitsui OSK Lines plans to spend ¥200 billion ($1.8 billion) over three years

to cut its CO2 emissions, and aims to hit net-zero emissions by 2050.
•  Part of this plan involves switching to ships fueled by LNG, especially for large vessels such as car
carriers and crude oil tankers.

•  It’s expected that about 30% to 40% of Mitsui OSK’s fleet will run on LNG within the next 10 years,
and President Hashimoto said he believes LNG to be the leading fuel of the 2020s.
•  Further in the future, the shipper will need to switch to hydrogen and ammonia, Hashimoto added.
LNG only cuts emissions by 30% compared with the current fuel of choice – heavy fuel oil.
•  The shipper may also invest in wind power, especially in offshore wind, to help it reduce its

emissions further.
•  CONTEXT: The co. originally planned to achieve net-zero by 2100.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite concerns about the climate credential of gas in Europe, most of Asia views LNG as the
next realistic step towards a low carbon society, and the transition of major Japanese shippers to LNG
illustrates this broader trend. Even the green lobby in Japan supports LNG as a partner for renewables, much
more than it supports a wider rollout of hydrogen at this stage. The potential for shippers to get involved in

offshore wind projects is also an area to watch.

Chevron and Hokkaido Gas sign five-year LNG supply agreement

(Company statement, April 7)
•  Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Singapore Branch) has signed a binding Sale and Purchase Agreement with

portfolio to the Hokkaido area.
•  Under the agreement, CUSA will supply Hokkaido Gas with about a half million tons of LNG over a
period of five years starting April 2022.

• TAKEAWAY: This relatively small deal is significant because it shows Chevron’s interest in securing a new client
in Japan, one that traditionally may have procured all of its gas via Tokyo Gas, as well as the trading houses
Mitsui and Mitsubishi. It’s also a multi-year deal in a market that has been largely moving towards spot or
short-term contracts in the last year or so. Even a small amount locked in over time seems like a good deal for
Chevron. This agreement also shows that Hokkaido, which has traditionally resisted switching from coal citing
geographical and grid connection issues, may be getting more serious about gas generation.

ANALYSIS

Japan considers boosting LNG stockpiles
Via overseas hubs and diplomacy

Japan has fewer than three weeks of gas supply on-hand, and even less when it
comes to the reserve for power generation. For a country that relies on LNG for
around 40% of its power, that’s a fine margin.

The unprecedented spike in LNG prices in January, coupled with shipping problems
that made quick delivery of the fuel nigh impossible, revived a long-running concern
among Japanese bureaucrats that this just-in-time supply system needs an overhaul.

The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) has once again put forward the
idea of creating an LNG stockpile for Japan, similar to the oil reserves created in the
wake of the 1970s crude supply shock. Rather than touting trillions-yen investments in
underground repositories, however, this time ANRE is proposing a novel approach: a
geographically diversified reserves network.


Multiple supply shocks in the last year
The common view among Japanese energy officials has traditionally been that gas is a
less risky commodity. The country relies on the Middle East for around 80% of its oil
supply – an acknowledged geopolitical risk in the world’s No. 4 importer. In contrast,
Japan’s 75 million tons of LNG last year was sourced from 15 countries, with Asia-
Pacific supplies accounting for over 60% of total.

That traditional wisdom was subjected to several shocks in the last year. Last summer,
the COVID-19 pandemic held up passage of LNG cargos from the U.S. The price rally
at the end of last year, which peaked at $32.494/ MMBtu on Jan. 12, was driven as
much by the sudden jump in demand in Asia as by a shortage of available ships. Then,
last month, a cargo ship stuck in the Suez Canal stranded dozens of LNG carriers,
delaying delivery by days if not weeks.

Supply disruptions at individual LNG projects are common. Problems in transport that
affect large swathes of the supply network on a regular basis is a recent trend that had
even LNG suppliers like Tellurian calling for more efforts and investments in gas
storage infrastructure around the world.

In Japan, the idea of adding physical storage has long been unpopular with the
private sector. Five years ago, ANRE proposed creating underground storage in the
depleted gas fields of Niigata prefecture. The idea received backing form the Niigata
government, but relied on changes to gas safety regulation to allow the pumping of
gas into underground caverns.

The scheme never materialized because it required large investments and there were
questions over the safety of such repositories. Further questions arose over who
would cover ongoing costs. In the end, the Niigata proposal and broader national
LNG stockpiles idea were shelved.

This February, the energy agency returned with a new plan. While details are scant, it
seems Niigata storage is no longer part of it. Both the local government and Japan
Petroleum Exploration (JAPEX), which pumps gas in the Niigata area, said building
storage in Niigata is not feasible. It would require major spending at a time when the
bulk of public and private money is going to decarbonization initiatives.

Instead, ANRE wants to create across the region a diversified network of storage
facilities for LNG, as well as oil products, which could offer members fuel in an
emergency. As the cause of recent disruptions was delivery, rather than production,
bureaucrats see an effective solution in better management of transport and
geographical diversity.

An overseas storage network would also create further demand for Japanese LNG
storage tanks and would appeal to domestic steelmakers, engineering firms and
construction companies, according to Kawabata Tomoya, an engineering professor at
Tokyo University.

“Japanese companies have cutting edge LNG tank technologies,” Kawabata said.


Hosting the stockpiles offshore?
A few small building blocks for this network have already formed. ANRE said that
Kuwait, Vietnam and the Philippines have agreed to be part of such a pan-Asia energy
stockpile.

Last December, Japan and Kuwait announced the creation of a joint petroleum
reserve for Asia. Housed on Japanese soil, the 3.14-million-barrel stockpile is meant to
act as a buffer against supply disruptions in Southeast Asia. Japan does, however,
have priority access to the reserve.

The energy agency is cagey about revealing further details on how a pan-Asian
stockpile mechanism for LNG would work or where bases would be located. The
broader vision is to support the build-out of LNG stockpile infrastructure in Asia, such
as helping others to install more tanks and pipelines that would carry gas from ports
to tanks to consumers. Japan is also a major manufacturer of LNG carriers.

Back at home, Japan has its own infrastructure problems should a pan-Asian LNG
network materialize. For one, Japan too lacks a nationwide gas pipeline system to
move the fuel between regions. Smaller ports cannot handle the ultra-chilled
commodity. Also, the country’s LNG storage capacities are limited to just 14 days for
utilities and 20 days for Tokyo Gas. This adds to the complexity of quickly moving fuel
across the country in case of emergency.

Ignoring the problem, or pointing to the difficulty of storing gas, which evaporates
over time, is no longer an option. In addition to supply disruptions, Japan’s increasing
reliance on renewables necessitates more baseload power capacity on hand to cover
intermittency issues. Until sufficient battery storage or other means are available, the
potential for a drop in wind or solar power must be covered with other energy
sources. Without coal or nuclear, Japan’s options would narrow to LNG.

One practical alternative to building more pipelines and underground storage
facilities would be to locate some LNG stockpiles on offshore platforms, Kawabata
said.

As ammonia and hydrogen take over the government’s agenda, planning more and
more, ANRE knows it has to look for creative rather than costly solutions to LNG
storage at a time when the fuel’s delivery risk-rating is rising.

ANRE’s aspirations lie in persuading more neighboring countries to share LNG supply
risks. It would then fall on Japan’s diplomatic efforts to ensure its Asian neighbors are
willing to share the fuel in times of a national emergency.

Japan Accelerates Support for Emission Cuts Overseas,
Coining Joint Credits Worth 1.5% of Own GHG Emissions

As Japan looks for ways to improve its emissions reduction targets ahead of this year’s
COP26 climate conference, one ace up the government’s sleeve may be the
increasing number of carbon-reducing projects it is sponsoring abroad. Most of them
will generate credits that Japan could use to offset its own emissions total.

In the past year, Japan has notably widened the flow of projects getting approved
under schemes such as the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), which support efforts to
lower the carbon footprints of developing economies.

Such activity has boosted the total expected reduction in greenhouse gases (GHG)
that Japan can claim from JCM alone to 17.9 million tons by 2030. That’s equivalent
to 1.48% of the Japan’s GHG total for FY2019 – a small, but not insignificant volume.

By 2030, Japan hopes to register enough JCM projects to cut emissions by 100
million tons of CO2 equivalent. What’s more, the credits forged through JCM carry
monetary value.

What is JCM?
JCM is an offshoot of the “Joint Implementation” (JI) mechanism that was devised
under the Kyoto Protocol and expanded at later COP meetings to include the “Clean
Development Mechanism”. In short, the latter motivates richer countries to reduce
global emissions faster by allowing them to sponsor work that lowers CO2 levels in
developing nations. Generally, this makes it cheaper to cut 1 ton of global emissions.
It also facilitates clean energy technology transfer to developing nations. In return,
project sponsors are rewarded with credits, which countries can use to reduce their
own GHG total.

Japan proposed the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) to the UN in 2013. It is a
project-based bilateral offset crediting mechanism that aims to facilitate the diffusion
of low-carbon technologies.

Financial support under the JCM is provided through the government, affiliated
organizations, and the Asia Development Bank (ADB). Environment Ministry is in
charge of the majority of JCM projects, although METI is also involved in the scheme.

Partner countries:
Since rolling out JCM in 2015, Japan has partners with 17 countries in the scheme.
These are: Mongolia, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Maldives, Viet Nam, Lao PDR,
Indonesia, Costa Rica, Palau, Cambodia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Chile, Myanmar,
Thailand and the Philippines.

Project volume:
As of February, 2021, the JCM scheme has 66 registered projects. It has issued credits
to 37 projects, and overseen financing to more than 180 projects.

Are JCM tradable?
JCM was created as a nontradable crediting mechanism, yet from the start Asia
Development Bank said that JCM could become tradable “at a future date.” Today,
the Environment Ministry says on its website that JCM credit transactions are possible,
but need to be conducted through the JCM registry. JCM credits cannot be
transferred internationally, so “for companies based overseas to trade credits, it is
necessary to open an account in the JCM registry in Japan.” However, the ministry
notes that government will not be a buyer of JCM credits issued to project
participants.

What do companies get out of this?
Japanese companies can use the mechanism to get subsidies for up to half of the
expenses associated with realizing energy-improvement work abroad. Companies can
also use credits to offset their own GHG calculations, but the same credit cannot be
used both by the government and the corporate.

Decarbonizing Japan – abroad
In the five years of running the JCM scheme, Japan has registered 66 projects that
qualify for the credits. Of those, 26 were selected in FY2020, a jump from the annual
average of 10 projects from prior years.

A further 23 projects have applied for registration, according to the JCM directory.
The start of the selection process for this fiscal year, FY2021, begins in early May and
will last until the end of October.

Most of the projects chosen last year are based in Asia and involve the installation of
solar panels at existing industrial facilities. A typical example is Idemitsu adding 2MW
of roof-mounted PV to a pellet factory in Vietnam, which makes fuel for biomass
power plants. The panels will be operational next year.

However, there is also Marubeni’s utility-scale 400 MW solar plant in Saudi Arabia,
which is due to generate one of the biggest CO2 reductions of the FY2020 selection
(See Table at the end for project details).

Another major cut in emissions is attributed to a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries plan to
build a 29 MW geothermal power facility in the Philippines. An Italian unit of the
Japanese group will add a binary geothermal OCR generator to an existing power
plant on Luzon island, which will be able to utilize waste heat to save 72,200 tons of
emissions a year.

Projects that promote switching from coal to gas can also qualify. Trading house Sojitz
and Osaka Gas are helping Japanese instant noodle maker Acecook move its Vietnam
manufacturing operations to gas-fired generation from this summer. New high-
efficiency boilers at Acecook factories will be able to run on LPG as well as natural
gas, saving an estimated 76,300 tons of emissions over 10 years.

Of course, some projects may not materialize, in which case their credits and CO2
reduction would not country. One example of a project that may have trouble in
fulfilling its commitments is an energy saving urban redevelopment in Yangon,

Myanmar, also registered in FY2020. The country’s recent military coup and escalating
internal conflict leaves the future all energy developments uncertain.

Still, the escalation in the number of Japanese companies pursuing energy
improvement projects overseas and the government’s interest in cutting emissions
quickly and cheaply bodes well for the future of JCM and similar mechanisms. They
may not help Japan cancel out all of its 1.213 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent in
annual emissions (as per FY2019). Still, they may well knock off a few percentage
points. In a race to drastically lower emissions within this decade, those few percent
may well prove useful.

GLOBAL       VIEW

BY TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices.

UAE Nuclear Power:
In a historic first for the Arab World, the UAE connected the country’s and the Arab
World’s first nuclear power plant to the grid last week. The Barakah Nuclear Power
Plant’s four nuclear reactors are forecast to supply up to 25% of the UAE’s electricity
needs and save the country up to 21 million tons of CO2 emissions a year.
The NPP consists of four APR-1400 reactors with a total capacity of 5.6 GW and is
situated on the Persian Gulf. The plant was built by Korea Electric Power (KEPCO) for
$20 billion and was delivered on time and on budget. Construction started a decade
ago.

Japan’s METI also announced on Thursday that it will work with the UAE on
technology to produce hydrogen including the creation of an international supply
chain. A memorandum of cooperation has been signed.


















U.S. CO2 Reduction Goals:
The Biden administration is expected to announce a climate goal later this month of
cutting U.S. carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. The goal should move the U.S. into a
global leadership role on climate change with a transformative shift away from the use
of fossil fuels in energy and transport.

Gina McCarthy, the White House National Climate Adviser, is developing U.S. climate
commitments for 2030 ahead of a virtual global climate summit on Earth Day, Apr. 22,
which will be hosted by President Biden. Over 40 heads of state are expected to
attend.

U.S. High Voltage (HV) Transmission:
Included in the recent Biden Infrastructure plan are investment tax credits for 20 GW
of HV transmission infrastructure. U.S. HV infrastructure capacity may need to triple by

2050 to accommodate the increased amount of renewable energy. The plan also calls
for the establishment of a Grid Deployment Authority within the DoE that would
streamline ‘rights of way’ issues.

Hydrogen:
Three companies in the U.S. Baker Hughes, Plug Power and Chart Industries – will
launch a fund focused on hydrogen-technology investments. Initial investments will
exceed $300 million and focus on production, storage, and distribution.

GHG Emissions in 2020:
Methane concentrations in 2020 rose YoY by 14.7 parts per billion, according to the
U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. CO2 concentrations rose to
412.5 per million although overall CO2 emissions were down 6% YoY due to the
pandemic. The 2020 increase in methane emissions represents the biggest increase
since record keeping began in 1983.

Uranium:
Uranium backed assets have soared 35% YTD on the back of increased need for
nuclear energy to meet decarbonization goals.

Lithium:
On May 3, CME will launch a futures contract for lithium hydroxide delivered to Japan,
South Korea, and China, taking advantage of increased demand by battery makers for
EV production.

Clean Steel:
Volvo has announced a collaboration with Swedish metals group SSAB to produce the
world’s first fossil-free steel. The steel will be produced using hydrogen.

Data Centers:
Applied Materials estimates that data centers will consume 15% of the world’s
electricity in 2025, up from 2% in 2020.

Aviation:
Lillium, the German electric air taxi service, is planning to raise $450 million through a
New York SPAC listing.

China:
All three Chinese oil and gas majors, CNOOC, Sinopec, Petrochina, have announced
plans to scale up natural gas investments. Sinpopec expects to spend $10 billion on
upstream gas exploration in 2021. Petrochina’s gas output now accounts for 47% of its
total production and it is planning to increase that to 55% by 2025. CNOOC also
plans to increase its gas production to 30% of total production by 2025.

South Korea:
Iran released an RoK oil tanker, the MT Hankuk Chemi, on Friday after holding it for
several months in Bandar Abbas for alleged environmental breaches committed in the
Persian Gulf.

Indonesia:
1). UAE became the first external investor in Indonesia’s recently launched sovereign
wealth fund committing $10 billion. Indonesian authorities hope to raise $100 billion

in total which will be used for energy, roads and port investments. Indonesia had
planned to move its capital from Java to Borneo starting in 2024 but the pandemic
has delayed those plans.
2). Over 150 people were killed when torrential rains caused by Tropical Cyclone
Seroja struck East Nusa Tengarra Province and East Timor on Monday also causing
power outages. Over 10,000 people were displaced.

Myanmar:
At a public event in Tokyo, an elected member of the Myanmar parliament, Dr. Sasa,
criticized the EU for weak sanctions and specifically mentioned that Total, the French
oil and gas major, with natural gas interests in Myanmar, should cease all royalty
payments to companies affiliated with the junta. He also criticized Japan for a weak
response to the Feb. 1 coup saying that Russian, Chinese and DPRK links with the
junta could threaten Japan’s security interests in the region. Most of Myanmar’s
natural gas exports go to Thailand and China. A Dutch pension fund is also calling for
South Korean conglomerate Posco to cut its ties with Myanmar. Posco operates a
steel JV with MEHL, a junta-controlled holding company.

India:
1). The government has asked domestic refiners to reduce dependence on Middle
East oil and reduce oil import costs. Imported oil cost India $80 billion in 2019 and
this is expected to triple to $250 billion by 2040. India has overtaken Japan as the
world’s third largest oil importer and consumer. India is exploring options with other
suppliers including Guyana, Iran, Kazakhstan and Russia.
2). Saudi Arabia’s Aramco is exploring options to buy a 20% stake in Reliance
Industry’s oil business as well as investments in a JV to build a 1.2 mbpd oil refinery in
India.

Iran:
1). Progress at the Vienna JCPOA discussions may result in the lifting of some oil
sanctions before the presidential election on Jun. 18.
2). An Iranian vessel, the Saviz, thought to be controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard, was attacked in the Red Sea on Tuesday in what appears to be tit-for-tat
strikes on seaborne vessels between Israel and Iran.

Saudi Arabia:
Aramco is considering selling a 49% stake in the Saudi national oil pipeline network to
Chinese investors for between $10 to $15 billion.

Iraq:
The U.S. committed to the withdrawal of all combat forces from OPEC’s second
largest oil producer at a date yet to be determined.

Ethiopia:
Ethiopia, Egypt, Sudan failed to reach an agreement on the $5 billion Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance Hydroelectric Dam at DRC-sponsored talks on Tuesday. Egypt has
threatened military action against Ethiopia if any Nile waters are diverted. Ethiopia is
planning to fill the dam in July and start electricity production in August.

Egypt:
The Suez Canal Authority continues to hold the Japanese-owned Ever Green vessel
and is demanding compensation exceeding $1 billion.

South Africa:
Anglo American, the mining group, will demerge its South African thermal coal
operation into a new company called Thungela Resources that will be listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Norway:
The country’s $1.3 trillion oil fund will pay $1.4 billion for a 50% stake in an offshore
wind farm operated by Denmark’s Orsted. This is part of a $14 billion allocation to RE
investments by the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund.

France:
The French government may buy out the minority shareholders (circa 15%) of EdF, the
world’s largest operator of nuclear assets, thereby fully nationalizing the company that
is listed on the Euronext Paris Exchange. EdF has a market capitalization of $44 billion.
EdF’s stock price rose by 10% on Tuesday.

UK:
BP is expected to cut its debt by $4 billion in Q4 when it reports Q1 results on Apr.
27. Disposal proceeds may also exceed $5 billion for the quarter including the sale of
a petrochemical business to Ineos. BP has committed to cut fossil fuel production by
40% by 2030.

Greenland:
The government in the Danish autonomous arctic island was ousted on Tuesday due
to objections to the development of a uranium mine by an Australian/Chinese
company, Greenland Minerals, in Kuannersuit, in the south of the island. Investments
exceeding $100 million have already been made in the Kvanefjeld mining project that
will now be terminated. President Trump had considered buying Greenland in 2019
but that offer was rejected by the Danish government.

U.S.:
1). The Texas state government is passing legislation that will require wind and solar
companies to purchase ancillary services, including replacement power, due to the
intermittency of these power sources.
2). Bank of America will commit $1.5 trillion to green finance by 2030, an increase of
$1 trillion.
3). BlackRock launched its ‘U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF Fund’ raising $1.25
billion, the largest ever ETF launch.
4). Over 30 lawsuits are now in progress in Texas relating to the Texas Freeze
including for natural gas price gouging during the emergency. A SoftBank subsidiary,
Fortress Investment, is thought to have made significant profits from the market
volatility. Royal Dutch Shell says the Texas disruption cost it $200 million in Q1.

South America:
Over two million hectares of Amazonian forest was lost to deforestation in 2020, the
third highest loss since 2000, and a 17% increase YoY. All four countries bordering the
Amazon, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil, recorded losses. Brazil accounted for 65%
of the loss. The EU is refusing to sign a trade agreement with the region unless the
deforestation is halted.
