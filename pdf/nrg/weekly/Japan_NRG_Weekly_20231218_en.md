Round 2 offshore wind auctions: winners of 1.4 GW of capacity announced

(Government statement, Dec 13)
•  METI announced the results for three of the four Round 2 offshore wind auctions. The highly-
anticipated auction saw three projects with a total of 1.4 GW in capacity all go to consortiums led
by Japanese trading houses (Itochu, Mitsui and Sumitomo).
•  For the first time in these auctions, an overseas company was among the parties in a winning
consortium.
o  Itochu’s project in Akita Pref includes JERA as a partner and covers 5,315-hectares off the

coast of Oga, Katagami and Akita cities. The 315 MW wind farm offered a zero-premium
price of ¥3/ kWh; it’s slated to begin operation in June 2028. The project will have 21
Vestas wind turbines (each 15 MW).
o  The second successful bid went to a consortium of Mitsui, RWE and Osaka Gas. It won
the 684 MW wind farm auction off the coast of Murakami-Tainai in Niigata Pref (9,200
hectares). It plans to begin operation in June 2029. It will use 38 GE turbines (each 18

MW). The price at a zero premium is designated at ¥3/ kWh. Capacity was decisive in the
winning bid, as rivals had all proposed to use 15 MW Vestas turbines.
o  The third auction win went to Sumitomo and TEPCO’s renewable power unit for a 420
MW wind farm off the coast of Eno Island in Saikai City, Nagasaki Pref. It will cover 3,984
hectares, with 28 Vestas turbines (15 MW each), and will launch in August 2029. Its rate is
¥22.18/ kWh.
•  While the govt didn’t disclose the costs of the projects, the total across four sites is estimated at ¥1

trillion. The results for the fourth site — off Happo and Noshiro towns in Akita Pref — will be
disclosed in March 2024.
•  CONTEXT: Round 1 auctions were held under the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) system, but Round 2 was
moved to the Feed-in Premium (FIP), which introduces more of a market price element. The zero-
premium level in Round 2 puts the onus on operators to find their clients directly or via the market,
rather than rely on a fixed rate from the government for the duration of their contract.
•  Next up is Round 3 that will likely cover two project areas: Sea of Japan (South), Aomori Pref (600

MW); and Yuza, Yamagata Pref (450 MW). Round 3 bids are expected to face a deadline of late
June 2024.
• TAKEAWAY: So far, the results look to be free of scandal and have largely been met positively by those in the
industry. That’s already a big step and reflects the much broader range of winners. Round 1, the results of
which were announced at the end of 2021, led to intense scrutiny of the auction rules and process after all
three winning bids went to groups led by trading house Mitsubishi. The outcry that followed delayed further

auction rounds by at least a year as various industry players demanded a revision of the tender system, which
has been tweaked to prevent one company from dominating.
There are several interesting results to examine in Round 2. For one, it’s uncanny that all of the auctions so far

have been won by a group led by a trading house. However, these companies do possess unique qualities that

give them certain advantages at this stage of market development. They are known as good project managers;
retain large staff in Japan and around the world; invest in overseas specialist companies to acquire industry
know-how; and can take on the challenge of building a new supply chain in Japan almost from scratch thanks
to their broad connections. Trading houses also enjoy good credit scores and can attract low-cost financing,
while attracting key suppliers with large contracts.

Among other issues of note is the huge gap between the winning Round 2 bids for the Akita and Niigata
projects, and the Nagasaki projects. One important reason is the type of foundation. Most of the wind farms in
shallow water are monopile constructions, but the Nagasaki offshore site was deemed unsuitable for such
structures as they require heavy duty equipment for installation. Hence, the Nagasaki project had a rate cap

set at ¥29/kWh. And yet, Sumitomo and TEPCO beat rivals thanks to a lower price predicated on a monopile-
type substructure. The cost of jacket-type foundations is 1.9 times higher than for monopile structures.
The appearance of a non-Japanese winner, RWE, as part of the Mitsui-led consortium should give

encouragement to other overseas companies seeking a piece of this market. No doubt, the number of
international firms involved in Japan’s offshore wind sector will only grow over the years, though initial entry
will be tough. As several parties interested in Round 2 discovered, the economics of current projects are still
somewhat uncertain and returns may be below the levels sought by international investors. In part, that’s why
some of the companies that carried out environmental assessments for Round 2 site did not follow through
with a bid. However, as Round 1-2 projects start to get developed, the maturing of the domestic supply chain
and of the logistics infrastructure should give clearer visibility for future developments.

Corporate tax reduction proposed to boost production in five strategic fields
(Mainichi, Dec 12)
o  The govt and ruling party have compiled a new corporate tax reduction system proposal

to promote domestic production in five strategic fields: chips; EVs and FCVs; sustainable
aviation fuel (SAF); green steel; and green chemicals
o  The idea is to reduce corporate taxes for 10 years based on production/ sales volume of
applicable goods. This would strengthen economic security by supporting the production
of strategic materials essential for decarbonization and cutting-edge tech.

•  Itochu plans to provide its expertise in batteries to UON for R&D, and to expand its business scope
in Asia and the U.S.
•  UON, which is partly owned by Macquarie Group, will use the investment to expand its battery
storage business and for R&D, and proposes combining battery storage with renewable energy
sources like solar power for mines and other facilities.
•  CONTEXT: UON specializes in supplying and maintaining "off-grid" power sources for areas with

limited power supply infrastructure, such as mines.




Sumitomo Chemical begins demo production of methanol from CO2
(Company statement, Dec 12)
•  Sumitomo Chemical launched production of methanol from CO2 at a demo plant in Ehime Pref
that will run until 2028.
•  The company and Prof Omata Koji of Shimane University improved the efficiency of converting
CO2 to methanol by utilizing the internal condensation reactor (ICR). It condenses and separates

methanol and water, which was not possible before.
•  Thanks to ICR, yield and energy efficiency improved, and the equipment was downsized. Catalyst
degradation, which happens when a catalyst comes in contact with water, will likely be limited.
•  Sumitomo Chemical plans to commercialize the ICR process and license the technology to third
parties in the 2030s.
•  CONTEXT: Sumitomo Chemical is developing a suite of amine-based carbon capture equipment
for customers ranging from small offices to big industries. With its carbon-to-methanol conversion

processes, the company may be able to offer a turn-key “carbon capture to utilization” solution for
chemical plants.











• TAKEAWAY: Researchers are exploring new methanol production processes since “green” methanol could

have higher market value than green hydrogen or ammonia. Osaka University is developing a methanol
production process using carbon collected from cow manure-derived biogas; Ibaraki University uses carbon
captured from air, to name a few. The key challenges to this technology are the endurance of the methanol
conversion equipment; the ability to make the product at a low cost: and creating an efficient process from
carbon capture to utilization.

Mitsubishi Gas Chemical and Maersk to build base for green methanol fuel in Japan
(Nikkei, Dec 15)
•  Danish group A.P. Moller-Maersk has chosen Yokohama as the site of its first supply base for green

methanol to fuel ships.
•  By the years’ end, the firm plans to sign an MoU with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical and the city of
Yokohama to start supplying methanol.
•  The fuel will be procured by the Danish group from overseas and by MGC from its plant in Niigata
Pref. It will be sold to Maersk and other shipping companies.

•  CONTEXT: Earlier this year, the International Maritime Organization joined global decarbonization
efforts and set a target to make emissions from oceangoing vessels net zero by around 2050.
Maersk began sailing its first ship powered with green methanol in October and plans to launch
such vessels in Asia.




Itochu to cooperate with Hive Hydrogen South Africa for green ammonia production
(Company statement, Dec 11)
•  Itochu signed a MoC with Hive Hydrogen South Africa on the development of a green ammonia
production project. The project aims to produce and market green ammonia using wind and solar

power.
•  CONTEXT: In September, the two countries signed an MoC for collaboration in the fields of
hydrogen and ammonia.
•  CONTEXT: Itochu is also working on projects to manufacture and sell low-carbon ammonia in
Canada, develop ammonia-fueled ships, and use low-carbon ammonia for fertilizer-related
applications.
• TAKEAWAY: This project could supply over 900,000 tons of ammonia to Japan, Korea and Europe each year.

In Sept 2022, Itochu announced a collaboration on ammonia with Sasol, also from South Africa. If these
collaborations develop, South Africa could become a significant source of ammonia for Japan.

KHI to commercialize DAC by 2025, aims for 1 mln tons of annual recovery by 2030

(Denki Shimbun, Dec 13)
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries plans to develop and commercialize Direct Air Capture (DAC)
technology to achieve about ¥50 billion in sales by 2030.
•  In 2025, the company will launch a DAC recovery plant with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons of
CO2. The goal is to build large facilities capable of recovering 500,000 to 1,000,000 tons annually
by 2030.
•  The strategy calls for promoting the business in regions with suitable locations for DAC storage

and abundant renewable energy in order to power those facilities.
•  CONTEXT: KHI President Hashimoto said DAC is an area where the company can use its strengths
and create a big business.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ENEOS installs Swiss-made DAC to produce synthetic fuel

(Company statement, Dec 11)
o  ENEOS began a demo of DAC (Direct Air Capture) at the Central Research Institute of
Technology (Yokohama City). The unit was made by Swiss startup Climeworks.
o  This was the first time in the Asia-Pacific region that the Swiss company's CO2-capturing
equipment was installed.
o  ENEOS seeks to verify whether the recovered CO2 can be used as raw material for
synthetic fuel.
o  CONTEXT: The demo is expected to last more than a year. A DAC unit collects CO2

from the atmosphere using a filter, heating it up to extract the CO2. The amount of CO2
recovered is about 75 kg per day, and the installation area is 7 meters x 7 meters.




KHI clarifies boil-off rates of liquefied hydrogen
(Company statement, Dec 11)
•  The boil-off rate of liquefied hydrogen, or the rate of its evaporation, has been reduced to LNG
levels thanks to new tank technologies, Kawasaki Heavy Industries said, announcing the results of
its research.

•  The first journey of a ship carrying liquified hydrogen was made in 2021; several journeys have
been made since. The boil-off rate was 0.3% per day when the hydrogen was transported from
Australia to Japan on Suiso Frontier, a ship developed by KHI. The rate was 0.06% per day when it
was stored in Kobe in onshore storage tanks, also developed by KHI.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: KHI has developed two-tier stainless steel tanks to transport and store liquefied
hydrogen. The Suiso Frontier has a capacity to load 75 tons of liquefied hydrogen, but it was not
clear how many tons were actually delivered to Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: Based on KHI figures, 75 tons of liquefied hydrogen would reduce to 49 tons after a two-week
sail, and would halve after 25 days. Some experts believed liquefied hydrogen transport, in general, was

unrealistic due to the high boil-off rate. KHI’s clarification will improve the visibility of building international
hydrogen supply chains using liquefaction technologies. See: “How are Less-loved Hydrogen Carriers
Developing?” in the Dec 11 issue of Japan NRG.

•  The move is part of the govt’s plan for decarbonization of ports nationwide.
•  Full-scale operation is scheduled to begin by late 2024.
•  CONTEXT: The proposed CNP certification system is aimed at evaluating decarbonization efforts
within terminals, boundary areas, such as berthing vessels, and trucks, which account for over 90%

of the total emissions from port terminals.

Opinion: Japan’s energy strategy in SE Asia driven by financial interests, not climate
(Dec 12, Nikkei)
•  CONTEXT: This is an opinion piece by Raoul Manuel, a member of the Philippine House of
Representatives and representing the Kabataan Party.
•  Japan's climate aid to ASEAN is more focused on financial interests rather than genuine climate

action. Support for fossil fuel-based technologies like gas expansion, CCUS, and ammonia co-firing
at power plants will not help achieve the global 1.5 C target and it could hinder the shift to
renewable energy in Southeast Asia.
•  ASEAN countries need to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, such as solar and wind. Japan's
strategy emphasizes loans for technologies related to fossil fuel, rather than grants for renewables.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s support for certain technologies isn’t solely based on its manufacturers seeking to export

their equipment. Many countries in Southeast Asia place high importance on oil and gas production, such as
Indonesia and Malaysia. Their emphasis on CCS is a way to protect such industries and their relatively young
fossil fuel fired power plants. However, popular opinion in Southeast Asian countries may shift in time. What’s
more, oil and gas production in the Philippines is relatively minor and has decreased in recent years, which
may change local attitudes to fossil fuels.

Costs for handling Fukushima NPP accident cleanup increased to ¥23.4 trillion

(Nikkei, Dec 15)
•  METI plans to increase the state bonds sale plans by ¥1.9 trillion to cover the increased costs
related to the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident. This raises the current bill for the cleanup to ¥23.4
trillion.
•  The govt has been issuing bonds, capped at ¥13.5 trillion, to lend funds to TEPCO for
compensation and decommissioning work. Due to rising costs, including those for the release of
treated water, the bond limit will be increased to ¥15.4 trillion.
•  This change is partly due to extra compensation for evacuees and fisheries affected by the nuclear

accident, as well as expenses related to interim nuclear waste storage.
•  CONTEXT: After the 9.0 earthquake in 2011 and ensuing tsunami, the wrecked facility has had to
deal with a number of serious issues. One of the most contentious, at least from the public
standpoint, has been the release of water initially used to cool the reactors and then treated to
eliminate most of its radiation. At present radiation levels, the water is safe to be released into the
ocean, according to the IAEA and other scientific bodies. But this has not stopped criticism both at

home and abroad. China’s reaction in particular has caused economic damage to the local fisheries
industry since the neighboring country banned most Japanese seafood imports. In response,
Japan’s government has promised to compensate domestic fishermen and other affected parties
for lost earnings.

o  The samples were collected in an area close to the NPP and several species of fish were
sampled from a market in Fukushima Pref.
o  The IAEA concluded that Japan's sample collection procedures adhere to its standards,

and statistical tests passed with nearly 100% confidence.
o  CONTEXT: The study is part of an ongoing campaign to assist Japan with monitoring the
sea and reporting updates on conditions.

Eneble, encouraged by METI's subsidies, is possibly the first Japanese importer of finished PSC
products on a commercial scale.
•  The company offers PSCs sized 0.72 square meters, either with a power efficiency of 18.06% or
15.28%. One unit costs ¥50,000; orders are for a minimum of 50 units.
•  CONTEXT: The Marubeni offering is very attractive as one-square-meter local AGC-brand glass-

mounted silicon solar modules cost ¥200,000.
• TAKEAWAY: Many businesses are developing interest in PSCs but local manufacturers have not yet started
mass production. Panasonic markets an inkjet printer for PSC production but one machine costs several tens of
millions of yen. The Marubeni solution will possibly expand the scope of PSC product development beyond
the companies in national projects as more businesses will be able to enter this sector.




Construction firm Infroneer to purchase JWD for ¥200 billion

(Company Statement, Dec 12)
•  Infroneer, an infrastructure services company, is set to acquire Japan Wind Development from Bain
Capital for about ¥203 billion.
•  The deal will conclude in late January.
•  CONTEXT: JWD currently operates 293 turbines, total capacity of 570 MW.
• TAKEAWAY: Rumors about the buyout emerged earlier this month amid a bribery scandal involving JWD’s

former management. The firm’s founder and former chief, Tsukawaki Masayuki, was indicted on bribing lower
house lawmaker and ruling LDP member Akimoto Masatoshi. Tsukawaki admitted to the charges. The
company was told by Japanese regulators to perform a legal compliance review, and the deal may help the
company restore public trust. Bain acquired JWD and took it private in 2015. Infroneer was set up in 2021 as a
holding company for construction firm Maeda and subsidiaries.

storage system (BESS). The 500 MW system will use 4-hour BESS capable of storing up to 2 GWh
of electricity.


14



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The project, which is the company’s first in Japan, is estimated to cost ¥91 billion. Local partners
include Nippon Koei Energy Solutions and TMEIC.
•  Construction of the BESS is expected to begin in 2026 and take as long as 6 years. As the site has

not yet been determined, Gurin is set to conduct an assessment for BESS development in either
Fukushima or Tochigi Pref.
•  CONTEXT: Thanks to increases in state subsidies in 2023, more foreign and domestic companies
are now investing in the battery storage industry.
• TAKEAWAY: Gurin’s entry into the Japanese market has come about quite quickly, showing there is strong

interest overseas in the local battery sector. That’s partly due to the high (and growing) level of curtailment
experienced by solar and wind operators nationwide. Investment in new grid infrastructure has lagged that of
renewables capacity. The entry of BESS systems into the market, however, is at an early stage. This means,
battery operators are having to navigate as yet unclear regulatory environments and technical uncertainties. In
Gurin’s case, the company said it plans to set up an office in Tokyo and also launch a training program for
technical and non-technical professionals from local communities.

METI Welcomes New Minister Amid Cabinet Purge

On Dec 14, Saito Ken was named the new METI minister following his predecessor’s
resignation over a financial scandal in the Cabinet. He replaced Nishimura Yasutoshi,
who, alongside other members of the ruling LDP, is accused of underreporting the
party’s income.

Prime Minister Kishida also ousted the economy minister, internal affairs minister,
agriculture minister, as well as Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno. All are members of
the LDP’s largest faction led by the late PM Abe. They allegedly received kickbacks
worth ¥500 million through excess sales of tickets to fundraising events.

The scandal has plunged already limp ratings for PM Kishida’s government to
worrying levels. His personal support rate dropped to 17% in a Jiji poll as similar
allegations were made around other LDP factions. Kishida has already purged more
than a dozen Abe faction members from top posts within the government and party.

Despite the political maelstrom, incoming METI minister Saito is expected to be a
steady hand on the tiller. While this is his first ministerial position at METI, the ministry
is actually where Saito began to build his government service career in the early
1980s.


He’s already hit the ground running, attending the key ASEAN-Japan Economic Co-
Creation Forum on Saturday, Dec. 16, on top of the Japan-Thai Investment Forum the
previous day. In meetings with the leaders of Vietnam, Thailand and Brunei, Saito has
echoed the current government’s focus on an energy transition that aligns with
regional interests.

New minister’s ‘To Do’ list
One of the first challenges that Saito will face is to promote understanding among
neighbors that are skeptical of Japan’s decision to discharge treated water from
TEPCO’s beleaguered Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. During a news conference
following his appointment, Saito vowed to "support the people of Fukushima”.

“I feel a great sense of responsibility,” he said. "There is no problem with the safety of
the treated water, but from the standpoint of security, it cannot be said that there are
no problems, including China's stance. We will make every effort to explain the
situation and gain their understanding.”

Saito will also have to grapple with Japan’s effort to meet ambitious goals to decrease
fossil fuels use and reduce GHG emissions by 46% in FY2030 over FY2013 levels. As
part of those efforts, next summer he’ll oversee amendments to the Basic Energy Plan,
which is revised every 3 years.

Earlier this year, the government issued its so-called “Green Transformation (GX) Basic
Policy,” which is a roadmap for Japan’s decarbonization. Next year, the focus will be

20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

on GX fundraising as the government starts marketing the so-called GX Economic
Transition Bonds, the first part of a ¥20-trillion, 10-year bond issuance program to
raise capital for net-zero. The rest of the ¥150-trillion GX investment program is
expected to come mostly from private capital.

The current Basic Energy Plan sets the 2030 goal of generating 36-38% of Japan’s
electricity from renewable sources, which would be a jump from the 21.7% that the
sector registered in FY2022. The push to renewables calls for halving power
generation from fossil fuels; while nuclear energy is expected to make up 20-22% of
the mix in 2030, with hydrogen comprising the remaining 1%.

Saito’s background
The 64-year-old Tokyo native who studied at Harvard University has significant
experience in the energy sector. In 1983, he joined the then Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (METI’s predecessor) and was involved in energy policy until March
2006, covering both the gas and electric utilities sector.

He also can tap into expertise gained during his tenure as agriculture minister from
August 2017 until October 2018. Biofuels is one area where energy and agriculture
policies overlap. Saito’s most recent government post was as Minister of Justice (Nov
2022 to Sept 2023).

Saito’s tenure as head of METI starts just as Japan is seeing a historic move towards
scaling up renewables. On the day of his appointment, in a highly anticipated
decision, METI and MLIT chose three consortiums to develop three separate large-
scale offshore wind farms.


His role, however, will also include taking charge of policies related to the use of other
energy sources such as nuclear and hydrogen. Nishimura’s predecessor, Hagiuda,
openly spoke about how “indispensable” nuclear power is for decarbonization. Under
Kishida, he pushed for restarting nuclear reactors.

Hagiuda also pledged "swift measures" to address shortcomings in existing power
grids to speed up the introduction of renewables. Nishimura, meanwhile, gave a
greater accent to the introduction of startups to Japan’s energy sector and supported
a wider adoption of EVs.

Significantly, Saito was a member of the LDP’s Ishiba faction, which was formed by
Ishiba Shigeru – a key rival to Abe and a vocal critic of his administration. After Ishiba’s
failure to secure party leadership, his faction was reorganized into a looser grouping.
Still, Ishiba remains a popular lawmaker and one of the few willing to openly challenge
the LDP leaders. He’s recently called on PM Kishida to step down due to the funding
scandal.

For all the changes in government and political uncertainties, the policy course at
METI is unlikely to see any major changes. One ministry official, speaking after the
appointment, said they expected little change in energy policy with Saito’s arrival.
Instead, Saito’s international negotiation experience and awareness of issues in the
energy sector should ensure a smooth transition, they said.

COLUMN:       ENERGY      JOBS   IN  JAPAN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Jinji Ido, the Generalist Approach
To generalize or to specialize? This is one of the age old questions of career planning
and personnel development, with strong advocates on both sides. Where does Japan
tend to lean? Here, the generalist approach is typically favored, and there is a
Japanese expression ‘Jinji Ido’ (personnel reshuffling) that’s common practice,
especially in larger firms.


Jinji Ido is the practice of rotating positions, usually from as short as two, to as long as
five years. These can be quite drastic, for example shifting from frontline sales into
human resource management, then into product management and so on. They can
also include sudden moves to different cities, countries or rotations into subsidiary or
joint-venture companies. Often, the employee has little say in the direction of their
next rotation, and is not aware of what the upcoming move will be until a couple of
months or even weeks before their new assignment. On top of this, the rotation
schedule follows the HR department workflow rather than project schedules, hence
rotations happen en masse at one time in the year, which leads to personnel changes
across key positions in projects.

The logic behind this practice is deeply rooted in Japanese corporate and
employment culture and linked to the practice of lifetime employment. By having
employees become exposed to different functions and sections within the company,
they can better understand each moving piece, communicate cross-functionally. And
when moved up into leadership roles, have a more rounded view of the business and
respect for differences.

For prospective employers looking to hire Japanese talent, this system naturally
presents both advantages and disadvantages. Below, I’ll share a few of both, as well
as some tips on what to look for when hiring a generalized Japanese professional.

Advantages:
Broad skill sets: This system tends to create well-rounded professionals who can
understand and cover multiple key areas of business, and also communicate more
effectively with members of other departments.

Proven adaptability: Due to the sudden and often unpredictable nature of these
rotations, as well as the expectation to slot into a position that was just occupied by
someone who knew what they were doing, Japanese professionals tend to learn and
adapt quickly to new situations.

Project management and flexible leadership: As opposed to specialists who have
worked their way up the corporate ladder, the well rotated Japanese leader will find
themselves in a position where they can manage a department or organization that
consists of diverse functions, personalities and needs. This has advantages both in
project management and leading complex organizations.

Disadvantages:
Lack of real expertise: If mastery takes 10,000 hours, then this system certainly stops
mastery in its tracks! For roles requiring a high level of expertise, often in the
engineering area for example, this generalization is a clear detriment to finding the
levels found in other markets.

Lower value roles: Some positions, such as those connected to corporate strategy,
business planning etc, are ideal for those who will remain in the company forever
since they are exposed to the inner workings of the organization, and develop
important political connections. On the flipside, these roles take people away from
the frontline of the business, therefore time in such roles is of little value outside of
that particular organization. On top of this, Japanese companies fire low performers
much less than Western firms. Rather, they tend to shuffle people into sideline
positions where they have a nice title, are kept busy but don’t lead anything of real
consequence.

Lack of ownership over one’s career: A generalization to be sure, however someone
who accepts every rotation without taking control of their own career direction,
without pushing for a role they want internally, or putting themselves on the market,
will likely lack the direction, ownership and ambition that many prospective employers
are looking for.

Well rounded stud or glorified paper pusher?
At its best, Jinji Ido will provide you with a fast-tracked, well-rounded, adaptable
superstar. At its worst, the result will be years of various busy work without any real
depth of expertise or track record of complete projects. How do you separate the
wheat from the chaff?

Look for upward progression: Though this is more difficult than if the professional in
question had stayed in a single function, career progression is detectable. Look for
overseas transfers, roles in charge of key projects, exposure to team leadership early
in the career, or a shift to corporate strategy / President’s office around mid 30s.
These are all signs that the firm sees potential in the employee and are continuing to
invest.


Core career theme or all over the place: A future business leader may have a core
theme of commercial management with rotations into business development,
financing, project management but coming back into larger, more complex
commercial roles. This pattern of building complementary skill sets and increasing
project complexity and size shows a winner on the way up. On the other hand, as
Japanese companies find it hard to fire people, they will shuffle low performers
around low impact, often highly unrelated positions. These positions will not allow for
skill stacking or scaling up into bigger projects.

Return to the mothership or one way ticket to the outer territories: Rotations to
subsidiary or joint-venture companies are not uncommon. When the move is into a
position of authority, and that person is rotated back into the parent company in a few
years, you know there is potential. A sideways move into a subsidiary on the other
hand is in reality a move down. Likewise, not rotating back into the parent company,
or gaining fast promotion in the subsidiary can be a red flag.

Case study #1 - The turn-around leader
A couple of years ago, we were retained by a global OEM in the renewable energy
space to replace their General Manager. The previous two GMs had come from a pure
sales background, very numbers driven, clear, ambitious and did well on the sales
side. This firm, however, was only about 25% sales professionals, the other 75%
consisting of service, logistics, engineering and others. These functions were
chronically underperforming, had high staff turnover and low morale, leading to poor
project implementation and client dissatisfaction, which hurt the bottom line.

APAC leadership recognised this and tasked us with finding a well-balanced leader
who could bring the company together as a team. The gentleman who we identified
and secured had worked with two large Japanese firms, had a core background in
sales and new business development. However, he had a stint in production, as well
as service and order fulfillment. He had also been expatriated overseas for a few
years, allowing him to communicate with clarity and authority back to regional and HQ
stakeholders.

In his first year in office, topline grew for the first time in years, employee turnover
slowed 80%, and employee satisfaction surveys increased dramatically.

Case study #2 - Offshore wind engineers
Round 2 offshore wind results have just dropped. As expected, after the revision of
the rules, there are a number of winners. That means multiple companies will need
people to execute on these projects. We often field requests for fully bilingual
structural engineers with 10+ years of experience in the offshore wind industry, or
project controllers with 10+ years of experience in cost and schedule management for
increasingly complex offshore projects. Unfortunately, these rare beasts do not yet
exist in the nascent Japanese market.

The question then is, do you expatriate or hire global talent who can move into the
role quickly, or hire the young, high-potential Japanese generalist and invest in their
development? That is a topic for another article. However, considering that just about
every developer, OEM and EPC in the market are stretched already, I feel you may
guess which way I lean on this topic ;)

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This new weekly column will replace Global View and will focus on energy events in Asia and those that
directly impact markets in the region.

Australia / Solar power
EDF Australia will invest €10 million in Vast Renewables, a developer of concentrated
solar power (CSP) systems. This includes the Vast Solar 1 project in South Australia
that will comprise 30 MW of CSP with 288 MWh of thermal storage. The project will
be co-located with the planned Solar Methanol 1, the world’s first green methanol
demo plant.

China / Power system
China is changing its power system to reduce payments to solar providers while
making energy storage more profitable. At least 20 of China’s 35 provinces and
regions have adopted electricity rate plans that reduce prices in the middle of the day
and raise them in peak morning and evening hours.

China / Solar power
The cost of producing solar modules in China has dropped by 42% in the last 12
months to $0.15/ watt. This gives Chinese manufacturers an enormous cost advantage
over international rivals, according to Wood Mackenzie.

India / Coal
Strong demand for coal is driving up the shares of mining companies. Coal India is up
55%, and power generator NTPC, which produces mostly coal-fired power, has
surged 78%.

India / Oil
The average price of Russian oil sold to India in October rose to $84.20 per barrel, far
above the $60 price cap set by the G7 in December 2022, according to Indian
government data.

Kazakhstan / Wind power
TotalEnergies agreed with Kazakhstan to invest about $1.4 billion for onshore wind
projects. TotalEnergies said its Mirny project will be composed of 160 turbines along
with a 600 MWh of battery energy storage.

Panama Canal / Energy transit
A severe drought will impact trade flows and push up freight costs. U.S. diesel is
increasingly heading to Europe as South America buys less due to Panama Canal
logjams. Chile, for example, will instead likely pull gasoline from Asia.

Singapore / Energy transition
Tuas Power, the country’s leading power and utility firm and sole operator of a
coal/biomass cogeneration plant, will rely on the use of more biomass and renewable
energy imports for decarbonisation. Tuas accounts for over 20% of Singapore’s
energy supply.

Singapore / Solar power
JTC awarded Sembcorp Solar Singapore the tender for a solar farm that will cover 60
hectares. It will have a capacity of 117 MW, increasing the total solar generation
capacity of Jurong Island from 25 MW to 142 MW.

Vietnam / CRMs
China and Vietnam agreed to boost cooperation on security matters as President Xi
visited the country. He also urged broader cooperation on critical rare minerals.
Vietnam has the world's second largest deposits of rare earths after China, which
dominates the supply of CRMs.
