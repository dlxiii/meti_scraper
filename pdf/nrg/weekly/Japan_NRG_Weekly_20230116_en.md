global energy security, strengthening of cooperation in clean energy, and the importance of the
energy transition. Other topics included energy efficiency, nuclear, geothermal, and hydrogen and
ammonia.
•  Nuclear energy featured high in the joint statement as the two sides agreed to work jointly on
next-generation reactor technology, including SMRs, to be utilized in both counties. The U.S. and

Japan also agreed to seek opportunities for next-gen reactor construction in third countries.
•  The two parties reaffirmed the importance of renewable energy development under the Japan-
U.S. Clean Energy and Energy Security Initiative (CEESI) established in May 2022. The two
countries plan technical meetings on adaptable power grid systems and joint workshops on
offshore wind and geothermal technologies.
•  CONTEXT: The statement echoes METI’s recent moves to push next-gen nuclear tech. Also, from

April 2023, state energy company JOGMEC will be involved in geothermal, CCUS, hydrogen and
other clean energy projects overseas.
• TAKEAWAY: Energy cooperation between the two countries encompasses many sectors but it is LNG and
nuclear that seem to have the most traction of late. The prominent discussion of joint efforts in the nuclear
power field in particular augurs some near-term developments, possibly with U.S. reactor vendors winning
contracts domestically and / or abroad and Japanese firms involved as component suppliers.




Japan delays ALPS treated water discharge from spring to summer of 2023
(Yomiuri Shimbun, Jan. 13)
•  Japan confirmed that the release of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP into the ocean
will be delayed from spring to summer of 2023.
•  In April 2021, the government decided on a plan for TEPCO to release the treated water into the

ocean after diluting it to reduce the concentration of tritium well below the percentage permitted
by national regulations.
•  The equipment to release the treated water will be ready in June 2023, so the release is expected
to start in July 2023.

• TAKEAWAY: More than 1.32 million tons of treated water is stored in over 1,000 units of large tanks at the
Fukushima NPP. On Dec 23, TEPCO stated the criteria of indemnification for the local fishing community for
reputational damage due to the planned treated water discharge.

Fallout from China blocking visas for Japanese citizens
(Japan NRG, Jan. 10)
•  China suspended issuance of visas to Japanese and South Korean nationals in retaliation for
COVID restrictions introduced in the two countries.
•  Many businesses were planning to resume travels to China this quarter, to conduct on-site checks
and other activities suspended due to China’s COVID control policy. The visa block will slow efforts

to recover crippled supply chains.
•  Rare earth and other raw material traders say that Chinese restrictions have been limited to visas,
and customs clearance of Chinese exports to Japan remains normal.
• TAKEAWAY: Generally, Japanese businesses are not expecting the spat to extend beyond visa restrictions.
Their underlying concerns are the pandemic’s impact on the Chinese economy.



Indonesia reaffirms copper concentrate export ban this year
(Jakarta Globe, Jan. 10)
•  The Indonesian president plans to ban the export of copper concentrate in mid 2023 following a

Japan Unveils Energy Transition Roadmap
But Nuclear Shift Grabs the Headlines

At the end of 2022, Japan published the draft of a new national decarbonization
strategy. The Basic Policy to Implement a Green Transformation (GX) will, in effect,
become Japan’s top energy and climate roadmap.

While the document covers the costs, volumes and timelines for 22 industrial sectors,
it is item No. 16 that drew almost all the attention: the plan to build new nuclear
reactors in Japan. This marks a major reversal of government policy over a decade
since the Fukushima accident after which even discussing it was political taboo.

To be sure, the word “nuclear” is almost entirely absent from the slide dedicated to
the change. Instead, the GX roadmap refers to “innovative next-generation reactors”,
tacitly acknowledging the size of the state policy leap in the last 12 months.

Laying Fukushima’s ghosts to rest is only a part of the strategy, and one that officials
say has become overblown in the media. Potentially more significant is the clear
support for carbon pricing, a detailed commitment to carbon capture and storage,
and the emphasis placed on hydrogen and battery sectors.

For all the industrial, financing and technical details crammed into the strategy, Prime
Minister Kishida’s Cabinet faces a tricky task, that of convincing the broader public
that GX is not just about bringing Japan’s dormant nuclear power units back online.


GX status
The Basic Policy to Implement a Green Transformation (GX) was published on Dec 22
after five meetings of the GX Implementation Council, an entity personally led by
Kishida to drive change in the country’s energy strategy.

The draft document was opened to public comments for one month starting Dec 23.
A final version is due to be approved by the Cabinet next month, after which it is
expected to play a central role in promoting the shift to a low-carbon future.

The roadmap covers three periods: the short term (until 2025), the mid-term (until
2030), and the long-term (until 2040 and 2050). It offers a glimpse of how Japan’s
officials see the development of the renewables sector, what decarbonization steps
are planned for the steel, chemicals, maritime and air transport and other areas, and
why investment in carbon recycling for synthetic fuels and power grids are important.

Here are a few points of interest:
•  ¥20 trillion in investments from the public and private sector are slated for solar, wind,
geothermal, hydro and bio energy over the next 10 years

•  ¥11 trillion to be spent on upgrading the grid to help accommodate a bigger share of
renewables; This includes building energy storage facilities and power lines to connect the
northern isle of Hokkaido with mainland Honshu

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  ¥7 trillion or more to go into the hydrogen and ammonia sectors over the next 10 years, both
in public and private money, so as to secure 3 million tons of hydrogen equivalent by 2030; By
2050, Japan wants hydrogen supply to hit 20 million tons and ammonia 30 million tons

•  ¥34 trillion or more of public and private investment over the next 10 years to support the
auto industry’s net-zero shift; From ~2035, new car sales are EVs or run on other non-fossil
fuels

•  ¥5 trillion of investments to support aviation’s shift to carbon neutrality and ¥3 trillion for the
marine industry to do the same by developing vessels that run on SAF or ammonia


Nuclear’s return to favor
The most dramatic narrative, however, belongs to nuclear power, which wasn’t visible
in the early stages of the GX program. Before the war in Ukraine set off a chain of
global energy crises, no senior figures in the Japanese government ever suggested
more than a gradual and cautious restart of existing nuclear reactors.

The March 2011 catastrophe at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP shutdown most nuclear
facilities and equally scared a number of European countries, such as Germany and
the Netherlands, into announcing plans to close their plants.

As recently as the start of 2022, doubt, indecision and ambiguity persisted among
lawmakers on the issue of nuclear energy, despite a growing sense that reactors may
need to play a prominent role in any future net-zero scenario.

Last year’s concerns about energy supplies, especially of LNG imports, changed
things. With Europe desperate to secure quick alternatives to Russian pipeline gas,
LNG prices jumped to historic highs and available volumes dried up. PM Kishida
realized that the only way to de-escalate intense bidding over finite LNG supply in the
short term was to restart more reactors and fall back on coal. It helped that a wave of
international support for a nuclear revival swept the globe.

METI saw a chance to persuade the public to reverse their anti-nuclear sentiment,
carefully steering government discussions to that end. But it still needed a vehicle.

On taking over as prime minister in October 2021, Kishida inherited his predecessor’s
energy strategy. Seeking to make his own mark, he started to promote the term GX,
mirroring the DX (digital transformation) initiative that was started by his predecessor,
Suga Yoshihide. A new government body, the GX Implementation Council, was set up
with Kishida at the helm.

The Council held its first session on July 27, 2022, setting out its goal to enact policy
to accelerate the clean energy transition. Kishida noted that Japan won't be able to
achieve its GX goals without finding solutions to the current energy crisis. For that,
Kishida called on using policies to support additional reactor restarts and retaining
nuclear power as one of the tools to help meet GX goals.

Two days later, METI’s Innovative Reactor Working Group issued a roadmap for
innovative reactors with highly improved safety, suggesting for the first time in over a
decade that Japan would consider building new nuclear facilities.

The Group’s outlook included more innovative nuclear reactor tech gaining traction
overseas, such as SMRs, but noted that in the most immediate future Japan should
build reactors based on the BWR and PWR technologies it has employed for decades,
albeit with improved designs. Using familiar reactor tech should allow for new
construction at the start of the 2030s, with operations slated for the latter part of the
decade.

Two steps forward, one step back
Today, it seems as if the return to nuclear energy was linear and swift. But even after
METI’s working group floated the idea of building new reactors, the ministry’s official
position of gradual restarts but no new construction didn’t change. In fact, on Aug 2,
then METI Minister Hagiuda reiterated that “the government has no intention to
replace or build new NPPs.”

The struggle within government and bureaucracy intensified. On Aug 4, the
Federation of LDP Members for Promoting Replacement of Nuclear Reactors held an
emergency meeting of the Diet’s general assembly. A resolution was passed to
promote building new reactors on the site of old units that need replacing. The
group’s chair, Tomomi Inada, asked to use the word “replacement” to describe new
construction and to include this in the GX program.

This was the turning point. During the second session of the GX Council on Aug 24,
the issue of developing and building next-gen reactors as replacements for aging
units came up. The Council also advocated to extend the operational period of
existing, idled units.

Extending the lifetime of existing reactors can help operators recoup investments. But
it could also delay the construction of new units. Seeing the contradiction, the industry
quickly lobbied to keep extensions minimal, covering only the amount of years the
facilities were idle after the Fukushima accident.

For the next two GX Council sessions, on Oct 26 and Nov 29, the main agenda
focused on carbon pricing, emissions trading, low carbon measures for industries
(steel, chemical, cement, vehicles, etc) and finance. Nuclear policy barely featured.

Finally, at the Council’s fifth session on Dec 22, METI issued a draft for the Basic Policy
to Implement a Green Transformation (GX). As per the July working group’s
suggestions, it calls for support of a number of next-gen reactors, but the immediate
focus is on the improved versions of existing technologies in use in Japan.

Over the coming months, METI is ready to support the restart of reactors already
approved by the NRA but waiting on the green light from local governments (units 1
and 2 of Takahama NPP; unit 2 of Onagawa NPP; unit 2 of Shimane NPP; Kashiwazaki
Kariwa NPP and Tokai No. 2 NPP). Also, METI wants to see reactors that are still under
NRA review progress to the next stage.

With new sites for NPPs highly unlikely, the main result of the GX strategy for nuclear
power will be the replacement of decommissioned reactors with next-generation
reactors. Until those new units are built and operational, current facilities will need to
restart and cover electricity demand.

MOE Sets Up New Green Investment Fund
With Eye on Regional Decarbonization Projects


Two years ago, METI set up a ¥2-trillion Green Innovation Fund (GIF) to support early-
stage R&D to help Japan meet its 2050 net-zero ambitions. Now, that effort is getting a
further boost with a new fund that will pool cash from the private sector with state support
and direct them to regional projects.
In late 2022, the Ministry of the Environment (MoE) created its own green fund. Though
much smaller than GIF, the Japan Green Investment Corp for Carbon Neutrality (JICN) will
play an important though different role within the government’s net-zero strategy.

The focus on local activities is noteworthy. Most of GIF’s funds go to large companies,
the bulk of which are headquartered in Tokyo. JICN’s activities will support local
initiatives, empowering municipalities all over the country to find and fund carbon
neutral projects. The fund’s work should dovetail with the MoE’s 100 Areas that Lead
in Decarbonization, a kind of nationwide clean cities program.

The overall scope of JICN won’t just be limited to regional projects. Unlike METI’s
focus on early-stage research, JICN will also support technologies that are close to
reaching commercial reality. This will have tangible implications for the rollout of EV
charging networks, the cleaning of supply chains and other decarbonization pathways.


Key facts
Launched in October 2022 as a public-private fund, JICN will invest and provide loans
for projects that help achieve net-zero carbon emissions targets by 2050. The fund will
be active until the end of FY2050.

JICN has a founding capital of ¥20.4 billion, half of which was invested by 82 private
companies and banks, with the rest coming from the Ministry of Finance’s Fiscal
Investment and Loan Program (FILP).


The government could add another ¥9.8 billion to the fund by April and the MoE is
requesting a further ¥40 billion from the FILP for the next fiscal year. It also wants ¥20
billion in five-year government guarantees so that JICN can raise funds in public
markets.

Below is a breakdown of the 82 private sector investors. JICN’s founders are the
Development Bank of Japan, Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, and
MUFG Bank.

Organizational structure
The fund was set up following revisions to the Act on Promotion of Global Warming
(地球温暖化対策推進法)  that took effect in July 2022 and started operations on Oct
28. At the inaugural meeting, Environment Minister Nishimura said he wants the fund

to lead in implementing the national policy to attract ¥150 trillion of public and private
investments into decarbonization efforts over the next 10 years.

Minister Nishimura’s remarks coincide with the government’s push for the “green
transformation” (GX) of Japan’s economic, social and industrial structures. The ¥150-
trillion figure is the umbrella for an array of programs and initiatives that the
government wants to promote to wean Japan off fossil fuels.

The president and CEO of JICN is Tayoshi Yoshihiko, a former bank official who
served as a member of the board for the MoE-controlled Green Finance Organization.
JICN has taken over many of the functions performed by the Green Finance
Organization, which was founded in 2013 by the MoE to fund regional low-carbon
society projects.

Still, JICN is much more than a name upgrade. Nearly a decade in operation, its
predecessor invested only ¥18.4 billion in 37 projects, mostly in wind and biomass
power generation. The remit of JICN, however, is much broader than renewable
energy. Below are some of the sectors that will fall within its scope.

1. Reduction of CO2 from energy sources
•  Power and heat supply
o  Renewable electricity (i.e., solar, wind, small hydro, biomass, geothermal)
o  Renewable heat
o  Co-firing of biomass and ammonia at thermal power plants
o  Production and sale of biomass fuels

•  Residential
o  Zero Energy Houses (ZEH)
o  Energy saving, solar panels, storage batteries
•  Agriculture/Food
o  Solar-sharing
o  Energy saving freezers containing no chlorofluorocarbon
•  Transportation

o  EV and charging/ discharging devices combined with renewable energy
o  Decarbonized vessels
o  Carbon neutral ports and airports
•  Supply Chains
o  Decarbonization-related products, services, the manufacturing and sale of material and
parts

o  Renewable energy supply, energy storage facility for hydrogen and others
o  Microgrids and other distribution businesses to maximize the use of renewables
•  Office/ commercial buildings
o  Zero Energy Buildings
o  Installations of equipment to use onsite solar power (i.e., carports)
o  Energy efficiency improvement
o  Decarbonization of factories (i.e., electrification, equipment upgrades)


2. Reduction of CO2 from non-energy sources
•  Recycling of plastic, development of alternative materials
•  Upgrade of manufacturing processes for cement and other industries
•  Shift to biogas (methane fermentation) when upgrading waste incineration plants
•  Reduction of methane emissions from farming

3. Increasing GHG sinks
•  Revitalization of the forestry industry, cultivation of fuels on abandoned farmland, development of
green infrastructure


4. Investment in companies that provide finance to businesses above

New Fund’s Scope of Support












Source: JICN
The fund will target projects in the later stages of development, that have completed
a feasibility study and began design and site inspections; or those that have advanced
to the procurement, construction, and operation stage. Also, it's looking into how to
support startups and other types of organizations.

Decisions on investment will be made by the fund’s Decarbonization Committee. The
role of JICN is not limited to equity financing. Also, it can offer mezzanine financing
and debt guarantees. While JICN will set out more detailed definitions and
requirements for its investment targets, it says projects eligible for support need to
address three key aspects:

1) Policy: the project must contribute to creating a decarbonized society through
action that cuts emissions and increases carbon sinks;
2) Profitability: the project needs to prove that investment can be recouped;
3) Management: the project must be led by an ambitious operator(s) with plans to
expand the business model further and build on it.


Another green finance tool
JICN is one of several government green financing vehicles, all of which sit within the
national GX strategy. The best-known include METI’s GIF, as well as recent plans by
the government to issue ¥20 trillion in bonds under a new category that it calls “GX
economy transition bonds”.

Still, the cadre of firms already signed up for JICN suggests that the fund will be more
than just another state vehicle. Its role is to enact the national decarbonization agenda
at a local level by disseminating know-how about green finance in the regions. In turn,
that should accelerate more net-zero projects nationwide, benefiting both local
governments and businesses with a regional presence.


JICN and the MoE’s “100 Areas that Lead in Decarbonization” program can act as a
“twin-turbo engine” to steer decarbonization investments toward regional
development, says a former senior MoE official, adding that local knowledge of
energy transition financing could improve with experience.

While Kishida’s GX strategy has dominated headlines in recent months, it will come
down to smaller programs such as JICN that will make sure the GX vision becomes
reality.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ Crude demand
Crude import quotas were boosted as the world's largest crude importer prepares to
meet higher domestic demand. As of this week, China issued a combined 132 MMT
of quotas for crude imports in 2023, compared to 109 MMT at the same time last
year.

Finland/ Offshore wind
Sweden's Vattenfall set up a joint venture with state-owned Metsahallitus to build the
country's first large offshore wind farm. The €3 billion project will have a capacity of
1.3 GW.

Germany/ Offshore wind
Siemens Energy and Spain's Dragados Offshore won a €4 billion contract to build two
converter systems for offshore wind energy grid connections. This will be Siemens
Energy’ largest offshore grid connection order to date.

German/ Solar power
Photovoltaic leasing firm Enpal is close to securing €215 million in equity, seeking to
expand and meet increasing demand for residential solar power. The new financing
brings the firm’s valuation to about €2.2 billion.

Italy/ Natural gas
Energy group Eni and gas grid operator Snam inked a €405 million deal under which
Snam acquired a stake in Eni's assets in various companies managing the gas
networks between North Africa and Italy.

Solar Power
Growth in the U.S. solar industry will slow in 2023, but EU and Asian markets are
poised for growth, SolarEdge’s CFO Ronen Faier told investors at a Goldman Sachs
conference. He cited high prices and regulatory uncertainties in the U.S. as factors.

Sweden/ Rare earth metals
State-owned mining company LKAB said it discovered Europe’s largest deposit of rare
earth metals needed for the energy transition. However, it could take 10 years before
the raw materials are delivered to market.

UAE/ Decarbonization
ADNOC will allocate $15 billion by 2030 aiming to reduce its carbon intensity by 25%
and grow its carbon capture capacity to 5 million tons. Investments will be made in
clean power, CCS and electrification.

UK/ Wind power
In 2022, wind farms accounted for a record 26.8% of the nation’s electricity, up from
21.8% in 2021. But gas-fired power plants remained the leading power source,
according to National Grid data.

U.S/ Pollution control
New York State will set an annual pollution cap on industry, aiming to lower emissions
and generate $1 billion a year. Major emitters will purchase permits when selling
polluting fuels. The proceeds will cover utility bills, transportation costs, and
decarbonization programs.
