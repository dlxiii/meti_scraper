NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





METI to focus on GX cost cuts, support for hard-to-abate sectors in next Basic Energy Plan

(Government statement, Sept 12)
•  On Sept 12, METI’s subcommittee on energy policy agreed that the next Basic Energy Plan to be
released by the end of FY2024 should ensure continuity with existing policies such as the GX
Promotion Strategy.
•  The subcommittee also stressed the importance of minimizing the overall social costs associated
with decarbonization initiatives, taking into account that these costs may ultimately be borne by
taxpayers, as well as the need to reflect industry voices.

•  On next-gen fuels, CCUS and critical minerals, ANRE said the policy should be formulated with an
understanding of current costs and future installation estimates.
•  The other points included:
o  Boosting state support for hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, chemical, transportation
and power generation;
o  Promoting recycling to secure critical minerals due to Japan’s dependency on primary
supply from certain countries;

o  Ensuring energy resilience in light of the country's frequent natural disasters.
•  Regarding the increase in electricity demand due to digital transformation, (DX), committee
members also called for an integrated development of data centers and electric power facilities;
and some requested more weight to be given to promoting energy conservation and energy-
saving tech.
•  CONTEXT: Since May 2024, the Basic Policy Subcommittee has been conducting various studies in

preparation for the next Basic Energy Plan. This is in response to discussions at the GX
Implementation Council, the joint meeting of the Industrial Structure Council and the Central
Environment Council, and other related councils, as well as the situation in Japan and abroad.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI seeks to boost support for fuel cell demand, infrastructure

(Government statement, Sept 12)
•  METI will boost support for hydrogen fuel cell track and bus sales by identifying prefectures that
show the most interest in promoting this type of mobility.
•  The subsidies will come in a kind of contract-for-difference format, through which the state will
cover three-quarters of the difference in cost between using existing fossil fuels and those fuels
based on ‘low-carbon’ hydrogen.
•  CONTEXT: Japan has only around 8,500 hydrogen fuel cell (FC) vehicles and 163 stations where

they can refuel. Part of METI’s FC mobility support will be to simplify and standardize FC refueling
station regulations.
•  METI selection criteria for offering FC mobility subsidies will be based on the current efforts of
regions. Ministry officials will look at the mileage and number of registered FC vehicles in each
prefecture and the status of local government efforts to establish sales targets. The selection of
eligible regions will start this winter and a final subsidy decision will be made by March 2025.

• TAKEAWAY: Current government FC mobility efforts focus on commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses,
rather than passenger cars. Among the sectors most interested in FC vehicles are public transport and
shipping operators. In the future, METI wants to set conversion targets for companies to switch diesel trucks of
8 tons and more to clean-burning fuels like hydrogen FC. The biggest bottlenecks for businesses are the cost
of FC vehicles and a lack of access to refueling stations. That’s why METI wants to concentrate support for FC
vehicle adoption in a few areas so that resources can tap into the network effect.

•  The cells are named “4680” after their size: 46 mm in diameter and 80 mm high. They can store

five times as much energy as standard Panasonic 2170 cells.
•  The new cells require fewer parts than the 21 mm cells and have higher capacity than conventional
cells; this allows automakers to reduce the number of cells in each car, thus lowering cost while
improving efficiency.
•  Panasonic plans to double domestic cell production, adding 22.5 GWh by 2030 as it seeks
partnerships with other car makers.

•  CONTEXT: With Subaru, Panasonic also plans a new battery plant in Gunma Pref. Another
partnership is planned with Mazda. Panasonic will produce and supply cylindrical Li-ion batteries
starting FY2027. By 2030, it aims for domestic production capacity of 10 GWh/ year with Mazda,
and 16 GWh with Subaru.
•  CONTEXT: Growth in EV battery production has been slowing – in January to July 2024, about 8.5
million EVs were made globally, which is 21% YoY growth; however, this is down from 40% growth

in the same period in 2023.
• TAKEAWAY: Batteries are the biggest cost driver for original equipment manufacturers, pushing manufacturers
to advance battery cell tech. Li-ion batteries will remain mainstream in the near future, even though some
companies are experimenting with innovations. Japan’s recent bid to strengthen financial support for storage
batteries reflects growing opportunities for new, more efficient energy storage tech in Japan despite slowing
EV sales.

o  Between 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m., TEPCO Power Grid received up to 300 MW of extra
power from Chubu Electric.
o  Between 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., Tohoku Electric received up to 450 MW of extra power

from four firms — TEPCO Power Grid, KEPCO, Hokkaido Electric and Hokuriku Electric.
•  That day in the evening JERA, the largest utility with thermal power plants in the Tokyo
metropolitan and Chubu areas, raised power output at eight of its units to cope with the tight
supply and demand situation.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
KEPCO receives extra power supply from Chubu Electric

(Organization statement, Sept 12)
o  Between 5:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on Sept 12, due to tight power reserves amid higher
than expected temperatures in the area, KEPCO’s subsidiary Kansai Transmission and
Distribution received up to 420 MW of additional power from Chubu Electric.



Spot trading volume rose in August as West Japan faces record heat
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 11)
•  JEPX recorded a 2.9% MoM increase in spot market trading volume for August, reaching a daily

average of 785 GWh, the fourth consecutive month of growth.
•  West Japan experienced record-breaking heat, pushing wholesale market prices up and widening
the price gap with East Japan. On Aug 30, prices hit a yearly high of ¥45/ kWh due to the impact
of a strong typhoon on power supply.
•  The August total volume rose to 24.3 TWh, with spot trading accounting for 29.3% of total power
demand.
•  System prices climbed across most categories, with the 24-hour average price reaching ¥14.48, up

¥0.33 MoM.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan Fair Trade Commission seeks feedback on power trade guidelines
(Government statement, Sept 12)
o  The Japan Fair Trade Commission seeks feedback on its proposed revision of guidelines
for retail power trading.

o  This seeks to clarify that leading regional power companies (EPCOs), which ask retailers
not to resell the power sold, would be violating the Antimonopoly Act.
o  The feedback period ends Oct 11.
o  CONTEXT: A retailer (or trader / broker) can buy electricity from an EPCO and then resell
it to another party. The EPCOs, however, often do not want their buyers to do so, seeing
resale as a form of competition. Now, the regulator is making it clear that EPCOs can

only control the terms of the initial sale and should have no influence on further
transactions related to electricity. In theory, this should allow for a more open power
market and boost derivatives.



TEPCO begins test removal of fuel debris from Fukushima Unit 1
(Nikkei, Sept 10)
•  TEPCO began a test removal of fuel debris from Fukushima Daiichi NPP Unit 1. Over the next two
weeks, TEPCO plans to remove small amounts of the melted debris, weighing less than 3 grams.
•  An earlier attempt on Aug 22 was halted due to incorrect pipe connections assembled by a

subcontractor.
•  CONTEXT: The debris resulted from the March 2011 accident in Units 1 to 3, when nuclear fuel
melted and mixed with internal structures. An estimated 880 tons of debris remain strewn across
the three reactors. TEPCO planned to start removal by late 2021, but it has been delayed three
times. TEPCO plans to complete decommissioning by 2051.
• TAKEAWAY: The radioactive debris prevents human access; thus, TEPCO had to resort to robots and drones.
This test phase is critical for decommissioning. If this and following trial tests are successful, TEPCO will employ

larger devices for removal.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kyushu Electric to begin regular inspection of Sendai NPP Unit 2

(Company statement, Sept 12)
o  On Sept 14, Kyushu Electric will begin a regular inspection of Sendai NPP Unit 2
(Kagoshima Pref). The unit resumes operations on Dec 25.
o  The utility will replace part of the 157 fuel assemblies, and also connect relocated
electrical equipment to the Unit 2 generator.
o  Sendai NPP Unit 1 is now in the final stage of its regular inspection, and normal

operations resume on Sept 25.

(Company statement, Sept 10)
•  J-Power now expects operation of Tachibana Bay Thermal Power Station Unit 1 to resume by late
November. Operation had been suspended due to a crack in the high-temperature reheating

steam pipe, discovered in February.
•  The company expected operations to resume by late February 2025, but after the company
replaced the damaged pipe, it announced the restart ahead of schedule.
•  CONTEXT: In May, J-Power expected the suspension of operations to reduce sales by ¥18 billion
for FY2024. The firm is now reassessing the financial impact in light of the earlier-than-expected
resumption.



Narita Airport to import jet fuel from Shell

(Nikkei, Sept 10)
•  Narita International Airport Corp authorized Shell to use the pipeline that connects the airport and
a port in the city of Chiba to supply imported jet fuel to airlines.
•  CONTEXT: Some airports have been hit with jet fuel shortages due to limited truck and ship
availability to transport the fuel from refineries. In July, Japanese refineries exported 698,817
kiloliters (4.4 mln barrels) of jet fuel, but there were no imports. Jet fuel demand begins to drop
after August, but rises in December.

ANRE strengthens fossil fuel supply schemes for energy security
(Government statement, Sept 11)
•  ANRE is strengthening measures to ensure supplies of fossil fuels including coal. Japan’s energy

security strategy has thus far been LNG-focused, but now it has added coal for the first time.
•  To bring LNG supply security to higher levels:
o  ANRE plans a new “LNG stability index”, assessing the reliability of importers on the ratio
of long-term contracts, upstream project stakes, etc.
o  ANRE seeks vacant oil storage tanks in and outside Japan to stockpile LNG.
o  Officials will introduce a new classification of LNG supplies: Emergency, Collaborative,

and Competitive stocks.
o  There’ll be further expansion and promotion of the Coalition for LNG Emission
Abatement toward net-zero (CLEAN) framework, inviting the private sector to join.
•  Energy security status for coal is seen by the government as imperative because financial
institutions have divested coal assets in recent years, bringing down the coal self-sufficiency rate to
40.8% from 61.1% in 2016. The status would aim to justify the lending on security grounds.

ANALYSIS

Candidates Favor Realistic Energy Policies in LDP Leadership Race

The most diverse, unpredictable and even chaotic leadership race to determine a
successor to outgoing Prime Minister Kishida will culminate in a vote on Sept 27. For
all the drama and rhetoric, however, energy policy is one of the few issues on which
almost all the candidates converge.

Of the nine candidates vying to become the head of the ruling LDP, and thus
automatically the prime minister, all but one support nuclear energy in some form,
and all but one seem keen to promote renewable energy. In prior years, the two
stances were often set apart and politicians would align with one or the other. Japan’s
current situation seems to have blunted the ideological dichotomy. Instead, there is
growing emphasis on the need for both to coexist.

This lean into pragmatism on the energy front follows two key realizations among the
public and lawmakers. One is that electricity prices in Japan’s post-2016 liberalized
market can go up, as well as down, and even rise rapidly – due to wars, transport and
climate issues, and a weaker domestic currency. The other is that the government’s
digital push and tech revival, coupled with a global AI boom, will have unintended
consequences: namely, the need for much more energy.

Japan’s energy policy is at a critical juncture as the government is revising the Basic
Energy Plan this fiscal year. Before stepping down, Kishida has redoubled the effort to
restart TEPCO's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant after years of issues.
Whether the new premier will support the replacement of aging reactors with new
ones is unclear, but policy battle lines are no longer starkly drawn. There is a greater
urgency to utilize all possible options.

Under the circumstances, several of the LDP candidates have noticeably revised their
prior stance on energy planning. Japan NRG takes a closer look at where each stands.

Elections primer
Official candidacy for an LDP leadership election requires the endorsement of 20 MPs.
In the showdown on election day, 367 votes from local constituencies and 367 MP
votes will be cast. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff will immediately follow
between the top two candidates, with a significantly greater weight given to the MP
portion. The total number of votes in round two is 414 (367 MPs and 47 prefectural
chapters).


By early October, a new prime minister will be nominated by the Diet. To ensure that
the LDP remains in power, the new Prime Minister is likely to call a snap election
immediately, with the possibility of a general election as early as the first half of
November.

Regarded as a frontrunner, Koizumi Shinjiro, was once a cheerleader for green energy
when he served as Environment Minister, successfully raising the target for renewable
energy to 36-38% of Japan's national energy mix by 2030 in the current version of the
19

Basic Energy Plan. While he once opposed the restart of reactors and the construction
of additional nuclear power plants, in recent months he has modified his antagonism.
Now he says that without restarting reactors, Japan could soon face an electricity
shortage.

Still, following in the footsteps of his father and ex-premier Koizumi Junichiro, his
reformist spirit appears to be intact. Recently, in regard to decarbonization-related
business opportunities, Koizumi expressed his hope for Toyota to lead a
transformation of the auto industry. He even asserted that Japan's eight automakers
can’t afford to compete against each other in the domestic market.

Another major candidate, Kono Taro, dramatically repositioned his energy policy at
the press conference announcing his bid. Formerly the rare anti-nuclear figure in the
party, he said: “We must invest in all available technologies to maximize power
supply,” citing the expected power demand hike. Kono also admitted the potential
need to replace existing NPPs. Likewise, his stubborn objection to the recycling of
nuclear waste has now disappeared.

One of the eye-grabbing young candidates is Kobayashi Takayuk (age 49). An ex-
MOFA official and former Economic Security Minister, Kobayashi has similarly
changed his energy stance over the years. A decade ago, he advocated for reducing
dependence on nuclear power, but by 2018 he shifted to a position that nuclear
power is indispensable and that Japan should consider new nuclear plants.

Instead, Kobayashi criticizes the current Basic Energy Plan as too focused on
renewables. He stresses the need to push for the relaunch of nuclear reactors, while
arguing that adding further renewables capacity causes issues including volatility of
power supply and rising electricity costs.


Meanwhile, Kobayashi praised fusion energy as "wonderful" for several reasons: its
potential as a major energy source, inherent safety, the lack of high-level radioactive
waste, and the abundance of energy sources. A nationalist, Kobayashi has also
slammed Japan's Fusion Energy Innovation Strategy unveiled last year, urging the
government to accelerate the target year for commercial use in the wake of fierce
global competition.

Takaichi Sanae, another popular nationalist contender, was the author of this fusion
strategy, but she has also pledged to revise it and invest in refrigerant application
technologies for energy conservation. Takaichi’s objective is to have Japan move
towards 100% energy self-sufficiency. In addition to believing in the restart of existing
reactors, she wants the country to shift to SMRs and bet more on fusion energy.
Takaichi is one of the few politicians also addressing the issue of critical raw materials,
seeing a need to develop domestic production of rare earths and other key metals.

Ishiba Shigeru, one of the three candidates alongside Koizumi and Takaichi seen as
most likely to make it through to the second round, is the lone antinuclear voice this
time.

“We should make every effort to reduce our reliance on nuclear power. This will be
achieved through use of renewable energy, such as solar and wind,” said Ishiba.

20

He highlighted the potential of small-scale hydropower and geothermal energy. But
he stopped short of dismissing the option of replacing or building new nuclear power
facilities.

Second round politics
In the likely scenario of a second-round runoff due to no single candidate immediately
winning outright, it will be crucial to gain the support of other camps that no longer
have a chance of winning. In this context, it’s worth examining the energy policies of
less prominent candidates.

Koizumi can already bank on the support of Noda Seiko, an experienced lawmaker
who originally planned to run but failed to secure enough endorsements. He may also
pick up the vote and supporters of current METI Minister Saito Ken. Saito suffered a
similar fate to Noda and bowed out of the race a day before the official candidate
registration deadline. His backers are reported to include Obuchi Yuko, chair of the
LDP election campaign committee, and former Justice Minister Furukawa Sadahisa.

Saito hasn’t yet announced which candidate he’ll now support, but he recently said it
was important to maximize decarbonized energy supply as the investors of data
centers demand. In this light, he said, “The next Energy Basic Plan is in an extremely
challenging situation. The only certainty is that we will focus on maximizing the use of
renewable energy”.

Some veteran lawmakers that in previous years would have been seen as a shoe-in for
the top post are polling very badly. One of these is Motegi Toshimitsu, who headed
METI under the Abe administration, revising the Basic Energy Plan, which reversed the
zero-nuclear course. Joining the race, he has shown strong enthusiasm for continuing
with Kishida’s Green Transformation (GX) strategy.


Like Takaichi, Motegi is keen on administrative reforms, eying the integration of MoE
and ANRE.

Another well-spoken veteran with weak support numbers is current Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa, who advocates for advancing the integrated
development of data centers and power plants. On the other hand, former Chief
Cabinet Secretary under the renewables-inclined Suga Yoshihide government, Kato
Katsunobu, is committed to researching and developing new technologies such as
offshore wind power, hydrogen energy, and energy storage batteries.

Finally, attention should also be paid to who emerges as kingmaker after this fierce
political battle. Suga, who publicly endorsed Koizumi and set the course for
decarbonization and more renewable energy while Prime Minister, might return to the
commanding heights of the political arena.

Suga set Japan on course for net-zero 2050. At a time of pragmatism, his ideological
alignment may yet alter the flavor of Japan’s next Basic Energy Plan and the GX
strategy.

Energy Jobs in Japan: The Country as a Regional Talent Hub

In the Asia Pacific region, Singapore has traditionally been seen as the primary
regional hub. Its central location provides easy access to all key Asian markets.
Political stability, public safety, high levels of education, and low income and
corporate taxes make it an attractive location for global executives to be based.

Boasting a multicultural population and world-class education system has fostered a
capable talent pool, which can be found employed widely in the energy sector,
especially in investment and trading functions.

As Asia Pacific is the largest growth market in the rapidly transforming energy sector,
Singapore’s talent, however, might not be enough to cover the increasing regional
demand.

Can Japan, which has traditionally been a leader in providing financing and
technology across the region, step up and play a larger role in providing regional
talent in Asia?


Let’s look at the talent that already exists in Japan with the capability to deliver
beyond, as well as arguments for Japan performing effectively as a regional hub, and
the challenges that will be faced both in hiring local talent and using Tokyo as an
expatriate base.

The case for Japan as a regional talent hub
The first in Japan’s trifecta of advantages is the history, ability and willingness to invest
heavily beyond her borders. Japanese banks have long been a leader in project
financing for major infrastructure projects across the region.

Contrary to popular belief, Japanese financiers are willing to move into new sectors
where a strong business case is presented; take, for example, Mizuho and SMBC’s
involvement in the world’s largest BESS project financing deal with BlackRock’s
Akaysha Energy.

Beyond debt financing, Japanese corporations, from the large trading houses to mid-
sized energy developers such as Renova and Shizen Energy, are leading the charge in
renewable energy development across Southeast Asia for both utility scale and
commercial/ industrial projects.

Toyota Tsusho’s Eurus Energy is one of the largest developers and operators of wind
farms in Australia. Traditional utilities and oil & gas companies, such as JERA and
INPEX, have long been heavy investors across LNG and thermal infrastructure in the
Asian and Oceania regions, with their investments ever increasing.

Through GX initiatives, the Japanese government is clearly pushing a new industrial
revolution, with the goal of increasing its position as a technology exporter, even

though China has a leading position in traditional photovoltaic and battery
technologies.

Japanese corporations are heavily investing in perovskites and solid state battery
technologies. Beyond this, Japan has long been a technology leader in turbines,
piping and other key infrastructure for hydrocarbons, and actively looking to retain a
leading position to drive hydrogen, ammonia and other clean fuel technologies. In
addition, Japanese engineering firms have been central in designing, constructing
and operating energy infrastructure across the region.

Demand makes up the third and most recent facet in Japan’s regional leadership
potential. Japanese corporations are second only to the U.S. in the number of
companies signed up to RE100 (committing to 100% renewable energy).

As manufacturing has been offshored in recent decades, and pressure is on
corporations to mitigate not only their direct impact but also to improve Scope 2 & 3
emissions, Japanese firms have a vested interest in decarbonising operations and
supply chains, especially throughout Southeast Asia.

What talent does Japan offer?
Like Singapore, Japan has world class educational institutions, with four of the top 100
technical universities, and seven of the top institutions for finance and economics.
Every year, Japan turns out a high volume of intelligent, well-educated young
professionals.


Largely as a result of Japan’s legacy culture of lifetime employment, as well as a focus
on job security and high social standing based upon one’s employer, large Japanese
firms with a significant international footprint tend to hire the bulk of graduates from
top universities. These include Japanese megabanks and development banks, trading
companies, engineering firms and technology manufacturers.

From a corporate perspective, Japan already has a sizable, well-educated, healthy
talent pool with strong track records and who can function at a regional or even global
level.

Challenges in accessing Japanese talent
The question ‘Can global firms hire globally minded Japanese talent?’ is key here. As
described above, the Japanese education system produces sufficient talent, and
domestic companies have easy access to such talent. Why then, do foreign firms
struggle to find qualified, bilingual, global minded talent?

The answer lies in the fact that the bulk of multinational firms look to hire Japanese
talent for their in-country business, not as regional or international talent. The
opportunity for these professionals to work on APAC projects is most often very
limited.

In most cases, large Japanese firms, whether we are talking about trading houses,
EPC firms, banks or otherwise, have a clear divide between international and domestic
divisions. This results in the following conundrum:

A. The international focused talent are bilingual and globally minded; however they
are not experienced in domestic projects, often not familiar with local
regulations, and their primary interest is working in a global setting.
B. Domestic focused talent, however, have all the necessary network, market
knowledge and track record to deliver on domestic projects; but >90% of this

talent pool are monolingual Japanese, and tend to take a more conservative
approach to career development.

In recent years, we’ve seen a handful of multinational firms hiring Japanese talent for
positions that will be Tokyo-based, covering both domestic and regional investments
and projects. This is a winning combination that attracts the most relevant, interested
and willing candidates to join and deliver value both in the Japanese market and on a
wider regional scale.

Japan as an expat hub?
From a global corporate perspective, there will likely be significant business ties to
Japan even without having projects on the ground. Whether it be debt financing from
Japanese banks, joint ventures with trading houses or utility companies, or simply
procuring equipment and services from Japanese manufacturers and engineering
firms, most energy companies active in the APAC region will have strong business ties
to Japanese companies.

Though we have seen some large global firms place expatriates into Tokyo to play a
regional role, this is still the exception, not the rule. For an expat, Japan is not easy
from a travel and language perspective, where basic things such as opening bank
accounts, and securing accommodation cause more challenges than in other locales.

Cost can also be an obstacle, with high taxation rates, as well as costs for international
education and luxuries that may be considered normal in the expat’s home country,
such as a family car.


Whether it be financial, technical, commercial, or project management specialists,
Japan has cultivated a solid pool of talent with experience in global projects.

Developing your business to allow these professionals to leverage their experience at
a regional level will unlock a talent pool beyond the traditional regional hub of
Singapore.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Solar power and BESS
In Queensland, the local arm of Spain’s Iberdrola began building a solar-plus-storage
with a 180 MW/ 260 MWh battery system. The Broadsound Solar and Battery will
feature 376 MW of solar PV alongside the co-located BESS. The power will be
exported to the grid.

China / Coal power
China accounts for more than half of the world's pipeline of new coal mines, said
Global Energy Monitor. China is developing enough new mines to produce 1.28
billion metric tons of coal each year.

China / Energy infrastructure
The Baker Institute in Houston published a detailed map of China’s energy
infrastructure. The map can be found at this link.

India / Green hydrogen
India seeks to attract $9.52 billion in investment to boost efforts to develop its green
hydrogen sector as part of its National Green Hydrogen Mission.

Indonesia / Green financing
The country is still waiting for cheaper financing to retire its coal-fired power fleet. The
country was promised $20 billion as part of the G7's Just Energy Transition
Partnership, but very little has been disbursed. Indonesia requires $94.6 billion by
2030 to develop clean power transmission and generation.

LNG
At the APPEC conference in Singapore, major LNG buyers raised concerns over
sourcing cargoes from the U.S. in the wake of the White House’s pause on export
permits to countries without Free Trade Agreements. The move has sparked concern
among key industry players, particularly in Asia, where energy security and supply
reliability are paramount.

Pakistan / Electricity rates
Pakistan is renegotiating contracts with independent power producers to rein in
unsustainable electricity tariffs, the power ministry said. Rising power tariffs have
stirred social unrest and shuttered industries as inflation hits record highs.

Oil refining
Last week, Asian refiner margins slumped to their lowest seasonal levels since 2020 as
supplies of diesel and gasoline rose after peak summer travel demand ended. Asia
has been cutting runs since May by 400,000-500,000 bpd. Persistent weak margins
could prompt refiners to trim output again, adding to a round of cuts that took place
earlier in the year.

The Energy Market Authority, which is responsible for Singapore’s energy supply, has
granted conditional approvals to seven Indonesia power projects that would allow the
city-state to import a total of 3.4 GW of low-carbon electricity.

UAE / Nuclear power
Emirates Nuclear Energy Co and the Nuclear Power Corp of India inked an MoU for
the maintenance and operations of the Barakah NPP, which is the UAE’s first NPP, and
the first on the Arabian Peninsula. It’s located close to the border with Qatar.
