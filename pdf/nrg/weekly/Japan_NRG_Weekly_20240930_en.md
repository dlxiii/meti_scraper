NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Ishiba Shigeru, lone anti-nuclear voice wins LDP leadership race, set to become next PM

(Government statement, Sept 27)
•  In a runoff for the LDP leadership on Sept 27, Ishiba Shigeru, the party's former general secretary,
defeated Takaichi Sanae, a nuclear enthusiast and fusion energy advocate. He’s set to become the
new prime minister on Oct 1.
•  The 67-year-old was the lone antinuclear voice in the battle of nine contenders. Announcing his
bid in summer, he said, “We should make every effort to reduce our reliance on nuclear power”.
However, as the campaign went on, he modified his position: “A stable energy supply is the

lifeblood of the nation, and it is only natural to maximize safety and tap into every potential
resource.”
•  Ishiba appeared to have earned ballots through renewables cheerleaders such as Koizumi Shinjiro,
Kono Taro, and Suga Yoshihide in the second round. Thus, his true color in energy policy will be
revealed further upon his cabinet formation.
•  He indicated it was necessary to proceed with the restart of nuclear power reactors, but he has
stopped short of dismissing the option of replacing or building new nuclear power facilities. He

also highlighted the potential of small-scale hydro and geothermal energy to sustain regional
economies, while pushing energy conservation efforts to the fullest.
•  Following Ishiba's victory, Keidanren Chairman Tokura Masakazu stressed, "Maximizing the use of
nuclear power that serves as the foundation of domestic industry is indispensable for energy
policy.” Ishiba stated his intention to pass the supplementary budget to deal with rising energy
costs, among other purposes.
• TAKEAWAY: Ishiba is labeled as both a progressive and a hawk, a reformer and a conservative. For some, even

in government, his comments are hard to pin down; he was perhaps the least predictable of all the candidates
that ran in the LDP election. In the past, Ishiba has advocated for Japan to avoid being too reliant on the U.S.
alliance, preferring a quieter international voice and a position in between that of the U.S. and China. How this
will play out in practice is anyone’s guess. But in the energy arena, his first test may come with the restart of
TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP. Outgoing PM Kishida expended considerable effort in his last few weeks in
office to move the restart forward. Whether Ishiba feels the need to follow, or push the issue to the side and

focus on the next Basic Energy Plan, will give us some idea on what kind of direction he wants in the energy
space.



Japan-U.S. energy event calls for coordinated clean energy action to decarbonize

(Government statement, Sept 25)
•  Japanese and American officials and business execs met to agree on the need for the public and
private sectors to coordinate in a bid to expand the supply of decarbonized power in Japan.
•  They also highlighted the need to address the reliability of supply and competition issues amid
collaboration.

•  The roundtable, hosted by Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) and the U.S. Department of
State, was a program to develop synergy between the Japanese green transformation (GX) and the
U.S. Inflation Reduction Act programs.
•  CONTEXT: CEBA is an evolution of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance that moved to the
broader "clean energy" concept in 2021 from an earlier focus on "renewables".

• TAKEAWAY: METI’s discussions with major U.S. power users such as Microsoft, which have made
commitments to use 100% CO2-free electricity globally by 2030, reveals several things. First, big U.S.
technology firms are worried about their ability to secure enough CO2-free electricity in Japan to meet their
commitments locally. Recently, Google said that only about a third of its electricity in Japanese data centers
meets the firm's decarbonization goals. Second, U.S. tech firms are now more open to other CO2-free
electricity options outside of solar, wind and battery power sources. In the U.S., the tech sector has grown
increasingly interested in nuclear power. In Japan, the potential to use electricity from NPPs remains a

possibility -- if more of the current facilities are restarted.



Hydrogen sector sees $75 billion commitment to growth amid rapid rise in investment
(Japan NRG, Sept 18)
•  Over the past four years there’s been a seven-fold increase in capital investment in the hydrogen

sector, now totalling $75 billion, the Hydrogen Council said during Gastech 2024 in Houston,
Texas.
•  This figure covers 434 different projects that have reached the final investment stage compared to
102 projects in 2022.
•  However, the Council admitted there are many obstacles to overcome – for example, it expects
that only 25% of planned projects will reach fruition by 2030.
•  “Putting together [hydrogen] deals is very difficult; these are very complex deals with companies

that have complex structures,” said Michael Ducker, senior VP and head of hydrogen infrastructure
at Mitsubishi Power Americas, adding that it’s important to find reliable partners and to be
transparent about risks, and to build trust.
•  Ducker said the complexity of the hydrogen supply chain is the most daunting obstacle, leading to
a myriad of risks that slow development. He called on the global community to set standards for
the industry to diminish risk.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Iwatani accelerates hydrogen station development as FCV demand rises
(Nikkei, Sept 9)
o  Iwatani Corp is speeding up hydrogen station construction, driven by renewed global
interest in fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), particularly in Europe and California.
o  The company is focusing on large FCVs like trucks and buses, having opened a large
hydrogen station in Tokyo, with plans for more in the city by 2025.
o  Iwatani is also expanding hydrogen use in power generation, including projects for co-

firing hydrogen with LNG and supplying hydrogen to industrial boilers.
o  CONTEXT: Iwatani is Japan’s top supplier of liquid hydrogen.

EGC official sees "room for improvement" in fuel cost adjustment cap
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 20)
•  Matsumura Toshihiro, a member of the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC)
and a professor at Tokyo University, discussed the fuel cost adjustment system for regulated tariffs,

saying there’s "room for improvement."
•  He emphasized that reforms, such as removing the cap or increasing the "1.5x" condition, are
"natural changes," and noted the possibility of discussing making power spot market prices a
reference when calculating the adjustment.
•  However, Matsumura was negative on relaxing conditions for removal of regulated tariffs, stating
that "even now, the conditions are unbelievably lax." He was appointed to the commission on
Sept 2.

•  Matsumura said "regulated tariffs are a safety net" and that the "new power companies' argument
is valid, but abolishing the tariffs would be too hasty."
•  CONTEXT: There have been calls from non-EPCO market participants (also known as new power
companies, or shin denryoku) to remove regulated tariffs, claiming they distort competition. The
fuel adjustment system was created to externalize the impact of fuel prices and exchange rates,
which are beyond the control of power companies. The fuel cost adjustment for tariffs sets a cap

on how much of the fuel cost can be passed on to consumers. Specifically, if the average fuel price
exceeds 1.5 times the base price, the excess can’t be passed on to consumers, and becomes a
burden on the power companies. Kansai Electric and Kyushu Electric are exceeding this cap.



ANRE to revise criteria for power reserve measures
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 27)
•  ANRE plans to revise the criteria for activating additional power supply measures when the
regional reserve rate drops, lowering the threshold to 5% from the current 8% for fiscal 2024.
•  The change is prompted by this year’s increasing number of cases of regional power grids asking

for additional power supplies from other areas when their capacity reserves fell below the limit
deemed sufficient to maintain stable electricity supply.
•  The Tokyo and Chubu areas in particular have required help from other TSOs. ANRE also plans to
look at other measures, such as better hydropower resource management.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE mulls ‘charging limits’ as measures for early connection of grid-scale BESS

(Government statement, Sept 18)
•  METI and ANRE are considering early grid connection of storage battery systems, but on the
premise that charging would be restricted when power demand exceeds the grid’s operational
capacity.
•  CONTEXT: The number of firms considering BESS for the grid has increased five-fold since May, to
about 60 GW; and the number of applications for connection contracts has risen four-fold in the
same period to about 4.5 GW.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE sets heat pump demand response policy
(Government statement, Sept 18)
o  ANRE has set FY2030 as the target to require IoT connected heat pumps to
accommodate electricity demand response (DR-ready) measures.

o  CONTEXT: The Energy Conservation Subcommittee set up the DR-ready Study Group to
discuss requirements. DR-ready refers to the ability of consumer-side energy equipment
to respond to demand response via remote operation.



Calls for regulation as surge in copper thefts disrupts solar farms
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 19)
•  High copper prices have led to over 300 cases of copper cable theft from solar power plants,
causing significant losses.
•  CONTEXT: Copper has more than doubled in price since 2019.

•  In some cases, stolen cables and halted operations have resulted in damages exceeding ¥100
million, with one instance involving 16 km of stolen cable.
•  Solar industry groups are urging a registration system for scrap metal dealers, as seen in other
Asian countries, which would require proof of identity and detailed transaction records to prevent
the sale of stolen materials and reduce theft.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan NRG covered this problem in the Oct 16, 2023, issue, and then the police were trying to

increase awareness of the crimes. A continued surge in copper prices (nearing $10,000/ ton earlier this year)
and other base metals has only fanned the flames. The challenge with creating additional regulation, however,
is that it inevitably increases industry costs, while thieves could just as easily sell their stock to pawn shops.
Also, making life more complicated for scrap metal collectors will hurt efforts to usher in a more circular
economy and improve recycling rates.




Sekisui, TEPCO awarded Green Innovation funding for PSC studies
(Government statement, Sept 20)
•  Sekisui Chemical and TEPCO Holdings were awarded a ¥37.8 billion grant from the state-run
Green Innovation Fund to develop mass production of perovskite solar cells (PSC) and to conduct
PSC field tests with end-users. The funding starts this fiscal year and ends in FY2030.
•  The companies will explore the best materials, equipment and processes to improve Sekisui's

proprietary roll-to-roll method, and develop PSC module installation methods on high rise building
walls, etc.
•  CONTEXT: TEPCO Holdings plans to build a skyscraper in Tokyo with Sekisui's PSC systems that
generates 1 MW of power; it would be Japan’s largest PSC project.

Chugoku Electric, etc study large-scale use of negative emission BECCS tech
(Company statement, Sept 25)
•  Chugoku Electric, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Toshiba Energy Systems, and JGC Global began
designing and studying CCS facilities at the Hofu Biomass Power Plant in preparation for the first

large-scale negative emissions BESS in Japan in 2030.
•  The fuel used is 45% coal and 55% woody biomass; the facility will recover about 500,000 t-CO2/
year.
•  CONTEXT: BECCS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) is a negative emission
technology. Biomass fuel is carbon neutral because it absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, but
when the CO2 from burning biomass is also captured and stored, it leads to a net reduction of
CO2 in the atmosphere.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Marubeni joins CCS projects in Texas with Ozona CCS
(Company statement, Sept 24)
o  Marubeni inked a JV with Ozona CCS to develop a commercial CCS project in southwest
Texas. Marubeni will have a 50% stake.
o  The CO2 will be captured from gas production and processing plants, and then

transported via pipelines.
o  The CO2 will be stored in saline aquifers 2-3 km underground. A final investment
decision is expected by mid-2025; commercial operations are slated for 2026.
o  CONTEXT: The U.S. has a goal of reducing GHG emissions 65% by 2030, and achieving
net-zero by 2050. It’s backed by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
JX Nippon Oil & Gas tests CO2 liquefaction, could lower CCS costs

(Nikkei, Sept 13)
o  JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration held a demo test of CO2 liquefaction at ambient
temperature. The new method could reduce energy consumption by up to 20%
compared to conventional techniques. It aims to lower costs for CCS projects.
o  The tech uses pressure to liquefy CO2, and doesn’t need refrigerants.

ENEOS Renewable Energy to join floating offshore wind in Norway, takes 20% stake

(Company statement, Sept 18)
•  ENEOS Renewable Energy (ERE) is set to acquire a 20% stake in the GoliatVIND floating offshore
wind project in Norway.
•  The site is on the border between the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. The project has an installed
capacity of 75 MW, using five 15 MW wind turbines.
•  This is ERE's first overseas offshore wind project. It will be developed with Source Galileo, Odfjell
Oceanwind and KEPCO, which also has a 20% stake. They aim to begin commercial operation in

2028.
•  CONTEXT: Norway has set a target of 30 GW of offshore wind power by 2040. GoliatVIND
received a grant of 2 billion NOK from Norway.
•  CONTEXT: ERE’s first floating offshore wind
project, 16.8 MW near Goto City, Nagasaki
Pref, was halted due to defects in two
floating structures under construction, and

launch has been pushed to January 2026.
• TAKEAWAY: With the push for offshore wind power,
Japan has fostered a competitive environment for firms.
Cooperation with European firms, which are far more
advanced, is indispensable for Japan to introduce
floating wind tech at home. The Norwegian project

offers a great opportunity for ERE to gain experience
with its delayed Goto project. Still, to successfully
introduce floating offshore wind power in Japan, more
adjustments within organizations involved in such
projects, and coordination between them, will be
needed.

•  CONTEXT: September has fewer business days than usual due to the Silver Week of public
holidays; however, trading volumes have not dipped. In fact, they are on track to come near the
6.6 TWh record monthly traded volume that occurred in February this year. The 2024 burst in
trades has already seen 2024 comfortably beat the 2023 annual volume of 18.3 TWh. In just the
first six months of 2024, volumes hit 28.9 TWh. Monthly and quarterly derivatives contracts remain

the most popular trades on the EEX; however daily contracts have accounted for as much as 40%
of trades in certain months, according to the exchange.
•  CONTEXT: The EEX says it has a 98.5% share of Japan’s futures power market, with TOCOM the
rest. There are 77 trading participants on the EEX as of June 2024.

Kansai area received power from six regions amid robust demand on high temperatures

(Company statement, Sept 18)
•  On Sept 18, OCCTO directed KEPCO to receive electricity from other transmission service
operators (TSOs) as the reserve ratio for power capacity in the Kansai area was due to fall below
the minimum 3% reserve margin as hot temperatures led to increased power demand.
•  KEPCO secured the following power between 16:00 and 18:30:
o 329 MW from Tohoku,
o 410 MW from Tokyo,

o 380 MW from Chubu,
o 300 MW from Hokuriku,
o 750 MW from Chugoku,
o 300 MW from Shikoku.
•  CONTEXT: When there is a power shortage in any area, OCCTO has the prerogative to order
TSOs to supply other areas with surplus output.
• TAKEAWAY: The number of power transfers between regions has risen due to the volatility in weather,

extreme heat, and further intermittency in the power sources. The main issue, however, is that the number of
times a regional grid operator can request help is limited to about 12 times a year. The Tokyo area TSO has
already requested help 10 times this year, which is a worrying sign as we head towards the peak demand
period in winter.

IEA’s Tanaka Nobuo talks future of Japan’s nuclear industry, sees hope for SMRs
(Japan NRG, Sept 20)
•  Tanaka Nobuo, executive director emeritus of the IEA, talked about the future of Japan's nuclear
sector at the annual Gastech in Houston, Texas. He said the govt is investing in advanced reactors,
such as fast reactors, gas-cooled reactors and SMRs.
•  Yet, utilities are still bound to technologies like large light-water reactors. The reason is that they

believe the older tech has advantages from a regulatory point of view, as well as in terms of
training people and the supply chain.
•  Tanaka said that the costs for building new ones is too high and the future of the nuclear sector is
in SMRs.
•  Tanaka also said that a fast-neutron reactor (FNR) will be an efficient way of using uranium, that it
offers advantages in nuclear waste management, and could be helpful even for removing

Fukushima's contaminated debris.
•  CONTEXT: A FNR is a nuclear reactor that uses fast neutrons without the need for a neutron
moderator to slow them. Unlike conventional thermal reactors, FNRs can use a wider range of
nuclear fuels such as depleted uranium and plutonium. This can reduce the volume and toxicity of
nuclear waste

•  Companies like Toshiba and Fuji Electric also intend to increase staff. Fuji Electric seeks new
employees for designing high-temperature gas-cooled reactors.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s nuclear workforce stands at about 50,000. Yet, the aging of experienced
professionals and a lack of new construction have led to difficulties in passing on critical skills.
Companies like Hitachi are using digital technologies, such as metaverse spaces and 3D CAD, to

help with skill transfer. Additionally, KEPCO is offering technical training to support skill retention.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s aging workforce is, in general, a problem; but the nuclear industry faces additional issues.
The number of nuclear engineering students has declined since the Fukushima accident. Also, a large part of
the industry's employees have been working in non-operating facilities since the shutdown of all NPPs in the
early 2010s.

ANALYSIS

Natural Gas Sector Bets on a Rebound as Power Demand Rises on
Data Center Boom

After a tumultuous five years marked by calls to bury the natural gas industry amid
efforts to decarbonize the sector, along with wild price volatility that saw historic lows
in 2020, record highs in 2022 and a plunge again this year, corporate leaders now see
the potential for long-term prosperity.

This new confidence is driven by a forecasted rise in global energy demand ignited by
the rapid expansion of energy-hungry data centers and AI technologies. The next five
years will see a natural gas supply boom that should keep prices affordable for
developing countries, thereby opening new markets that hitherto relied on cheaper
coal power.

What a difference a year makes. In November 2023, the United Nations’ COP28
climate summit loudly announced what activists called the “beginning of the end of
the fossil fuel era.” However, the natural gas industry’s buoyant future can easily be
discerned in the more than 1,000 orders to build LNG maritime transport vessels.


The recent Gastech conference in Houston, held from September 17-20, radiated this
optimism. Industry leaders reaffirmed the role of natural gas in the global energy mix,
with a clear focus on expanding market share, particularly at coal’s expense.

However, the sector is not resistant to change. Many gas companies are exploring
hydrogen and other alternative energy options to lower their carbon footprint.

All these developments will have a significant impact on Japan, the world’s second
LNG buyer after China, and a nation that still relies on burning gas for over a third of
its electricity.

Asia propels rising LNG demand
The natural gas industry believes it can bridge the so-called ‘energy gap’ until
renewables becomes the global baseload energy source by 2050.

Despite progress in building renewables capacity over the past two decades, fossil
fuels – coal, oil, and gas – still supply nearly 80% of global energy, with coal alone
contributing 35% of the total. Renewable energy accounts for only 12%.

With renewables lagging in many parts of the world, including Japan, where large
offshore wind farms are expected to commence operations only at the end of this
decade, natural gas demand is expected to double over the next decade, peaking in
the early 2040s.

According to the International Energy Agency, by 2026, global power demand from
data centers could double, as AI technology takes off. For example, BlackRock is

planning a $30 billion AI investment fund with Microsoft, focusing on data centers and
energy projects.

Shell’s LNG Outlook 2024 forecasts LNG demand reaching 685 million tons per
annum by 2040, with Asia – especially China and India – driving much of the growth.
The U.S. and Qatar are poised to supply a significant portion of this gas, with over 200
million tons of new export capacity expected to come online globally by 2030.

China, already the world’s largest LNG importer, is expected to continue its annual
import growth of 13%, surpassing purchases of 85 million tons annually by 2024. And
India is aggressively increasing LNG imports to replace coal, with projections of 67
million tons by 2030, nearly triple its 23 million tons in FY2022.

In the past two years, Japan has slid from the top spot to the No 2 position, and its
total LNG imports are expected to slowly decline over the next decade as the country
boosts offshore wind, solar and nuclear capacity. In 2023, Japan imported about 65
million tons of LNG, down from about 72 million in 2022, and 88.5 million in 2014.

In spring, JERA’s new CEO Kani Yukio went on record saying that Japan’s import
volumes “may decline or may stay the same”, and that “Japan may not need LNG for
20 years ... but other Asian countries need to replace coal with something and LNG
will play an important role.” JERA, which is Japan’s largest power company and
largest natural gas buyer, hopes to continue to play a key role in supplying fuel to
neighboring countries.


At Gastech, Kani emphasized energy security while transitioning to cleaner energy.
During the Houston conference, JERA inked a 10-year contract with Woodside Energy
of Australia to deliver 600,000 tons of LNG per annum starting in April 2026. Earlier
this year, JERA took a 15% stake in Woodside's Scarborough project off Western
Australia.

Meanwhile European LNG imports from the U.S. held strong in early 2024. However,
selling LNG in the EU now faces more stringent regulations on methane emissions,
requiring rigorous monitoring to track leakage across supply chains. The natural gas
industry counters by claiming that its methane emissions only account for about 5% of
the global total. (The oil industry and agriculture sector emit more methane than the
natural gas industry)

Infrastructure investments and challenges
In the coming years substantial investments are anticipated in LNG liquefaction plants,
regasification terminals, and transportation infrastructure. Innovations in LNG
production, transport, and use are expected to drive efficiency improvements and
open new markets.

An estimated $55 billion is expected to be invested in new LNG supply globally in
2024 and 2025 only, but price and supply volatility raise concerns about the viability
of natural gas as a primary energy source for developing countries, which presently
prefer to stick with coal.

Emerging markets in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa are developing LNG
import infrastructures, with countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan seeking to enter
the market.

While the U.S. and Canada won’t build more gas-fired power generation capacity,
they’re eager to export LNG. By 2030, North America’s total LNG exports could
double, accounting for 30% of global demand. The U.S. has cemented its spot as the
world’s top LNG exporter, with Q1 2024 figures indicating that the total this year
might exceed 90 million tons.

By 2030, Shell plans to invest up to $13 billion in gas and its upstream, and the firm
plans to boost LNG sales 20-30% by expanding its presence in Canada and Mexico to
export LNG to Asia. One key project is the $30 billion LNG Canada facility in Kitimat,
British Columbia that’s backed by a consortium that includes Shell (40%), Petronas
(25%), Mitsubishi (15%), PetroChina (15%), and Korea Gas Corp (5%). This plant is the
first on Canada's West Coast, and the first cargo might ship in mid 2025.

In the Middle East, Qatar's North Field expansion is progressing, with new production
expected to come online by early 2025. African LNG exports from Mozambique and
Senegal are also in the works. In South America, Mexico and Argentina are
developing natural gas infrastructure and LNG export capacity.

In Asia, Mitsubishi Corp plans to boost its involvement in Malaysian LNG projects by
nearly 60% in terms of production capacity, and by late FY2024 the trading house will
acquire a 10% stake in a gas liquefaction plant in the state of Sarawak that’s operated
by Petronas.


Mitsubishi also holds a 10% stake in another LNG project in Sarawak and plans to
extend this contract in FY2025. It might invest several hundred billion yen, raising its
annual LNG production capacity in Malaysia from 1.4 million tons to 2.2 million tons.

With all these new projects expected to come online in the next few years, experts are
forecasting a glut of natural gas by 2027, which is why there is an urgency to open
new markets across Asia, Africa and Latin America to absorb this growing supply.

Political and environmental considerations
As the natural gas sector bets on a new era of growth, it faces challenges related to
environmental concerns and politics. Methane emissions remain a point of contention,
though the industry argues that displacing coal with natural gas could reduce global
emissions by 25%. However, this claim isn’t swaying many governments in North
America and Europe.

In the U.S., the LNG market has been caught in the domestic political crossfire of this
election year. In January, the Biden administration paused new LNG export approvals,
creating uncertainty for major projects like Calcasieu Pass 2 and Commonwealth LNG.

At Gastech, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth criticized the White House, arguing that the
LNG export pause hampers the transition from coal to natural gas, leading to higher


21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

energy costs and more emissions. Despite a federal court overturning the LNG
moratorium in July, no new permits have been issued.

At the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference in Singapore in early September, officials
from Taiwan’s CPC Corp and Germany’s SEFE spoke of the importance of reliable
LNG suppliers. CPC’s vice president, Jane Liao, stated her preference for traditional
suppliers, citing long-standing relationships to guarantee supply reliability.

This sentiment reflects a broader trend among many Asian LNG buyers. With the U.S.
export pause creating uncertainty, many are looking at diversifying their supply to
enhance security. Though the U.S. is the top LNG exporter, buyers increasingly have
more options.

With more and more sources of supply coming online by the end of the decade, and
developing economies eager to initiate and/or expand their purchases of LNG, the
industry is going to become a truly global market.

What does this mean for Japan? While Japanese utilities look at ways to shift away
from fossil fuel generation by 2050, this still leaves a 25-year horizon. Also, major
companies such as JERA see a role for them in the global market, for example, by
trading LNG to countries ranging from Southeast Asia to India.

Delays at Rokkasho Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Plant

Hinder Japan’s Energy Goals
The future and long-term success of Japan’s nuclear power industry hinges not only
on developing cutting edge, next-generation technology, but also on events taking
place in a small fishing village in northeast Japan.

Construction of the Rokkasho nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Aomori Prefecture on
the Pacific Ocean coast is central to Japan's nuclear fuel cycle policy. If construction is
ever completed it will be the nation’s main facility processing nuclear waste disposal.

Work on the facility was launched in 1993 and it should have been completed in 1997.
Yet, last month the project faced its 27th construction delay, and the operator, Japan
Nuclear Fuel Ltd, said the plant's completion will be postponed to 2026. Another two
and a half years are needed to address issues related to Nuclear Regulation Authority
regulatory reviews.


For decades, nuclear power energy was a strategic priority in Japan. The country’s first
nuclear power plant launched in 1966, and by March 2011, nuclear power accounted
for about 30% of Japan’s electricity production, with plans to boost that to 40%. The
Fukushima disaster, of course, changed all that. For ten or so years since, the sector
languished but power shortages and a desire to add cheaper, CO2-free generation to
the grid has brought nuclear back into public favor. Whether it can stay there will
depend on what happens when nuclear fuel is spent.

Unlike coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, nuclear power plants face the
disposal and long-term storage of their fuel – which becomes nuclear waste. Japan is
still unable to sufficiently resolve this issue, and until a solution is found that satisfies
all stakeholders.

Japan NRG takes a closer look at the challenges and what solutions are possible for
the disposal, storage and processing of spent nuclear fuel.

Fukushima’s impact on Japan’s reprocessing plants
As a country with scant domestic supplies of natural energy resources, for decades
Japan has had to rely heavily on imports for energy; currently, nearly 95% of Japan’s
energy is imported. Therefore, securing a stable energy supply has long been a
central facet of Japan’s industrial policy, and nuclear power was expected to fulfill
those needs.

Since Japan imports all the uranium for its nuclear power fleet, reprocessing and
reusing its spent nuclear fuel is considered a desired outcome. Towards that goal,
since the early 1990s, Japan has worked on building a facility to reprocess spent
nuclear fuel for further use.

The Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant, located in the village of the same name, is slated to
play a central role in Japan’s nuclear fuel management plans. But constant delays over

23

the past three decades have plagued the industry, and today, realization of the
nuclear fuel cycle seems as distant as ever. In the meantime, nuclear waste
accumulates on-site at the nation's NPPs.

The delays appear to stem from extended NRA screenings and internal
communication issues within JNFL. In some cases, JNFL failed to share information or
make necessary changes to approved plans.

Also, post-Fukushima, regulations became much stricter, increasing the necessary
safety upgrades and costs. The project's management involves many parties who
assist with technical matters required by the NRA. The coordination of all this only
added to the Rokkasho’s complexity.

Early successes
Until not so long ago Japan had a working reprocessing plant. In 1981, after ten years
of construction, a MOX fuel processing facility opened 120 km northeast of Tokyo – in
Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture. But it went idle in 2006 after commercial contracts for
fuel reprocessing dried up. During the years of its operation the plant reprocessed
1,140 tons of spent nuclear fuel.

The Tokai reprocessing plant was decommissioned due to the high costs of
modifications required by the new regulations post-Fukushima. As the rules for the
nuclear business became more stringent, once again, costs rose.

Without the Tokai facility, Japanese utilities have had to send spent nuclear fuel to the
UK and France for reprocessing. Today, the use of recycled fuel, mostly from France,
is limited to a few plants in Japan, especially for Kansai Electric (KEPCO). Currently,
MOX fuel is in use at KEPCO’s Takahama NPP Units 3-4, Shikoku Electric’s Ikata NPP
Unit 3, and Kyushu Electric’s NPP Unit 3.

Broken promises
Japan’s overall spent fuel storage capacity is about 24,000 tons, with over 80%
already used. By 2030, the major utilities have set a goal to add 6,000 tons to that
total capacity. That plan calls for an interim storage facility, such as the one on the
premises of Tokai No. 2 NPP, or the one in Mutsu (Aomori Pref) operated by TEPCO
and Japan Atomic Power. The latter, slated to launch in September, will primarily
serve TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPP, and will store 5,000 tons of spent fuel for 50
years before sending it to long-term storage.

KEPCO, Japan’s largest NPP operator, also has plans to use an interim storage facility
– to launch in the early 2030s at a site that has yet to be determined – for its spent
nuclear fuel. This was a crucial point in the plan proposed to Fukui Prefecture last year
thanks to which the utility secured local government approval for reactor restarts. In
addition, in August 2023, KEPCO, together with Chugoku Electric, began studying the
possibility of building a mid-term storage facility in Kaminoseki (Yamaguchi
Prefecture).

The setback of the Rokkasho plant completion has hit KEPCO hard. In autumn last
year, the company proposed a plan to Fukui Prefecture, promising to send the spent
fuel to an interim storage facility outside the prefecture's borders. In fact, the
company made such a promise in the late '90s but it has not been fulfilled and no
solution is in sight.


Now KEPCO says it can’t fulfill that promise at all until Rokkasho is completed. On
August 30, KEPCO and ANRE met with Fukui's Deputy Governor Washizu Mio to
report the plan’s revision. The governor said it violated the deal made with the
prefecture a year earlier, and the burden is on the utility to show a firm commitment
to resolving the issue.

When asked about the new plan’s timetable, KEPCO said it would present one as
soon as possible. While the company is not responsible for the delay, it was proposing
a plan that was dependent on the continuously postponed Rokkasho facility.

On Sept 5, KEPCO’s President Mori Nozomu also met Fukui Governor Sugimoto
Tatsuji, to discuss KEPCO’s spent fuel management plans. The Governor stressed the
importance of building trust between nuclear business operators and municipalities.
He also urged the company to present a revised plan as soon as possible. On Sept 9,

the Aomori Pref Governor asked ANRE to hold a conference on the Nuclear Fuel
Cycle with him and cabinet ministers.

KEPCO’s spent fuel can’t wait for Rokkasho’s plant to be complete. The utilization
rates for spent fuel pools at KEPCO plants are as follows:

Fuel      Fue
Utilization
NPP        assemblies’ assemblies
rate
capacity  stored
Mihama NPP   652       476     73%
Takahama NPP 3,758    3,223    86%
Oi NPP      3,872     3,459    89%
Conclusion
Given the high utilization rate of its NPP storage facilities, this summer KEPCO
resorted to another solution for storing the fuel, i.e. dry storage facilities within the
plants’ premises. (This solution will be discussed in Part II of this story, next week.)

The Rokkasho facility, however, remains central to Japan’s spent fuel management
plans, and there are no signs that the country plans to abandon its dream of realizing
a full nuclear fuel cycle. In the meantime, distrust is growing among the public and
state agencies. Delays at Rokkasho have led Aomori Governor Miyashita to doubt
JNFL's management ability.

As for the Mutsu interim storage facility, many fear that, despite its name and
intended use, it will end up storing nuclear material far longer than planned, since
there will be nowhere else to ship spent nuclear fuel.

The same goes for the proposed facility in Kaminoseki. While Chugoku Electric is
trying to restart its Shimane NPP Unit 2, locals fear that the company will end up
lending the storage facility to KEPCO, which will then use it for its spent fuel coming
from outside of the company’s jurisdiction. Needless to say, the locals are not
enthusiastic. The idea of living in the proximity of large amounts of nuclear fuel is not
appealing for many locals.

Unless the government finds a way to propose a viable plan for its nuclear fuel cycle
and adhere to it, dismissing local criticisms and skepticism as mere symptoms of the
“not in my backyard” mentality will ring hollow.


Repeated delays and broken promises from major industry stakeholders only make
things worse when it comes to securing public trust. In turn, this only serves to compel
nuclear operators to continuously replan and review their commitments.

If in the next few years Japan cannot make tangible progress toward its goal for long-
term spent nuclear fuel processing and storage, then sooner or later, the country will
have to reconsider its entire nuclear energy policy, which would eventually impact
national energy decarbonization goals through 2050.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / BESS
PV module manufacturer Trina Solar has applied for a 660 MW/ 2.64 GWh battery
energy storage system in Western Australia. If approved, the 4-hour duration BESS
would be at the Kemerton Strategic Industrial Area that’s designated as a state-
priority project, intended for strategic and heavy industries in the South-West.

China / Carbon market
China seeks feedback on a plan to include cement, steel and aluminium production in
its carbon emissions trading scheme by year’s end, hoping this will boost market
liquidity. China's carbon market consists of a mandatory ETS and a voluntary GHG
emissions reduction trading market known as the China Certified Emission Reduction
scheme.

China / Energy transition
Global clean energy investments have increased rapidly over the past decade, rising
from $248 billion in 2014 to $745 billion in 2023, reports Rystad Energy. During this
time, China has deployed more clean energy technologies than all other countries
combined.

Coal power
A G7 plan to shut coal power plants in emerging markets faces further delays after a
July deadline passed without a deal on the early closure of an Indonesian power plant
that would be the first targeted under the Just Energy Transition Partnerships, which
calls to invest billions of dollars in Indonesia, South Africa, Vietnam, etc to help in the
energy transition.

India / Solar power
Spain’s Zelestra secured $147 million in financing for its 435 MW Gorbea solar plant in
Rajasthan state. Currently, Zelestra India has 1.5 GW of projects in operation,
construction, signed, or awarded, with a total portfolio of almost 5 GW.

Indonesia / Green financing
The Asian Development Bank approved a $500 million policy-based loan to expedite
Indonesia's energy transition towards sustainable sources. The country’s goal is to
reach net zero power emissions by 2050.

Lithium supply
With EV demand growth slower than anticipated, demand for lithium – an essential
component in batteries – is slowly just as significant investment in new supply bears
fruit. WoodMacEnzie forecasts a surplus of 220,000 tons of lithium carbonate
equivalent in 2024, almost doubling to 436,000 tons in 2026.

Natural gas
U.S. natural gas futures rose 7% to a 12-week high on worries that some Gulf Coast oil
and gas producers would reduce output ahead of a hurricane this week.

Solar power
This year the global community is on track to install 593 GW of solar power, a 29% rise
YoY, reported Ember. China already has the largest solar capacity and leads the world
with new additions for January-July 2024, 28% higher YoY.

South Korea / Nuclear power
The SMART100 small modular reactor design was granted standard design approval
by South Korea's Nuclear Safety and Security Commission. SMART100 (System-
integrated Modular Advanced Reactor 100) is an advanced version of the original
SMART design that became the world's first SMR to receive approval in 2012.
