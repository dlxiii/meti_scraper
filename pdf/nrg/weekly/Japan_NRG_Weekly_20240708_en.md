NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





GX Promotion Organization launched, will drive ¥150 trillion into energy transition

(Government statement, July 1)
•  The GX Promotion Organization, which was established on May 15 to execute the GX Promotion
Act, became operational on July 1. Its roles include:
o  Drive ¥150 trillion worth of energy transition investments from the public and private
sectors to realize carbon neutrality in 2050;
o  Guarantee debts of private businesses engaged in the energy transition;
o  Buy corporate bonds of businesses engaged in transition projects;
o  Run the emissions trading and carbon pricing systems;

o  Collect charges levied on fossil fuels starting in 2028;
o  Conduct research and advise METI, etc.
•  The organization will be the social infrastructure essential for Japan to win the global competition
for decarbonization, PM Kishida said.
•  CONTEXT: The METI minister makes decisions on the amount of fossil fuel charges, emission
allowances, emission allowance auction details, etc. The Promotion Organization runs day to day

operations including fossil fuel charge collection.
• TAKEAWAY: The Organization is starting with about 40 staff to manage a ¥100 billion fund. The amount will
grow and so will the organization. Until its launch, govt offices received inquiries from municipalities and
businesses if there were ways to make use of subsidies for nuclear and other energy projects to decarbonize, a
state official told Japan NRG. METI hopes the organization will strengthen financing of high-risk transition
projects.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
KHI invests in GX Promotion Organization
(Company statement, July 2)
o  Kawasaki Heavy Industries invested an undisclosed amount in the GX Promotion

Organization, seeking to help realize the mission to drive the green transformation.
o  Its clean energy focus is hydrogen and carbon capture.
o  On July 3, KHI reported accounting frauds over Ministry of Defense contracts, and the
Ministry launched a probe. The incident appears to be irrelevant to METI.
• TAKEAWAY: The GX Promotion Organization has the right to seek private sector shareholders as stated in
Article 28 of the GX Promotion Act. However, the Act does not elaborate on how conflicts of interests among

business stakeholders are prevented.

ANRE to attract more nuclear businesses into Aomori Pref to build local supply chain
(Government statement, July 1)
•  ANRE proposed to attract nuclear components makers and maintenance service providers to
Aomori Pref to build a local nuclear supply chain that’s integrated with fuel reprocessing, storage

and power generation facilities.
•  Aomori has facilities but they’re not well linked with the local economy since companies involved in
the nuclear supply chain are not located there.
•  The proposal was made during a dialog between ANRE and the municipalities. Aomori Governor
Miyashita expressed support for ANRE’s plan.
•  CONTEXT: On July 2, a series of public briefings about the fuel storage facility began. The project
requires a safety agreement between the prefecture, Mutsu City, and the Recycled Fuel Storage

Company (RFS). Public opinion plays an important role in forming this agreement. Attendees
included Aomori Governor, national government and prefectural officials, and representatives from
RFS.

Aomori’s nuclear facilities:
Municipality Nuclear facilities (operator)
Rokkasho Village Fuel reprocessing plant (Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd), Rokkasho Fusion Institute (Japan
Atomic Energy Agency)

Mutsu City Interim fuel storage (Recyclable Fuel Storage Co)
Oma Township Nuclear power plant (J-Power)
Higashidori Nuclear power plant (Tohoku Electric)
Village




Kishida proposes steps to drive Asia-wide zero emission initiatives
(Government statement, July 5)
•  PM Kishida proposed three steps to drive energy transition initiatives among the Asia Zero
Emission Community members, which are:
o  To advance emission cuts in power, transport and industrial sector, launch sector-specific

collaboration framework;
o  To establish Asia Zero Emission Center in Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and
East Asia (ERIA), the “Asian OECD”;
o  To create cross border decarbonization rules and infrastructure.
•  In the AZEC ministerial meeting in Laos this autumn, Kishida hopes for an agreement on specific
net zero action policies for the next 10 years.
•  CONTEXT: AZEC was formed in March 2023, participated by 9 ASEAN nations, Australia and

Japan.

ITER fusion energy reactor to face 8-year delayed start
(Nikkei, July 4)
•  ITER will face delays of at least eight years, postponing the initial operation of its fusion reactor
from 2025 to 2033. The reason is a problem with components. Costs will rise, bringing total

operating costs to Є25 billion.
•  Cracks were found in the cooling pipes of a thermal shield attached to the outside of the vacuum
vessel. South Korea is responsible for producing the parts.
•  ITER believed it could compensate for the error through welding, but French regulators didn’t
approve.
•  CONTEXT: Located in southern France, ITER is the world's largest experimental nuclear fusion
reactor project. Its seven main partners are: Japan, the EU, the U.S., Russia, South Korea, China,

and India.
• TAKEAWAY: This long delay and cost overrun comes as a major setback for the fusion energy community.
Much hope has been placed on ITER in pioneering innovation and progress in fusion. Sceptics of fusion energy
— and there are many — will feel justified. Also, it’s clear that one strength of ITER — international
cooperation — has turned out to be a weakness. The ITER partners produce the required components at
home, sending them to southern France where they’re assembled. Thus, possible defects are discovered too

late.




New EV sales slump 39%, but EV imports jump 29%
(JADA data, July 4)
•  Japan registered 29,282 EVs sold in January to June, down 39% YoY, according to the Japan
Automobile Dealers Association.
•  Of this number, 10,689 were imports, up 29% YoY.

•  The EVs had a 1.6% share of the new passenger vehicle registration total.
•  In this same period, FCV registration doubled to 442 from 200 in 2023.




Battery Association of Japan proposes lithium ion battery safety rules
(BAJ statement, July 4)
•  The Battery Association of Japan proposed to METI expanding lithium ion battery safety
requirements, such as the use of insulation sheets in battery packs to prevent flammable gas
release and tests measuring performance in pressure variations.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese batteries have only a 14% share of the domestic stationary storage battery

market. The association said stringent safety requirements will boost demand for locally produced
batteries.

ANRE solicits public feedback on proposed LTDA guideline revision
(Government statement, July 2)
•  ANRE is soliciting public feedback on a proposed revision of the Long-term Decarbonization
Power Source Auction (LTDA) guidelines. Feedback is accepted until July 31.
•  Revisions include:

o  Raising the minimum capacity of a power transmission terminal to 30 MW from 10 MW;
o  Adding existing nuclear power compliant to the latest safety guidelines to the stable
power source category;
o  Clarifying the scope of Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission data
gathering.




Central Japan Ammonia Assn members agree on infrastructure plans

(Nikkei, July 2)
•  The members of Central Japan Hydrogen and Ammonia Association agreed on the outline of
ammonia and hydrogen production, storage and transport infrastructure building plans in the
Aichi, Gifu and Mie prefectures.
•  Kinuura port near JERA’s Hekinan power station will be the ammonia import and storage base;
about 1 million tons/ year of ammonia are to be delivered there by 2030.
•  Dehydrogenation and ammonia cracking facilities will be located in the ports of Nagoya and
Mikawa, to retrieve hydrogen from ammonia. The hydrogen will be transported to FC stations and

end users via pipelines and trucks.
•  CONTEXT: The Association consists of JERA, Toyota Motor, the regional METI offices, local
business associations and 12 municipalities. By 2030, it forecasts annual ammonia demand of 1.5
million tons and hydrogen demand of 0.23 million tons.
• TAKEAWAY: JERA alone will likely consume most of the ammonia and its supply chain will be tightly
integrated with the Kinuura port and JERA’s power stations 10 km away. Hydrogen demand is one fifth that of

ammonia but its supply chain will cover a wider area as consumers are more spread out. In the case of central
Japan, hydrogen’s economic performance would likely be lower than ammonia.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
METI decides that Osaka Expo to run on ammonia power

(Government statement, July 5)
o  METI decided to showcase ammonia-coal co-firing at the Osaka Expo next year by using
ammonia-derived power to run the event.
o  The co-firing is positioned as a part of the Green Innovation Fund initiative to deploy
clean energy technologies.




Yamanashi Pref to develop green hydrogen applications for farms
(Government statement, July 2)
•  The Yamanashi Pref govt is exploring the development of green hydrogen applications for farms

that want to replace fossil fuels with carbon-neutral energy.
7



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Governor Nagasaki told the prefectural assembly he was studying a joint R&D scheme with a
humidifier manufacturer.
•  CONTEXT: Yamanashi Pref produces solar-derived green hydrogen and has attracted Kose,
Suntory, and Sumitomo Rubber Industries as users of the Yamanashi P2G (Power to Gas) systems.
Its approach is the complete opposite of Aichi and Yamaguchi prefectures that are building

infrastructure for existing energy players.
• TAKEAWAY: Some say hydrogen’s potential is in local production and consumption, since its transport costs
are high. Presently, Yamanashi delivers its hydrogen to users in Tokyo by truck and one wonders how the cost
of delivery to local farms scattered in mountains will compare with selling in distant Tokyo that has more users.




Idemitsu sets record in ammonia production at room temperatures

(Company statement, July 4)
•  Idemitsu Kosan, together with three research institutes, achieved a world record in ammonia
production at room temperatures and pressure, using molybdenum catalyst.
•  They developed the electrolytic synthesis technology that increased the amount of ammonia
generation per unit area of electrodes by 20 times compared to the Haber-Bosche technology
that’s the present dominant process.
•  Idemitsu, Tokyo University, Osaka University and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial

Science and Technology will continue researching ways to establish cost-competitive mass
production of carbon-free ammonia.
•  CONTEXT: This project has Green Innovation Fund support through FY2028. Nikkei reports that
Idemitsu plans 1,000 tons of domestic ammonia production by 2032.
• TAKEAWAY: Ammonia production at room temperatures, if commercialized, would be a game changer
boosting Japan’s energy self-sufficiency. However, there are challenges. Idemitsu told Japan NRG in 2021 that

the molybdenum-nitrogen-water reaction generates not just ammonia but chemicals that require further
treatment before disposal as industrial waste.




PXP Corp makes tandem PSC cell with 26.5% efficiency
(Company statement, July 2)
•  PXP Corp produced a sample tandem perovskite solar cell (PSC) module sized 4 cm2 with a power

efficiency of up to 26.5%.
•  The tandem module consists of two layers: perovskite and chalcopyrite (copper, indium, gallium
selenium). The double layer boosts power efficiency.
•  PXP aims to increase the cell size to 16 cm2 by March 2025. It is also developing a new perovskite
cell structure to increase resistance against heat.
•  CONTEXT: Tandem PSC is the mainstream technology overseas, and silicon has been used as the
second layer. Japanese developers have avoided silicon because the aim of PSC development has

been to rely less on silicon imports. However, single PSC modules developed by other Japanese
manufacturers have power efficiency of about 15%. PXP claims 40% is possible with a tandem
structured module.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: A power
efficiency of 15% suggests
that the remaining 85% have
been converted into heat and
other energies. PXP is one of

the few Japanese developers
who have recognized the
risky aspect of heat causing
PSC material erosion.
Understanding the heat
mechanism of PSC is
important for user safety.



Tandem PSC module






Tokyo Gas gets clean gas certification for Yokohama e-methane facility
(Company statement, July 1)
•  Tokyo Gas said its synthetic methane (e-methane) production and demo facility in Yokohama
(Kanagawa Pref) was certified under the Clean Gas Certificate program.

•  The facility has the capacity to produce 12.5 nm3 of e-methane/ h. The company is considering
selling the environmental value of the certificates to businesses that want to decarbonize their gas.
•  The e-methane is mostly produced from CO2 derived from exhaust gas generated at a waste plant
in Yokohama, and hydrogen obtained from renewables by electrolysis.
•  This year, the firm also plans to produce e-methane using digestion gas generated at Yokohama
City's sewage center.
•  CONTEXT: The Clean Gas Certificate system was launched in April by the Japan Gas Appliances

Inspection Association. The environmental value of the clean gas produced at certified facilities can
be converted into certificates after authorization.




MOL inks Japan's first sustainability-linked ship lease agreement
(Company statement, July 2)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines’ subsidiary, Singapore-based MOL Chemical Tankers, inked Japan's first
sustainability-linked ship lease (with a purchase option) with Tokyo Century. The chemical tanker
Bonita Ana is equipped with a marine-gas oil-only engine that reduces NOx emissions and lower

CO2 emissions.
•  The deal sets performance targets for GHG emissions, and lease payments are reduced in
accordance with reaching targets.

•  Tokyo Century established Japan's first "Sustainability-Linked Finance and Transition-Linked
Finance Framework" to offer support under a Japanese Operating Lease with Call Option
(JOLCO). This is the first project under the framework.




Govt solicits feedback on expanding wireless applications to power
(Government statement, July 3)
•  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is soliciting public feedback on its policy to

expand commercial use of radio frequency waves to develop wireless power transmission and
other digital markets. Feedback submission closes on Aug 2.
•  CONTEXT: Commercial use of wireless power transmission includes EV chargers and building
power systems.
• TAKEAWAY: Licence fee payments for basic wireless technologies, which have been patented, have been
disputed because users, notably automakers, claimed the fees were too high. Similar issues may be raised
among power users.

Portugal’s EDP plans to invest ¥20 billion in Japan’s renewables market, focus on solar

(Nikkei, July 2)
•  EDP, a major Portuguese renewable energy firm, plans to make a full-scale entry into Japan’s
renewables market, with a ¥20 billion investment by 2026.
•  In 2025, Its subsidiary EDP Renovaveis (EDP Renewables), will launch a large solar power plant with
a 44 MW total capacity in Fukushima City.
•  EDP plans to invest in solar PV and electricity storage in other areas, to develop a total of 200 MW
of solar power generation and other projects. EDP will sell the electricity directly to firms based on

PPAs.
•  In response to protests against large solar projects in Japan, Miguel Fonseca, CEO of EDPR's
APAC division, said the firm will acquire land not prone to natural disasters.
•  CONTEXT: EDP owns 950 MW of renewable energy sources in Asia, including solar power; and
plans to increase this to 5 GW by 2030. Currently, about half of the capacity is generated in
Vietnam; but Hanoi’s policies holding down the price at which power can be sold have prompted
the firm to invest in Japan.

• TAKEAWAY: In the wake of the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, Japan quickly built solar capacity, but that
slowed in 2020. Now the govt is making a push to build clean energy capacity across the board, especially
solar and offshore wind. Japan’s high demand for electricity, its relatively clear regulations — with incentives
and funding schemes such as recently introduced long-term decarbonized power sources auction that
guarantee a long-term fixed revenue —- have helped Japan to boost attractiveness as a renewables market.





TSE designates Enechange as ‘stock under supervision’, might be delisted
(Denki Shimbun, July 1)
•  On June 27, the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that Enechange was designated as a "stock
under supervision” (under review).
•  Enechange revealed that it wouldn’t be able to submit its securities report for the fiscal year by the
deadline of June 28. If the securities report cannot be submitted by July 10, it will be delisted.
•  Enechange said it will submit and disclose the necessary reports as soon as possible.

•  CONTEXT: Enechange received a notice that a SPC that owns EV charging equipment should be
included in the scope of consolidation. Enechange had been working to include the SPC in the
scope of consolidation, but the securities report was not submitted in time.

JPEA estimates potential for solar power at 529 GW by 2050
(Organization statement, July 1)
•  The Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA) released estimates for potential solar power
capacity, on the premise that Japan will see an expansion of EV and BIPV tech, as well as agrisolar

and floating PV projects.
o  125 GW (AC) by 2030
o  173 GW (AC) by 2035
o  400 GW (AC) or 529 (DC) by 2050
•  JPEA said Japan has so far installed only 3.6% of potential total capacity, estimated to be 2.38 TW.
In late 2022, Japan had installed 71 GW (AC) or 87 (DC) of solar power.
•  According to the JPEA, even the projected capacity of 529 GW in 2050 will account for only 22%

of the total potential capacity.
•  The organization says that agriculture offers the most opportunities for growth, with potential
capacity estimated at up to 1.59 TW (DC), followed by commercial buildings at 391 GW.




Japan to support ASEAN power grid development, aims to counter China
(Nikkei, July 1)
•  The Japanese govt will offer financial assistance to companies, including KEPCO, for an inter-island
power transmission project in Indonesia as part of Tokyo's efforts in SE Asia's grid development.
•  KEPCO was tapped to do a study for Indonesia’s state-led project to build the inter-island power

grid. Japan will cover about 50% of the costs.
•  Japan will participate in a cross-regional power grid project, the ASEAN Power Grid (APG), which
began in 1997; but development has stalled, especially in southern areas with remote islands.
•  The govt will also fund a project by Kyudenko, a Kyushu Electric affiliate, which will help bring
renewables to remote islands in Indonesia's North Kalimantan province.
•  CONTEXT: The move is seen as a response to China's interest in SE Asia's energy infrastructure,

promoting its Belt and Road Initiative. In Indonesia in particular, islands suitable for power
generation are located far away from Jakarta and other major cities, and require connection via
subsea cables.




METI: additional measures to improve procurement of tertiary power in balancing market
(Government statement, June 28)
•  An ANRE study group approved additional measures to improve procurement efficiency of the
tertiary adjustment power in the balancing market:
o  Reduction of the amount of solicitation in the day-ahead market and coverage of any

shortfall by utilizing surplus capacity;
o  Giving the right to operate some pumped storage resources to general transmission and
distribution firms.
•  The govt decided to suspend trade shortages of the secondary and tertiary weekly capacities on
the previous day, together with the tertiary weekly capacity.

12



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  On July 1, the govt introduced a plan to reduce the amount of auctioned tertiary capacity using a
formula with the capacity multiplied by a reduction factor calculated based on past procurement
rates.
•  According to ANRE, the measure has helped increase the average contract rate to 34.3% in April;
and it exceeded 90% by mid-June.
•  The effect of the reduction was also reflected in procurement costs, with the daily total for the nine

utilities in June dropping 66% compared to May.




The May volume of transactions in the hourly market reached a new high
(Denki Shimbun, July)
•  The average daily volume of transactions in the JEPX hourly market in May increased 24.3% from

TEPCO Unit Pitches Bitcoin Mining as a Way to
Roll Out More Renewables in Japan

The following is a condensed version of a report that was published as part of our
company’s GxxD series, which examines the nexus between decarbonization (GX) and
digitalization (DX) trends in Japan. To read the report in full, please check:
https://www.yuri-group.co.jp/gxxd

Bitcoin mining never quite found a welcome mat in Japan. High electricity costs,
coupled with the volatility of cryptocurrencies and concern about its environmental
impact, mean that there’s a negligible amount of Bitcoin mining in Japan. That might
soon change.

Agile Energy X, a TEPCO Power Grid unit that transports about a third of Japan’s
electricity, claims that Bitcoin mining can spur a new boom in renewables. The firm is
moving ahead with a Proof of Concept (PoC) model that will see Bitcoin mining create
the kind of flexible electricity consumer that can help solar and wind projects solve
their grid access problems.


The timing is fortuitous. Since spring 2024, Bitcoin’s price has risen and many fans see
a new bull run due to a technical event known as ‘halving’. To capitalize, Agile Energy
X wants to install a nationwide distributed computing network capable of monetizing
excess renewable energy via Bitcoin mining.

This network would soak up electricity from the hundreds of solar farms that get
curtailed when the system has excess power generation. The plan would give solar
operators a new income stream; the grid would find a flexible offtaker to help it
balance; and Agile Energy X would monetize green electricity that otherwise would be
wasted. With fewer grid chokepoints, there would be more incentive to invest in new
renewables capacity.

Agile Energy X says this approach can be more efficient than batteries or hydrogen as
a way to mop up and store surplus power. It would also be cheaper and easier to
handle than existing energy management systems. But will the government support
the arrangement?

“A lot of people see Bitcoin mining as a waste of electricity. But we took the opposite
approach. We combined Bitcoin mining, which consumes a large amount of
electricity, with renewable energy, which is often wasted. This introduces a far more
profitable use of renewable energy.”
- Agile Energy X CEO, Tateiwa Kenji


Tacit government approval
Agile Energy X’s approach has already attracted government interest. METI set up a
study group to develop a trading market for distributed energy and Minister for

Digital Transformation Kono Taro has inquired about the potential to apply Agile
Energy X’s technology to renewables other than solar and wind.

Bitcoin mining is energy intensive and, if a country, it would be the world’s 24th
biggest consumer of electricity at 170.5 Terawatt hours (TWh) a year, slightly less than
Egypt and more than Poland. It also emits 86.4 metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MtCO2e) of greenhouse gasses a year, less than Morocco and slightly
more than Israel.

Japan accounts for 0.23% of the global amount of computing power employed by
Bitcoin miners on the blockchain. That compares to 21.11% in China and 37.84% in
the U.S. (China banned crypto trading and mining in 2021, but clearly not everyone
got the memo.)

Curtailment and congestion
Jump-started by the world’s most lucrative tariff for renewables, solar generation
capacity rose from a negligible amount to over 72 GW in just about a decade, making
Japan the world’s No. 3 in terms of installations.

But the solar boom has come unstuck due to the lagging update of Japan’s energy
infrastructure. Local and regional grid operators now struggle to accommodate the
large volume of smaller, intermittent, and distributed power sources alongside large
thermal power plants. The two main issues for the grid are congestion and
curtailment.


Curtailment is the act of shutting down a power source at times of oversupply. In
theory, clean energy options and especially renewables are supposed to be prioritized
when the grid operator decides on which power plants should temporarily close. In
practice, flipping the on-off switch on older, large thermal power plants is impractical.
Nuclear reactor operations, for example, are planned months in advance.

Thus, it’s the most flexible power sources, such as solar and wind, that get temporarily
cut off from the grid. The panels still absorb sunlight and the turbines still turn, but it’s
not converted into electricity. Particularly in spring when demand is low, solar power
suffers high levels of curtailment. Electricity generation via solar reaches a peak during
daytime, causing repeated temporary surpluses. This waste of energy is a cost burden
for solar farms, and can impact investment decisions.

The waste is huge. Japan ‘lost’ a record 1.92 TWh in renewable energy to curtailment
in 2023. Kyushu, the area most suited to solar energy generation, sees the largest
levels of curtailment nationally.

Congestion occurs due to issues with grid configuration or equipment performance.
Transmission lines sometimes struggle to transport electricity from a particular
supplier to a buyer due to overheating or a loss of system stability. The transmission
operator may then advise the supplier to limit their dispatch levels, obstructing the
transmission of electricity to a willing buyer, which can then lead to increased costs for
the consumer.

Think different
Agile Energy X tackles both issues with reverse logic. Rather than reducing power
supply at source (i.e. curtailment), it proposes boosting demand at the user end
through installation of Bitcoin mining operations at critical grid points. As a self-styled
"solutions integrator" and supplier of both the operating system and mining sites and
rigs, the company would control this network of Bitcoin mines using distributed
computing technology.

Problem 1: Financial losses from renewable energy curtailment
Solution: Waste renewable energy powers crypto mining, producing Bitcoin

•  Mining rigs installed within vicinity of a renewables facility
•  Excess energy is directed to Bitcoin mining
•  The higher the market price of Bitcoin, the greater the reward
•  Portion of this revenue is returned to local governments for use in
decarbonized town development, etc


Problem 2: Higher consumer costs caused by grid congestion
Solution: Mining creates flexible demand, consuming excess energy anytime and
anywhere at points of oversupply

1. Distribution lines deliver power to mining rigs at point of congestion
2. Pressure valve mechanism of distributed mining operations manages supply
and demand
3. Consumption of excess electricity for Bitcoin mining reduces losses, lowering
costs for power firms
4. Unrelated to Bitcoin market price

The business case
Demand for a solution is growing with each year. OCCTO predicts that renewable
energy could account for 50-60% of Japan’s power mix by 2050. If that proves correct,
Agile Energy X anticipates that under existing infrastructure, there’d be a renewable
energy surplus of 240 TWh per year.

Considering renewable Bitcoin mining operations in the U.S., Agile Energy X believes
it could direct 10% of that surplus energy to Bitcoin mining. Earning around ¥15/ kWh
in mining rewards, depending on the price of Bitcoin, the operation could generate
revenue of ¥360 billion per year.

The company has yet to calculate total costs, but it argues they should be considered
part of the ¥6-7 trillion needed to optimize the grid for the 50-60% share of the
energy mix that renewables would occupy by 2050.


From concept to company
Agile Energy X launched in 2020 as the so-called MegaWatt To MegaHash project at
TEPCO Power Grid offices and was spun off as a company in 2022. Since then, it has
gradually increased the overload capacity of its mining rigs. With the introduction of
distributed computing technology controlled using Triple-1 semiconductors, the
advanced stages of the PoC process demonstrate an increased ability to flexibly
monitor and manage grid capacity through remote Bitcoin mining operations.
20

Additionally, Agile Energy’s latest PoC demonstrations confirm a capacity to convert
heat and CO2 emissions from mining into additional green value, such as carbon
capture and aquaponics, which further reduces Bitcoin mining’s environmental
impact .

June 2022 to March 2024 – TEPCO Power Grid, Kisarazu Branch
•  About 1,300 mining devices deployed in seven portable shipping containers,
•  Confirmed impact on the grid of a 1.5 MW overload countermeasure system,
•  Demonstrated the possibility for remote control, monitoring, and
management.

August 2023 to present – TEPCO Renewable Power solar panel plant, Showa Village,
Gunma Prefecture (50 kw)
•  Containerized data center fitted with Bitcoin mining devices,

•  Demonstrated possibility of monitoring solar power generation in real time +
load capacity of Bitcoin mining equipment,
•  Through automatic control, demonstrated the ability to use the solar power
without it flowing back into the grid.

Implications
Should the startup succeed and help to ease congestion and curtailment, it would
create an additional incentive to invest in solar and wind farm operators, and create a
backup client to the current PPAs / market-trading / FIT or FIP revenue channels.

The ‘side effect’ is that the new system would encourage greater adoption of digital
currencies such as Bitcoin. However, developments in the global financial system
suggest this is already happening. Net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs stand at $13 billion in
just four months since such investment instruments were introduced.

CEO Tateiwa says billions of dollars are needed to build a national Bitcoin mining
network with the kind of load bearing capacity he envisages for Agile Energy X. A
stable national system – such as a distributed energy market, still in the embryonic
stages – is also a necessary precursor to monetize the rewards obtained by ‘digi-
green’ mining.

If Japan can overcome its aversion to Bitcoin mining, there’s digital gold aplenty
waiting to be accessed. Tateiwa: “Once people come around to the idea that Bitcoin
mining, this power guzzler, can be used to solve energy issues, it becomes an ‘Aha!’
moment. Those people are increasing by the day.”

ANALYSIS

BY ANDREW STATTER
Energy Jobs in Japan: Investing in Education

Often we have written about the shortage of talent across various growth segments of
the energy sector. This is a global challenge, with LinkedIn sharing in a report that the
increase in job postings requiring at least one green skill was 22.4% in 2023,
compared to a 12.3% increase in talent with said skills.

In Japan, the challenge is compounded by language barriers, and low mobility of
talent compared to European markets. At the micro level, we can solve talent
shortage issues for individual companies by headhunting experienced talent. This has
various implications on the wider industry, companies and professionals including:
•  Vicious competition for talent;
•  Increased cost of hire for experienced professionals;
•  Challenges for firms to avoid having employees poached by competitors.

When we zoom out and look at the wider industry, and look beyond the immediate
needs and then project forward, it becomes clear that much wider, systematic change
is required.


Rate of demand will continue to grow
Over the past decades, skills directly related to renewable energy deployment have
grown steadily in Japan. Engineers, construction managers, project managers and
finance professionals have been moving from other industries into the renewables
space as Japan has boosted its renewable energy capacity from nearly zero in 2011 to
over 65 GW today.

As Japan plans to increase the share of renewable power in the energy mix from
today’s 22% to 36~38% by 2030, this growth will accelerate. Beyond renewables
though, the demand for ‘green talent’ is expanding with increased complexity in our
energy mix; and as energy related business seeps into wider industries new skill needs
are created.

Some notable areas of growth include:
•  Carbon and GHG accounting;
•  Energy procurement and energy efficiency planning;
•  Supply chain management and Scope 2 & 3 emissions measurement;
•  Data science and machine learning operations;
•  R&D and manufacturing of cutting edge technologies.

Educate the next generation
METI has taken steps to invest into the next generation of young Japanese coming
through the university system. In June of this year, METI announced that offshore wind
power generation will be added into the National Institute of Technology (KOSEN)’s
COMPASS 5.0 initiative.


The goal is to set up a new curriculum for ‘next generation core technology education’
that includes battery technologies, AI, semiconductors, data science, among others.
22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

METI has also established the Education Council for Offshore Wind (ECOWIND) which
is a group of Japanese power generation and EPC companies, as well as key
educational institutions.

Japan’s education system for clean energy and sustainability has lagged compared to
other advanced global peers; this has resulted in many Japanese professionals
seeking higher education from overseas educational institutions. This seems to be
changing, however. One of the nation’s leading university preparation schools, J-
PREP, is significantly investing into and developing research papers, educational
materials focused on energy, as well as energy systems to give high school students a
strong foundation early on.

Green reskilling
Better university education is great, but we need people now – cries the industry! As
automation, artificial intelligence and other technologies continue to mitigate labor
demand in certain sectors or even make jobs redundant, there is a need to reskill mid-
career professionals into new areas.

Nagasaki Ocean Academy (NOA) is one of the pioneering institutions for ocean
energy, and it predicts that the demand for engineers and technicians will rise from
the current 2,000 to over 8,600 by 2030, especially as the Round 1, 2 & 3 offshore
wind projects come online. NOA provides various courses on project management,
development, HSE etc. including on site programs.

Green Talent Hub, a startup that focuses on green reskilling business, runs programs
for mid-career professionals, leveraging experts from industry and academia focused
on various topics such as carbon management, renewable energy development,
decarbonisation and more.


These are positive steps, but the challenge is speed and scalability as these are
smaller, industry specialized players offering solutions. Japan will need to see more
mainstream educational institutions developing postgraduate programs.

Industry driven investment
The energy industry seems to be in a comparable situation to the software
engineering boom of the early 2000s. At that time, companies fought over the little
talent available by offering higher salaries, free relocation, increasingly attractive
fringe benefits and long-term incentives.

As in the Japanese energy industry today, this only served the software companies
with the will and resources to attract experienced talent. But it failed to solve the
underlying shortage. As a natural evolution, companies started to hire less
experienced talent, footing the bill for their training, education and also creating in-
house apprenticeship style programs.

In Japan, global firms can leverage their overseas expertise to educate and train local
talent, potentially setting up local or regional centers of excellence. On the other
hand, Japanese firms facing the same challenges can look to the global marketplace
to hire experienced talent, and invest time and money into supporting their language

education to allow qualified, highly skilled foreign workers to operate smoothly in
Japan.

Both require Japan to be an attractive place to work in the long-term; however with a
weak yen and increasing number of young Japanese looking to work abroad, this is a
bigger challenge and a topic for another day.

In summary: Invest for the future
The current supply demand challenge in the talent market for energy or green skills is
but a symptom of a larger, underlying and systemic issue.

Without focused investment in education and skills development from all levels of
industry, academia and government, Japan’s skill gap is only going to increase.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Asia / Oil imports
Asia's imports of crude oil were lower in the first half of 2024 over the same period
last year. Asia imported 27.16 mbpd of crude in the January to June period, down
130,000 bpd from the 27.29 mbpd in the same period in 2023, according to LSEG Oil
Research.

Australia / Oil and gas
Saudi Aramco and ADNOC are separately considering bids for Santos, which has oil
and gas assets stretching across Australia to Alaska. The company produced 91.7
mmboe last year and had proven reserves of 1,661 mmboe.

China / Oil and gas
China set up an entity to search for ultra-deep oil and gas reserves and hard-to-extract
non-conventional resources. In addition to CNPC and Sinopec, the partners in the
new entity include China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, steel group Baowu,
equipment builder Sinomach, etc.

China / Renewables curtailment
China appears to have stopped publishing data that highlight the extent to which
power generated by solar and wind plants is wasted due to constrained grids. Beijing
already changed its rules to allow renewable power plants to have as much as 10% of
generation curtailed, compared with a previous 5% cap.

China / SAF
The Civil Aviation Authority launched China’s first technical center for sustainable
aviation fuel (SAF) that focuses on standard setting and product research. China is the
world's second-largest aviation market, consuming about 11% of jet fuel globally.

India / Coal
India asked power companies to order equipment worth $33 billion this year to fast
track capacity additions of coal-fired power in the years ahead. The country is
struggling to meet booming electricity demand.

India / Nuclear power
Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh said India’s nuclear power generation capacity will increase
70% in the next five years. India’s installed capacity is now at 7.5 GW and will grow to
13 GW by 2029 with the addition of seven new reactors.

India / Solar power
The Asian Development Bank and ENGIE India inked a long-term loan to build and
operate a 400 MW solar farm in Gujarat state. The ADB is the lead arranger for the
$176 mln loan, which will be equally funded by ADB and Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank.

Philippines / Coal
The Philippines was ranked as SE Asia’s most coal-dependent country in 2023,
surpassing Indonesia in percentage. The country saw a sharp 2.9 percentage point
annual coal share increase, from 59.1% in 2022 to 61.9% in 2023, an Ember report
said.

Philippines / Renewable energy
The Philippines’ renewable energy market will see annual growth of 22.6% through
2029, driven by the elimination of the requirement for energy assets to be solely
owned by Filipinos. The govt also approved incentives to attract investment, including
tax holidays, duty-free equipment imports, etc. The country aims for 35% renewable
energy in the national power mix by 2030, increasing to 50% by 2040.
