Panasonic to invest $5 bln in EV battery facility in the U.S., seeks growth beyond Tesla

(Nikkei Asia, April 18)
•  Panasonic Holdings will invest $5 billion to expand EV battery production capacity in the U.S. The
company inked a deal with the State of Oklahoma for incentives.
•  Panasonic has a 7.3% global share of EV batteries and ranked fourth in 2022. With Tesla, in 2017 it
began EV battery production in the U.S., with 40 GWh of capacity. In 2018, the company built a
plant in Kansas, investing $4 billion for 30 GWh of capacity.
•  Panasonic is considering either to expand the existing factories or build a new one – and no

decision has been finalized. Kansas offered $800 million in subsidies over a decade, and
Oklahoma’s incentive package is $700 million.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Panasonic to supply lithium-ion battery cells to Hexagon Purus in the U.S. starting 2026
(Company statement, April 18)
o  Panasonic Energy agreed with Hexagon Purus Systems to supply lithium-ion battery cells
to be used for the company’s proprietary battery systems.
o  Panasonic will produce the battery cells in a new facility in Kansas and benefit from the

Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives. Hexagon Purus will prepay $43 million through 2025.
Panasonic will start supplying the cells in early 2026. This prepayment secures Hexagon
battery cell capacity in the U.S.
• TAKEAWAY: Panasonic ships most of its EV batteries to Tesla. As production in the U.S. expands, the company
needs new clients, for example, Hexagon Purus. The EV market is expected to grow rapidly, despite a
speculative shortage anticipated in lithium supply.



Report says Honda will develop perovskite solar cells; but company has no comment

(Asahi Shimbun, Japan NRG, April 18)
•  Honda Motor group is developing perovskite solar cells (PSC), aiming for their practical application
by 2030.
•  Honda declined to confirm or deny the newspaper report.
• TAKEAWAY: The PSC industry has been very quiet and uneasy about sharing too much information at this
point. Honda’s attitude may reflect the need for more time to explore PSC’s potential and challenges. What’s
more, Honda has some bad experience in this field. The company previously had to close Honda Soltec, a
maker of copper-indium-selenium-gallium (CIGS) solar cells, which promised to be more a more reliable tech

for solar energy than silicon.

ANRE sets up panel to reform METI’s renewable operators data access policy
(Japan NRG, April 17)
•  Following data breaches by EPCO staff, ANRE set up a four-member panel to reform management
policy of renewable operators’ databases run by METI. This panel is separate from the others

discussing EPCO’s unauthorized access of outside customer data.
•  The Digital Agency joins the panel as an observer.
•  ANRE told the panel that EPCO power transmission staff had access to 100 out of 400 data series,
which included privacy data of renewable operator managers. The EPCO staff were passing the
data to the retail arms of their group.
•  One set of ID and password were issued to one EPCO that was shared by up to 50 people. The
EGC suggested METI to review ID and password policies.

•  CONTEXT: The panel purpose is heightening the data security of METI’s renewable operators’
database rather than improving the regulatory systems. The panel members are data security
experts rather than power market experts.
• TAKEAWAY: Panel members agreed that the measures must go beyond EGC recommendations. A deeper
probe is needed and the panel urged ANRE and METI for more data disclosure. Panelist Maruyama Mitsuhiko
pointed out that METI’s ID/password policy possibly violates the govt-wide cyber security rule and that other

METI systems need to be checked.


IGES: G7 businesses must join G7 discussion on circular economy

(IGES statement, April 19)
•  One highlight of the G7 Climate Ministers meeting was the agreement to promote circular
economy and resource efficiency principles, said the Kanagawa-based Institute for Global
Environment Strategies (IGES), a govt think tank.
•  The agreement, proposed by Japan, urges businesses to voluntarily set circular economy criterias
and to build resource-efficient business cycles.
•  Next is to step up collaborations among the Business 7 (B7) Engagement Group consisting of the

Japan Business Federation (Keidanren), the chambers of commerce in the U.S. and Canada, and
major business federations in the EU, and other stakeholders.
•  A new govt-private-academia partnership to be set up by METI are expected to drive the
initiatives.


G7 Ministers support IAEA’s green light for discharge of treated water at Fukushima site

(Denki Shimbun, April 18)
•  On April 16, the G7 Ministers’ Meeting on Climate, Energy and Environment issued a statement to
support the IAEA’s safety report regarding the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) treated
water discharge.
•  The original draft said “We welcome the steady progress of decommissioning at the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi NPP including the discharge of ALPS-treated water, which is consistent with IAEA safety

standards and international law”; but the final version was softened.
•  Not everyone was on board. The German Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and
Nuclear Safety Steffi Lemke said after the meeting that “While Germany appreciates Japan’s effort

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

in handling the Fukushima nuclear accident, we cannot welcome the discharge of ALPS-treated
water”.
• TAKEAWAY: A statement by the G7 Climate Energy and Environment Meeting supporting the ALPS-treated
water release is very important for Japan. TEPCO can now adhere to the release schedule this summer. Still, it
is unlikely that the action will avoid some criticism globally. Outside the G7, China has regularly expressed its

concerned about the water release.


GX bills discussed by the Diet

(Denki Shimbun, April 19 and 20)
•  On April 18, the “GX Promotion Bill” was discussed at the Committee on Economy, Trade and
Industry in the House of Councillors.
•  In the House of Representatives on April 19, the GX Decarbonized Power Source Bill was discussed
by a joint examination of committees combining: ①The Committee of Economy Trade and
Industry; ②The Committee of Environment; and ③The Committee of Nuclear Issues. Some Diet

Members accused the NRA of making rash decisions. However, NRA Chairman Yamanaka Shinsuke
replied that diversity of voices shows the independence and transparency of NRA members.
•  One Constitutional Democratic Party member said that the extension of operating years for nuclear
reactors might lead to safety issues. NRA Chair Yamanaka replied there’s no scientific basis for the
60-year limit.
• TAKEAWAY: Additional questions were asked by Diet members, but most were superficial, such as “How many
years can be excluded from calculating total operation for Ikata Unit 3?” This can be easily calculated from the

years of forced stoppage by the NRA. GX related bills are expected to be passed next month.


Toyota CEO vows to cut emissions by more than half by 2035

(Nikkei, April 21)
•  Toyota Motor’s new CEO Koji Sato promised to cut the CO2 per car sold around the world by
more than 50% (compared to 2019 levels) by 2035.
•  Toyota will maintain a diverse range of vehicle options including EVs, plug-in HVs and fuel cell
vehicles.
•  Toyota’s CO2 reduction goal is based on the "Well-to-Wheel" standards, which means including
the emissions associated with the electricity used by the cars. Since some of the power currently

comes from fossil fuel generation, Toyota vows to support societal moves to speed up the rollout
of renewable energy.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toyota to invest $334 mln to make compact biofuel hybrids in Brazil
(Nikkei Asia, April 19)
o  Toyota Motor plans to invest $334 million to produce compact hybrid vehicles fueled by
gasoline and bioethanol. Currently, Toyota offers Corolla compact flexible fuel hybrid

models and plans to expand to other series.
o  The Sorocaba plant in Sao Paulo will make the hybrids. Sales start in 2024.

INPEX, Mitsui, JOGMEC and ADNOC to study GHG footprint of ammonia
(Company statement, April 18)
•  INPEX, Mitsui, JOGMEC and ADNOC agreed to study the GHG footprints of the latter’s ammonia
projects in Abu Dhabi. The agreement was signed at the sideline of the G7 Climate Ministers
Meeting last week.
•  The goal is to establish GHG measurement methods of ammonia production using hydrogen

generated from fossil fuels, and discover requirements for long-term carbon storage at onshore oil
fields.
•  CONTEXT: Hydrogen and ammonia are at the core of the UAE’s energy strategy, aiming to take a
25% share of the global hydrogen supplies. Ruwais and Kizap are the country’s major ammonia
production sites, not Abu Dhabi.
• TAKEAWAY: ADNOC’s CEO Al Jaber is chairman of COP28 to be held in the UAE; it’s expected that he’ll take
every opportunity to push hydrogen, ammonia and renewables projects but remain committed to increasing

his country’s oil and LNG output.


Mitsui O.S.K. Lines to corporate with U.S. ammonia startup to develop vessel

(Denki Shimbun, April 20)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines will cooperate with U.S. ammonia startup Amogy to develop ammonia
powered generation technology, targeted for vessel usage. The parties aim to have an ammonia-
fueled vessel operate as soon as in 2024.

transportation sector.


Kawasaki Heavy and the UAE’s ADNOC to develop liquid hydrogen supply chains

(Company statement, April 17)
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries agreed with Abu-Dhabi-based ADNOC to explore opportunities to set
up a liquefied hydrogen supply chain.
•  The companies will explore opportunities in the production of hydrogen, hydrogen liquefaction
and associated infrastructure, and maritime transportation of hydrogen to potential offtakers to set
up a commercial-scale international hydrogen supply chain.
•  CONTEXT: Kawasaki is just the latest of a number of Japanese companies partnering with

ADNOC. In early 2023, ADNOC cemented ties with INPEX in clean energy; also, ADNOC’s Abu
Dhabi Chemicals Derivatives inked a deal with trading house Mitsui to develop a low-carbon
ammonia production facility at the TA’ZIZ Industrial Chemicals Zone in Abu Dhabi. Other hydrogen
and ammonia deals between ADNOC and Japanese companies were signed in 2022.



PAJ asks govt for more hydrogen cost reduction and support to counter U.S. incentives

(Nikkan Kogyo, April 18)
•  The Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ) agrees with the govt’s plan to revise its hydrogen
strategy and invest ¥15 trillion to help realize an annual supply target of 12 million tons by 2040,
six times the current level.
•  However, the association chairman Kito Shunichi (president of Idemitsu) also called for large-scale
support in order for hydrogen to bridge the price gap with other fuels.
•  Kito said the U.S. is investing ¥50 trillion in clean energy under the Inflation-Reduction Act; if that

continues, doing business in the U.S. rather than Japan will be more attractive.
• TAKEAWAY: The EU noted several times that the IRA made the U.S. more attractive for businesses involved in
clean energy and rolled out its own set of measures to prevent companies from moving production away from
Europe. PAJ comments seek to make a similar point. Japan has many clean energy programs in place, but the
headline GX vision has yet to secure the funding PM Kishida’s government claims will be necessary to execute
an energy transition in Japan.

EGC issues improvement advisory to EPCOs on unauthorized data access
(Government Statement, April 17)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) issued improvement advisories to
Tohoku Electric, Tohoku Electric Power Network, Chubu Electric Power Grid, Chubu Electric Power

Miraiz, Chugoku Electric and Shikoku Electric following their unauthorized access to customer data
of operators outside their groups.
•  The EGC asked the companies to file plans addressing data access control and compliance
measures by May 12. METI will also conduct follow-up checks.
•  The EGC also itemized effective measures that include risk management, integrity, IT governance
and monitoring.
•  CONTEXT: The response by EPCOs (former power monopolies) has been varied with the regulator

believing that some companies are taking it less seriously than others.
• TAKEAWAY: In theory, an advisory can be ignored, and is less authoritative than an order. Moreover, under
the current regulatory mechanism, the EGC does not have the capacity to issue orders. In practice, an order
can be challenged, while an advisory cannot. Also, due to public pressure and media scrutiny, companies
cannot simply ignore the issue. So, in effect, while the system seems “soft”, it can still achieve results. Making
EPCOs disclose their compliance plans may effectively correct their behavior.

•  Eurus Energy held a Shinto ceremony for safe decommissioning of two wind farms in Aomori.
Eurus Iwaya Wind Farm launched in November 2001 with 32.5 MW capacity, having installed 1.3

MW x 25 Siemens turbines. Eurus Shitsukari Wind Farm 19.25 MW began in October 2003, with
1.75 MW x 11 Vestas turbines.
•  After 20 years of operations, both wind farms ceased operations in March 2023 and demolished
the facilities. Eurus Energy will consider how to utilize the empty sites.



Daiwa House converts coal-fired power station to biomass

(Company statement, April 17)
•  Daiwa House acquired the managing rights of Hibikinada Thermal Power Station (Kitakyushu,
Fukuoka Pref) in January 2023 and plans to convert it into a 100% biomass generation plant by
2026.
•  Hibikinada Station (112 MW) has implemented co-firing (coal 70%; wood pellets 30%) since
December. 2019. This cuts emissions by 30% compared to only burning coal.
•  Daiwa House will modify existing equipment and storage buildings to make them suitable for

biomass.


Japan Marine United received approval for medium-sized SEP vessel
(Company statement, April 14)
•  Japan Marine United (JMU), Nihon Shipyard (NSY), and Toa Corp got approval in principle (AiP) to

convert medium-sized self-elevated platform (SEP) vessels for large wind turbine installation on
semi-sub floaters and service ports.
•  This design allows construction of floating wind facilities at the base port where there is less tidal
and wave impact. Quay reinforcement or land-based cranes aren’t needed.
•  This project was financed by the Green Innovation Fund.
• TAKEAWAY: As Japan plans more offshore wind farms, demand for SEP vessels will grow. Major shipbuilding
companies are involved in their development. The seas surrounding Japan are known for strong tides and

currents, and adopting Japanese technology should help wind farm construction.

OCCTO’s grid plan shows changing direction of Japan’s energy mix

Japan’s next edition of its Basic Energy Plan is not due until next year, but a glimpse
into how the nation’s power mix is likely to change can be seen in a recent document
submitted by OCCTO, the grid oversight entity.

According to OCCTO’s 2050 “masterplan”, the country needs to modernize its power
system to allow large volumes of electricity from mostly renewable sources to move
quickly from major production hubs to places of high demand.

The document paints a vision in which the proliferation of solar (260 GW target) and
wind (86 GW target) power generation is underpinned by investment in High Voltage
Direct Current (HDVC) cables, including underwater, to set a more flexible and
interconnected system.

In some ways, the masterplan is an attempt to put into practical detail the carbon
neutral policy direction of Prime Minister Kishida’s government. It makes room for
scenarios that include electricity generation fueled by hydrogen and ammonia, as well
as carbon capture for thermal stations.

The plan also assumes that nuclear power stays as part of the mix. However, while the
plan’s three scenarios differ in terms of spending and other factors, each has the
renewables capacity component absolutely fixed.

Unlike energy sources, pylons, power cables, and substations rarely attract much
media attention. Yet these items will form the backbone of Japan's power mix in
coming decades. Should OCCTO’s multi-trillion-yen investment plan go ahead, it will
plot the course of energy policies with more certainty than any political
announcement.


Background
Prior to the power industry’s deregulation, regional Electric Power Companies
(EPCOs) were responsible for generating, transmitting, and selling electricity within
their territories. Each of the 10 EPCOs maintained their system independently, and
there was little emphasis on regional grids being connected to each other.

The so-called interconnection power lines (which carry electricity from one regional
grid to another) had limited capacity. The difficulty with moving electricity from one
area to another was exacerbated further by the fact that Japan is one of only two
countries in the world to maintain two electricity frequencies.








17


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

As Japan moved to liberalize the power sector and push EPCOs to unbundle, the
need arose to make the regional grids more connected and flexible. A new entity to
oversee the country’s nationwide power transmission network was established in
2015. And while ostensibly the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of
Transmission Operators (OCCTO) is a private body, it works closely with the
government, and METI in particular, to coordinate nationwide power supply and
demand.

For some years, OCCTO has worked on a plan to revamp Japan’s power grid to
reflect the changing realities since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, which
kickstarted the boom in solar power construction around the country.

In an electricity sector that utilizes more and more variable renewable energy, it was
clear that the ability to move power volumes from sunny and windy Kyushu or windy
Hokkaido and Tohoku to major centers of demand was paramount. The upgrade of
the grid’s infrastructure was also timely as most of the core equipment such as high-
voltage pylons was installed during the economic boom of the 1960s to 1980s.

Still, when OCCTO published its first masterplan for modernization of the power grid
in 2017, it primarily focused on short-term measures to shore up transmission systems,
such as installing new pylons, cables, transformers and pushing for a widening of the
gates that allow the transfer of electricity from one region to another. It also called for
better coordination between EPCOs.


Adding net-zero to the mix
Over the last two years, OCCTO’s proposals have become more ambitious and also
more expensive. In May 2021, it produced an interim report for the masterplan with
several scenarios based on the recently unveiled 2050 net-zero national vision.

In March, OCCTO unveiled the final 139-page "Masterplan for Cross-regional Power
System Operation'' that shifted the focus from security of local supply to a wholesale
upgrade of technical capabilities.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

"Accommodating the growing adoption of renewable energy is an urgent matter to
be addressed; as well as dealing with balancing capacity matters and other issues,”
said OCCTO president Tsutomu Oyama in a company statement. “We’ve taken on
new operations related to the Act on Renewable Energy Special Measures in
accordance with the Act for Establishing Energy Supply Resilience enacted in June
2020. We will focus on these operations while keeping the government’s goals in
mind."

One of top cost items in the plan, which estimates outlays of ¥6 trillion to ¥7.9 trillion,
is the installation of HVDC submarine cables to link major urban areas such as Tokyo
and Osaka with future offshore wind power plants in Hokkaido, Tohoku, etc.

By 2050, the plan sees Japan operating 14 GW of offshore wind power capacity in
Hokkaido and 9 GW in the Tohoku areas, with Tokyo the main recipient of the
volumes. Similarly, 12 GW of offshore wind power in Kyushu could supply green
power to the Kansai area.

Creating the infrastructure to enable long-term transmission is seen as vital to support
a large renewables component, which in turn would bring down the carbon intensity
of the nation’s electricity mix, while also providing resilience for the grid.





















Details on future capacity
The 2023 masterplan splits its proposal to help Japan achieve carbon neutrality by
2050 into three scenarios: the base case; the “demand location guidance” case; and
the “demand location natural” case.

In all three scenarios, power demand and supply are set at the same level, with
renewable energy as the main power source by 2050; these goals are 260 GW of
solar, 41 GW of onshore wind, 45 GW of offshore wind, and 60 GW of hydro,
biomass, and geothermal energy.

The plan does not provide specific output capacities for thermal and nuclear power
but assumes that thermal power plants will operate until the end of their submitted
plans and be replaced with hydrogen or ammonia-based plants. Nuclear reactors are
projected to operate for 60 years.

To enable this, OCCTO advocates for more interconnection capacity, especially
between the east and west of Honshu Island, and to establish stronger transmission
links between north Japan, such as Hokkaido and Tohoku and the central Tokyo area.
The content of the latest OCCTO Master Plan reflects the government’s GX Basic
Policy announced on December 22, 2022.


Beneficiaries
Japan has a strong electrical engineering sector, but domestic firms have not made
major breakthroughs in technologies such as HVDC transmission. However, in 2018,
one of the engineering majors, Hitachi Ltd., made a record investment in the
transmissions business of Zurich-based ABB. Last year, Hitachi took full control of the
grid-focused company that also specializes in HVDC.

There was speculation that METI supported the acquisition since it wanted to see a
Japanese firm obtain engineering and manufacturing capacity for HVDC transmission,
especially for submarine cables linking Hokkaido, Tohoku, and Tokyo.

It’s too early to ascertain which companies will be tasked with upgrading the nation’s
power grid infrastructure. But it’s clear that the business opportunities match if not
exceed those in electricity generation. Pylons and cables may not get the headlines,
but they will certainly generate lucrative contracts.

Can Japan build a domestic offshore wind farm supply chain?

Together with fellow G7 members, Japan has committed itself to a major buildout of
offshore wind power generation. In effect, this means creating a sector almost from
scratch.

While most attention so far has focused on the slow rollout of auctions to decide
which companies will develop offshore wind projects, there’s been one positive result:
allowing time for domestic industry to grasp the policy shift and start planning ways it
can participate in the sector’s burgeoning supply chain. That also instigated a flurry of
partnerships between Japanese and international firms, creating new market players.

The government’s top goals for offshore wind generation are clear: Become a
significant source of energy on a scale that squeezes fossil fuel generation to a
minimum and overtakes domestic nuclear capacity. The initial 10 GW of offshore wind
capacity penciled in for this decade is supposed to precede a much faster rollout in
the 2030s and the 2040s, with a gradual shift to turbines that float in deep water, as
opposed to fixed to the ocean floor.

For these plans and visions to be realized, however, the sector will need to
aggressively cut its costs and one way to do that, according to the government, will
be to create a vibrant and competitive domestic supply chain that would service the
full cycle of wind power generation from environmental assessments to turbine
decommissioning.

We review some of the recent developments in this space.


Market size
In 2019, METI set out the following long-term roadmap for the wind power sector.

Target Year Onshore Wind  Offshore Wind Total Capacity
2030        26.6 GW       9.6 GW        36.2 GW
2040        38 GW         27.9 GW       65.9 GW

2050        38 GW         37 GW         75 GW
Source: METI

In December 2020, METI revised its target for offshore wind capacity to 10 GW by
2030 and 30-45 GW by 2040. The target for 2050 wasn’t specified, but was widely
believed to stay at the 37 GW from the earlier plan.

So far, adding wind capacity both onshore and offshore has been slow going; as of
late 2022, there was a total of 4.6 GW in operation, of which only 0.06 GW was
offshore. This makes the 2030 government target for offshore projects particularly
ambitious.

|  | Target Year |  |  | Onshore Wind |  |  | Offshore Wind |  |  | Total Capacity |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2030 |  |  | 26.6 GW |  |  | 9.6 GW |  |  | 36.2 GW |  |
|  | 2040 |  |  | 38 GW |  |  | 27.9 GW |  |  | 65.9 GW |  |
|  | 2050 |  |  | 38 GW |  |  | 37 GW |  |  | 75 GW |  |

In December 2022, Japan’s first commercial offshore wind power operations kicked
off in the Akita area as Marubeni Corp started feeding electricity from its 140 MW
Noshiro Port project that uses Vestas V117-4.2 MW turbines.


Background
The deep waters off Japan’s coasts pose technological challenges that differ from
some of the other regions where offshore wind power is currently flourishing. Japan’s
four major islands – Hokkaido, Honshu (mainland), Shikoku, and Kyushu – are
surrounded by strong currents and tides. Typhoons regularly visit in late summer and
autumn, bringing an added layer of complexity to both construction and operations.

The initial cost estimate for the first 10 GW was calculated at about ¥5 trillion to ¥6
trillion, according to METI and the Japan Wind Power Association (JWPA) calculations
first released in 2019. Since then, inflation in raw material and construction costs is up
by double digits.

A way to mitigate these costs now and for the future, is to secure more production in
Japan. After all, the cost of wind turbine production accounts for about 24% of the
total offshore wind power project cost.

Japan, however, currently imports most of its wind turbines. Despite efforts to break
into this sector in the last decade, Japanese manufacturers failed to win orders in a
barren domestic market or get traction abroad. Most exited from turbine
manufacturing altogether. Even in the current policy environment, Japanese firms
have responded by forming international partnerships and JVs rather than strike out
on their own.


Complex systems and supply chains
The offshore wind supply chain comprises a wide range of components, including
wind turbines, foundations, substations, and transmission cables. As Japan's offshore
wind capacity expands, the demand for these components is set to rise exponentially,
creating a thriving ecosystem of manufacturers, suppliers, and service providers.

Wind turbines, the most critical component, are particularly complex, consisting of
parts such as nacelles, towers, and rotor blades. The total number of components can
reach 20,000 and include small items like nuts and bolts but also parts that weigh
several tons.

The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) and JWPA stated that their goal
is to domestically source 60% of the components (not just turbines) by 2040. How that
will be accomplished is still not clear.

About a decade ago, and up until the mid to late 2010s, Japan’s main wind turbine
production was led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Hitachi (based on the assets
of Fuji Heavy Industries), and Japan Steel Works. By the mid 2010s, these three firms
supported an ecosystem of over 60 wind component producers across 69 factories,
generating over $1 billion of sales.

Other prominent industry players were Fuji Electric (electric devices), NTN (bearings)
and Ishibashi (gearbox).

However, by 2020 the above ecosystem was devastated. In 2018, MHI touted itself as
the maker of the world’s largest wind turbines, but a few years later it gave up on the
devices, taking a back seat in the business driven by its once 50-50 partner Vestas. In
February 2021, the manufacturer announced that a new joint venture, MHI Vestas
Offshore Wind, will supply Japan’s offshore wind market. So far, Vestas is playing
more of a marketing role.

Hitachi pulled out of the wind turbine business in 2019, citing global competition, and
said it would instead focus on distributing machines made by Germany’s Enercon. In
the same year, Japan Steel Works withdrew from the business also, although it
stopped producing wind turbines back in 2016.

In 2021, Toshiba became the first major domestic engineering conglomerate to wade
back into wind turbine production, but only as a local partner for GE to help produce
parts for the assembly of the U.S. firm’s Haliade-X turbine nacelle.

Unlike its domestic peers, Toshiba scored an early victory because half a year after the
GE partnership was announced, a group led by Mitsubishi Corp swept at Japan’s first
major offshore wind tenders. All three of Mitsubishi’s projects will install GE turbines.

The big win could help the Toshiba group act as the hub to regroup the domestic
turbine component makers, although the government has revised the next set of
offshore wind auctions so that the Mitsubishi group is unable to repeat their success.
As such, Toshiba and GE will need to seek favor with other project developers in a
very competitive market.

Until these large offshore wind projects begin construction, turbine orders are likely to
remain small with onshore developments constrained by land availability and local
concerns. Last year, there was just 233 MW of new wind capacity installed in Japan,
with Vestas as the top supplier, according to JWPA data. This took the market total to
4.8 GW.

JE Wind is the only existing wind turbine manufacturer in Japan that produces MW-
class turbines.


Finance and construction
Since offshore wind power projects are still new for Japan, there are concerns about
risks of project completion. Thus, only big players (keiretsu group companies) tend to
participate since they are able to secure financing.

Due to high costs, companies must form a consortium to build the supply chain and
complete construction. Usually, the group is led by a general construction company or
engineering procurement and construction company (EPC), or a trading company that
offers financing. Majors in this segment include Toshiba, Hitachi, JFE Holdings,
Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Toray, and Penta-Ocean
Construction.

The assessment involves environmental research at the installation site, such as the
local weather patterns, tide and currents, seabed, as well as the impact that the wind
project will have on local communities, etc. Once the project zones are defined, the
consortiums that plan to bid will conduct their own assessment.

Traditionally in Japan, EPC companies – JGC, Chiyoda, Toyo Engineering – led the
building of a power plant. For construction of offshore wind plants, however, major
construction companies such as Kajima, Shimizu, Obayashi, Toa, Penta-Ocean have
taken the lead. These companies build wind turbine foundations and towers, as well
as other structures.

For the big three Round 1 projects won by Mitsubishi, Kajima is said to be the general
contractor after agreeing to a multi-project discount. Other firms involved at the
engineering and construction stage often involve subsidiaries of trading companies
and oil and gas firms. These include Mitsubishi Energy Solutions, Marubeni Power
Systems, Cosmo Engineering, GE Power Solutions, CTech, etc.

Ancillary work
A crucial but often overlooked part of offshore wind power is the vital infrastructure
around the turbines. This includes laying cables between the offshore power station,
sub stations and onshore stations.

Japan’s offshore wind stations are built relatively close to shore; however, the area is
often marked by steep subsea slopes and deep water. Technological advances are
needed to overcome these issues.

Shipping companies such as Mitsui OSK Line and NYK Line provide offshore wind
projects with self-elevating platforms and deliver construction materials offshore. They
also provide crew-transfer vessels (CTVs) for transporting construction workers,
engineers, and operators.

Not all the residents living near a project site welcome construction of wind turbines,
but giving some orders to local companies often helps to soften such opposition and
stimulate the local economy. These contracts include lodging, transportation,
insurance, labor, security service, garbage collection, etc.


Operation and maintenance
Once the wind farm is completed, usually after just a few years, operation and
maintenance begins. While the daily operation is conducted by the electric power
company or the owner of the power plant, safe and stable operation must be
guaranteed, especially in the face of extreme weather such as typhoons and strong
tides and currents. Subsea drones and other unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs)
to monitor the towers can help with maintenance.

Cosmo and Eurus Energy are just a few of the companies involved in running wind
projects and doing maintenance.

Finally, wind farm operators will have to think of what to do with the turbines once
they reach their termination point, usually after 30 years. Decommissioning and
recycling are done by O&M companies, which are often local subcontractors with a
special license in industrial waste recycling.

Cost basis of offshore wind projects




Source: METI
All of the stages of offshore wind power development in Japan offer tremendous
business opportunities for industry and service firms. But the long-term gestation of
the offshore wind projects mean that it will be those that dig in for the long term that
gain the fruit of the Japanese market once it finally ripens around the second half of
this decade.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Brazil/ biofuel
Acelen will invest $2.44 billion in a biorefinery to make "green" diesel and jet fuel,
with an annual capacity of 1 billion liters of hydrotreated vegetable oil. Construction
begins in January 2024; launch is slated for 2026.

Brazil/ Solar power
ArcelorMittal Brazil (AMB) will form a JV with Casa dos Ventos, a leading local
renewable energy developer, to build a 554 MW wind power project. AMB will own
55%, while Casa dos Ventos will have 45% in the $800 million project in the Bahia
region.

China/ Coal demand
The rise in EV sales in the world’s largest EV market will increase pressure on grids,
which are struggling amid low hydropower output and rising power demand from
industry and households, especially from rising EV fleets. This means that China will
rely more on coal to provide the country with power, said consultancy ANZ Group.

Europe/ Offshore wind power
Danish energy firm Orsted and Spain’s Acciona will team up to develop cost-effective
foundations for floating offshore wind turbines. They’ll explore the use of carbon-
neutral bio-concrete and other materials.
Germany/ Energy efficiency
The cabinet banned most new oil and gas heating systems starting 2024; new systems
will have to run on 65% renewable energy. This will engender costs of €9 billion
annually; the govt will subsidize 50%. Heating accounts for 15% of Germany’s GHG
emissions.

G7/ Russian nuclear materials
Japan, the UK, Canada, the U.S. and France agreed to co-operate to reduce
dependence on Russia as a nuclear materials and technology source. This came at the
Nuclear Energy Forum during the G7 ministers on climate, energy and environment
meeting in Sapporo.

Iraq/ Oil exports
Iraq restarted crude oil exports from its autonomous region of Kurdistan, settling most
of their differences with regards to oil exports that travel by pipeline to Turkey.

Pakistan/ Oil
The country placed its first order for discounted Russian crude oil, which will dock in
Karachi in May. Pakistan is a close U.S. ally, but faces an acute balance of payments
crisis, risking default on its debt.

Ecorer won the 100 MW Montalvo solar project in the Moquegua region. Ecorer is a
subsidiary of hydroelectric producer Compañía Eléctrica El Platanal, and it already has
concessions for wind projects: Acarí (40 MW), Acarí 2 (50 MW) and La Quebrada (100
MW).

Russia/ Oil exports
Despite Moscow's pledge to cut output, the amount of crude exports and transit this
month from the ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk will rise above 10
million tons, up from 9.7 million tons in March.

Kazakhstan/ Natural gas
Russia offered to sell natural gas to Kazakhstan at a lower price than for Belarus, which
pays Moscow an equivalent of €117 per 1,000 c/m. Moscow and Astana also agreed
on a preliminary plan for gas pipelines. In Europe, gas trades at about €430 per 1,000
c/m.

U.S./ LNG
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved LNG export terminals – Texas
LNG, and Rio Grande LNG – as well the associated Rio Bravo Pipeline. Environmental
activists, such as the Sierra Club, want a rehearing of the approvals, saying “We're not
backing down.”
