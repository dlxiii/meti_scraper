NEWS:    SOLAR     AND   BATTERIES



Japan delays bill to mandate solar panel recycling
(Government statement, May 13)
•  The MoE and METI won’t be able to submit a bill mandating solar panel recycling in the current
parliamentary session.
•  The delay owes to the Cabinet Legislation Bureau's request to address inconsistencies with existing
laws, particularly who bears the responsibility for recycling costs.
•  The proposed bill had aimed to make the manufacturers responsible for recycling expenses. While
this is feasible for new panels, it's difficult to apply retroactively.
•  MoE and METI ministers said they’ll revise the bill by referencing other recycling laws, such as for
autos and electronic devices, and submit it “as soon as possible”.
•  CONTEXT: With most solar panels to reach the end of lifespan in the 2030s, concerns are growing over
mass disposal and landfill use. Estimates suggest that annual disposal could peak at around 170,000 to
280,000 tons between 2035 and 2037.
• TAKEAWAY: In March, an expert panel suggested that both domestic manufacturers and importers should share
recycling costs. However, this contrasts with models like Japan’s end-of-life automobile recycling law, where

8



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

owners pay, raising legal consistency concerns. The bill was supposed to build on the amendment to the
Renewable Energy Act in April 2022, which requires operators of solar power facilities over 10 kW to set aside
funds for equipment disposal. The bill’s success will depend on fair distribution of responsibilities, the
establishment of a clear legal framework, effective enforcement, and the development of adequate recycling
infrastructure. Japan lacks legislation for PV waste management. Also, as the bill stipulates that manufacturers
or importers bear recycling costs, while equipment owners cover dismantling, this may disproportionately affect
domestic manufacturers, especially if importers of foreign-made panels, notably from China, evade
responsibilities.



Renova to invest up to ¥200 billion in grid-scale battery storage
(Nikkei, Company statement, May 12-13)
•  Renewables developer Renova plans to invest up to ¥200 billion by 2030 to develop grid-connected
battery storage facilities across Japan.
•  This marks a strategic pivot from large-scale solar to battery storage as Renova's growth focus. The
shift comes as solar and wind energy have increasingly led to grid strain and output curtailments
when supply exceeds demand.
•  The firm aims to expand its storage capacity from the current 230 MW (from three sites awarded
subsidies via the LTDA) to 1 GW by the early 2030s. It plans to fund 80% of investment via project

finance, and is considering JVs and govt subsidies.
•  CONTEXT: Renova developed and owns a 1.5 GW portfolio in total generation capacity across multiple
energy sources, with total assets worth around ¥500 billion – including solar power (429 MW), onshore
wind (346 MW), and biomass (445 MW).
•  Battery storage is seen as key to reducing the curtailment of solar farms, particularly in areas like
Kyushu, where it reached 6% in FY2025. As of Sept 2024, only 100 MW of grid-scale batteries were
connected in Japan.
•  Renova said it will invest around ¥340 billion in small-scale solar power, storage batteries, and
other areas like onshore wind power by FY2031.
• TAKEAWAY: Renova expects increased demand for balancing capacity, and a significant reduction in BESS costs,
accelerating faster battery connections to the grid. A focus shift to BESS comes as Renova expects to post its first
net quarterly loss since listing, due to issues at its biomass power plants. The latter struggle as Japan moves
away from FIT to FIP, which carries explicit market price volatility risk, due to high fixed operating costs.
Meanwhile, the BESS market is seen as a blue ocean. If METI’s 2030 forecasts are correct, and the country will
have 24 GWh of BESS installed by then, it means the current 100 MW (at an average discharge duration of 3
hours) would need to grow about 80x.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO launches its first grid-connected BESS in Gunma
(Company statement, May 15)
o  TEPCO began operating its first battery energy storage facility in Tsumagoi Village, Gunma
Pref. The project received a grant from METI/ANRE.
o  Developed with NTT Anode Energy, the 2 MW facility stores electricity during low-price
periods and discharges it when prices are high.
o  It also aims to support grid stability amid increasing use of renewable energy.

•  While Japan leads in research, challenges remain in efficiency and cost. Experts will draft a roadmap
by this autumn for real-world implementation.
•  CONTEXT: Artificial photosynthesis is a promising approach to reducing GHGs that uses CO2 emitted
from factories and power plants as a raw material for chemical products while using clean hydrogen. In
the process, solar power is used to split water and make hydrogen. This hydrogen, combined with CO2
from factories, can produce olefin, turning a process that used to emit CO2 into one that absorbs it.
•  Mitsubishi Chemical participated in an artificial photosynthesis project conducted by NEDO and has
been pushing forward with development in partnership with domestic chemical manufacturers,
universities, national institutes, etc.

Alaska says talks are underway with Japanese firms for LNG project
(Nikkei, May 13)
•  Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy said discussions are underway with several Asian countries on the
Alaska LNG project. These include Japan, South Korea, and India.
•  Talks with several Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Corp, already took place. Discussions
are in early stages.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese energy companies and trading firms are considering involvement. Still, they have
concerns about profitability. The project will likely cost at least $44 billion due to high pipeline
construction expenses. This is raising doubts about feasibility.
•  Dunleavy suggested breaking up the project to reduce the financial burden.
• TAKEAWAY: The U.S. side is said to have split the project into three stages, offering potential stakeholders more
digestible investment portions and extending payment over a broad period of time. Part of the piped gas would
also be diverted for local needs, which is touted as an early-stage revenue stream. What will push the currently
exploratory discussions into more concrete contracts, however, is unclear. Japanese companies likely are waiting
on state guarantees and other backing from the govt. PM Ishiba’s Cabinet will likely weigh its involvement based
on progress in trade talks with the U.S. In that sense, we may see signing of MoU-like terms in June.

ANALYSIS

BY CHISAKI WATANABE

Geothermal Power Gains Steam as Japan Talks Up Potential
In his first policy speech, it wasn’t solar or offshore wind power that Prime Minister
Ishiba mentioned as a renewable energy source with high potential. As Japan’s 102nd
premier took office in October 2024, he counted geothermal power among promising
energy sources to address Japan’s energy constraints.

In a major policy speech by a Japanese leader, the choice of geothermal energy, which
uses underground heat to drive turbines, was unusual. Despite its well-known potential,
geothermal energy development has barely progressed in Japan even after the feed-in-
tariff (FIT)-driven renewables boom was unleashed in 2012.

Most of the capacity added since then has been in solar power, and the big bet for the
2030s is on offshore wind. Meanwhile, biomass and hydro have enjoyed mild success.
But geothermal?
Since Ishiba’s inauguration, however, geothermal energy has gained momentum. In
November, METI and MoE unveiled a policy package to bolster developments in the
sector. The package includes the “Geothermal Frontier Project” to expand geothermal
power using conventional technologies. Officials also set up a public-private forum to
promote next-generation geothermal technologies, with more than 70 companies and
groups joining as members.

Buoyed by increased demand for clean electricity, the sector is on the cusp of a
technological breakthrough. Some of the emerging tech is forecast to increase Japan’s
geothermal potential by more than four-fold. So, what’s different this time?
Hello again, Sunshine
“For the first time since the Sunshine Project of the 1970s, the geothermal energy sector
is being revitalized,” Hosono Goshi, a former minister of the environment, declared in
November in relation to the Geothermal Frontier Project. Hosono is a member of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party. He’s also become the head of a coalition of bipartisan
lawmakers that promote geothermal power.

The government launched the Sunshine Project in 1974 to boost R&D in “new energy”
technologies following the oil shock of the previous year. The idea was to reduce Japan’s
dependence on oil by developing alternative energy sources. While it is best known for
guiding the early progress with solar panels, the project also supported geothermal and
wind power.
The renewed focus on geothermal comes as Japan’s electricity demand is projected to
increase substantially thanks to wider application of AI and data centers. The change
also comes amid an increasing need to decarbonize the power mix to meet climate
goals.

Japan’s push in renewables has been so far centered around solar and wind, both
intermittent sources that are causing a growing curtailment trend. In contrast,
geothermal is classified as a baseload power source.

Geothermal tech uses heat to produce steam, which drives turbines to generate
decarbonized electricity consistently and continuously. Hence, geothermal is welcomed

by planners looking for clean energy sources to integrate more solar and wind on the
grid.
Currently, Japan has more than two dozen geothermal power stations, many located in
the Tohoku and Kyushu regions. The country’s installed capacity is about 0.6 GW, a
fraction of its potential of 23 GW, which is the world’s third largest.

About half of Japan’s geothermal plants launched before 2012, when the government
introduced the FIT program to incentivize renewable energy deployment. In the early
2000s, domestic turbine makers such as Toshiba, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Fuji
Electric held a two-thirds global market share in geothermal turbines thanks to sales at
home, in Southeast Asia, Kenya and elsewhere.
But not many new plants are due to come online in Japan in the near future. According
to a government report, there are only two projects with definite start dates over the
next four years. INPEX is building a 15 MW project with Idemitsu and TEPCO
Renewable Power in Akita Pref, slated to open in March 2027. Another 15 MW station,
also in Akita, is under development by Tohoku Electric’s renewables unit, and slated to
start operations in November 2029.

Two more projects are in advanced stages, but they have no publicly available start
dates.

Greater Expectations
In the Sixth Basic Energy Plan released in October 2021, geothermal power’s FY2030
target was set at 1.5 GW (11 TWh), or 1% of Japan’s total electricity. That was
upgraded in the Plan’s seventh edition, adopted by the Cabinet in February, calling on
geothermal power to account for 1 - 2 % of the generation mix by FY2040. The latest
Plan does not specify capacity and generation targets, but that share roughly translates
to 11 to 12 TWh, according to Japan NRG calculations.
Even based on the minimum FY2040 target, which can be assumed as 1.5 GW, Japan
needs to add nearly 1 GW of geothermal capacity within 15 years. That’s not easy given
the size of the stations under construction and the fact that it takes about 10 years to
build a new plant.

The government has tried to identify the factors holding back the sector. In the
geothermal policy package released in November, the following reasons were cited:
•  Large risks during early stages of development
•  Long lead time to receive approvals and permissions aligned with laws on hot
springs, natural parks, and forests, as well as the need to gain local understanding,
and agreement with hot spring operators

Natural parks play a big role in geothermal in Japan. About 80% of the country’s
potential is located in national and quasi-national park acreage. Development in those

parks, however, has been largely restricted since 1974 after water quality concerns and
landscape damage issues marred several projects.
Officials revised these development guidelines in 2012, 2015 and 2021, in effect
expanding the areas open for drilling and construction amid increasing calls to deliver
more renewables. The government has been also working to promote understanding
from hot spring operators to placate their concerns about possible impact on hot water
sources, since geothermal power plants are often built nearby.

In order to address these geothermal industry’s problems, the government said it will
make changes including:
1) The government will take on the early development risks. State-backed energy
firm, JOGMEC, will expand the scope of survey from the very early stage
(ground-level geological survey, small diameter drilling) to the early stage
(drilling, short-term flow tests) and the exploration stage (flow tests).
2) METI will lead the coordination with ministries and local governments to
expedite the approval process and the consensus-building process among local
stakeholders.
3) The government will replicate successful approaches to other projects to speed
up geothermal development nationwide.
The above initiatives are intended to accelerate geothermal deployment using
conventional technologies, which use hot water and steam that naturally exist in
geothermal reservoirs. But there are also technological innovations.

Next Generation
Last November’s package also included measures to support new tech. Japan, like other
major countries, is increasingly looking at the next set of technologies that promise to
utilize more of geothermal resources by delving into wider and deeper areas.
Introducing technologies such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), closed-loop
geothermal systems, supercritical geothermal systems, and EGS using carbon dioxide,
could add 77 GW more of geothermal potential in Japan, according to METI estimates.
Chart 1: Different types of geothermal technologies















Source: IEA report “The Future of Geothermal Energy”

On April 14, METI launched a public-private council to specifically discuss next-
generation geothermal technologies, planning to commercialize these and strengthen
industrial competitiveness by the early 2030’s.

The council, uniting more than 70 companies and groups, will set targets and plans to
deploy more geothermal, as well as to compile a roadmap by around October this year.
This will include measures to reduce costs and expand Japan’s market share for this tech
overseas.
Conclusion
The planned roadmap appears to heavily focus on how to ensure Japan can lead in
geothermal technology. Past government pilot projects, however, indicate that
technology alone will not be enough.

Expanding next-gen geothermal power requires more overarching plans to address
challenges, such as how to develop a supply chain and where to build new plants in
order to offer baseload power to heavy energy users such as data centers.
The co-location of clean power and new heavy energy users is being discussed by the
Cabinet’s industry location working group for the Green Transformation (GX) that
kicked off in April. WIth a stronger concerted effort, geothermal energy could become
well positioned to make its mark in Japan’s energy sector.

Watt-Bit Coordination: Future of Integrated Power and Comm Infrastructure

The rise of artificial intelligence and Japan’s drive for digital transformation is forecasted
to boost power demand from data centers by 12-fold over the next 10 years. For such a
surge to be met with clean energy, Japan needs both massive investment and thorough
state planning.
Toward that goal, the Watt-Bit Coordination (WBC) initiative will play a crucial role.
Created to promote a strategic approach to infrastructure development, particularly
proposing how to integrate the power (Watt) and communication (Bit) facilities, the
initiative has gathered a broad body of Japanese and international businesses.

Proposed by TEPCO Power Grid during the "GX2040 Leaders Panel" in 2024, the WBC
focuses on an integrated development of power systems and communication
infrastructure, recognizing that physical separation between decarbonized power
sources and data centers can lead to increased costs and time for grid development.
By leveraging the cost-effectiveness of optical fiber cables – at 1% the cost of power
transmission lines – the strategy involves situating data centers near clean power sources
and extending cables to transmit information, thereby overcoming physical distance
constraints.

Challenges
In March 2025, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) and METI
launched the Public-Private Council on Watt-Bit Coordination Roundtable to shepherd
stakeholders in the power and telecommunication sectors into coordinating their
activities, aiming to improve the efficiency of new infrastructure built to support DCs.

The widespread adoption of AI technologies has led to a major increase in power
consumption by data centers. According to an OCCTO January 2025 report, the
maximum power demand nationwide for FY2034 will be 165 GW, while total power
consumption will be about 852 TWh.
When compared to the final year (FY2033) of the supply plan submitted by TSOs last
year, the maximum power demand was revised upward by 3.06 GW from 162 GW to
165 GW, and the total electricity demand was revised upward by 17,960 GWh from 835
TWh to 852 TWh. By FY2034, the power usage and peak demand by data centers and
semiconductor factories is projected to rise to 51.4 TWh and 7.15 GW, respectively.

In terms of regional breakdown, the Tokyo area is expected to account for nearly 60% of
the total, with further growth anticipated. However, the report also indicates that
demand at data centers and semiconductor factories is also expected to increase in
regions outside the metropolitan area.

Currently, over 80% of Japan's data centers are concentrated in the Tokyo and Osaka
metropolitan areas, which poses risks related to natural disasters and power supply
constraints. Also, the limited availability of suitable land and high cost of electricity in
these regions hinder expansion of data center facilities. Plans to build data centers in
urban downtowns have met strong opposition from residents.

Power infrastructure investment
According to the Second Master Plan for Regional Interconnection Systems announced
by OCCTO in March 2023, the estimated investment required to strengthen the power
system through 2050 varies slightly depending on the scenario, but is estimated to be
about ¥6 trillion to a maximum of ¥7.9 trillion.

•  Construction of a new undersea DC transmission line connecting Hokkaido,
Tohoku and Tokyo: about ¥2.5 trillion to ¥3.4 trillion
•  Strengthening the power transmission network between Kyushu and the
Chugoku region: about ¥420 billion
•  Strengthening of frequency conversion facilities between the eastern and
western regions: about ¥400 to ¥430 billion
•  Strengthening within each area: Hokkaido about ¥1.1 trillion, Tohoku about
¥650 billion, and Tokyo about ¥640 billion.
These investments will strengthen the power transmission network connecting regions
with abundant renewable energy generation (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kyushu, etc.) and
major consumption areas (Tokyo, Osaka, etc). For the transmission network connecting
Hokkaido and Tokyo, ¥1.5 to ¥1.8 trillion will be invested in laying undersea cables in

22

the Sea of Japan, with plans to expand capacity to 3.5 times the current level by around
FY2030.

These transmission network improvements are expected to facilitate the expansion of
renewable energy use while ensuring stable supply. Other benefits include reduced fuel
costs resulting from the shift from thermal to renewable power generation.
Energy conservation can help
Energy-saving technologies for DCs are also advancing, such as highly efficient cooling
systems, improvements in power usage effectiveness, and effective utilization of waste
heat. Also, technology development is being promoted in areas such as all-photonics
network (APN) technology, which minimizes processing in DC and communication
networks by using light as much as possible, and optoelectronic fusion device
technology.

NTT's IOWN (Innovative Optical & Wireless Network) initiative is an innovative effort to
realize a new world and a prosperous society that cannot be achieved with the current
network infrastructure.
To mitigate risks associated with data center concentration, the government wants their
regional distribution, which involves developing in areas with abundant renewable
energy sources, such as Hokkaido and Kyushu. These regions offer advantages like
cooler climates, which reduce cooling costs, and the availability of solar, wind, and
geothermal energy.

The Watt-Bit Coordination emphasizes the integration of power and communication
infrastructure to enhance efficiency. By building data centers near decarbonized power
sources and utilizing optical fiber cables for data transmission, the initiative aims to
reduce the need for extensive power grid development. This also supports the
establishment of off-grid data centers, which can operate independently using local
renewable energy sources.
In summary, the Coordination represents a strategic response to the evolving demands
of the digital infrastructures. Its key policy implications include:
•  Encouraging public and private investment in integrated infrastructure.
•  Aligning regulations across sectors to facilitate Watt-Bit planning and
development
•  Incentivizing the establishment of data centers in regions with renewable
energy potential.

Conclusion
This summer, the government has promised to deliver more details and concrete steps
for the Watt-Bit Coordination initiative that should act as the blueprint for new energy
and digital facility developments.
Such a comprehensive roadmap and plan is unlikely to deliver all the answers for either
the energy or telecommunications sectors. Further updates will likely be needed to
address also any non-technical challenges, such as local community consent and water
management.

Most importantly the process has started. Over the coming decades, data and energy
developers should soon have a baseline from which to plan their business growth.
