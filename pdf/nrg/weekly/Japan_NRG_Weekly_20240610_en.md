Japan, EU to develop international hydrogen standards to expand its potential usage

(Government statement, June 3)
•  METI minister Saito and EU Commissioner for Energy Simson agreed to form a working plan to
expand hydrogen’s potential.
•  This includes exchanging information on hydrogen promotion efforts, such as the Japanese
Hydrogen Society Promotion Act and the European Hydrogen Bank, with the goal to build resilient
and sustainable supply chains.
•  There’ll also be information sharing on standardization for electrolysers, large-scale liquefied

hydrogen tanks, and refueling infrastructure for heavy duty vehicles, etc.
•  Separate cooperation agreements were signed by:
o  Japan Hydrogen Association (JH2A) and Hydrogen Europe
o  NEDO and Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (CHJU)
o  JOGMEC and H2GLOBAL
o  JH2A and H2GLOBAL
o  Kawasaki Heavy Industry and Daimler.

•  CONTEXT: METI seeks closer cooperation with EU counterparts to create new rules and standards;
this approach is possibly more realistic than developing Japanese standards into global
benchmarks, according to an industry source.
• TAKEAWAY: In Japan, corporate cooperation to set standards isn’t seen as anti-competitive, unless they
exclude other players wanting to join. In Germany, for example, the Federal Cartel Office has the authority to
act if it sees a competition violation. KHI and Daimler’s cooperation seeks to write technical hydrogen

standards. As the initiative falls under bilateral collaboration, it’ll be protected from possible anti-competition
allegations from peers developing different technologies. However, if, say, the standard writers begin charging
licensing fees to others to be compliant, antitrust issues may be raised.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan Hydrogen Fund to lead 400 companies in ¥150 billion funding effort
(Nikkei, June 5)
o  About 400 companies including Toyota Motor, Kawasaki Heavy Industry, plan to join the
Japan Hydrogen Fund that will have a financing capacity of ¥150 billion.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Itochu launches ammonia hydrogen FS in Kitakyushu

(Company statement, June 3)
o  Itochu Corp launched feasibility studies for building ammonia and hydrogen supply chain
infrastructure in the city of Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Pref.
o  The studies include hydrogen production in the Hibiki Nada coastal area, and the
transport of hydrogen to consumers via pipelines.
o  CONTEXT: Since February, Kitakyushu city has been testing the transport of hydrogen to
consumers via a 1.2 km pipeline. Nippon Steel supplies the hydrogen and Iwatani Corp

manages the pipeline.

Japan Hydrogen Fund to set up IPEF Window for projects in Asia
(Government statement, June 6)
•  The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity Window will be set up within the Japan
Hydrogen Fund (JHF) to finance building hydrogen value chains in Asia.
•  JHF is a private fund to be set up this year by the Japan Hydrogen Association and its members.

Advantage Partners will run the fund.
•  CONTEXT: The IPEF is a framework for a clean and fair economy that consists of Australia, Brunei,
Fiji, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the
U.S., and Vietnam.
•  The aim of the IPEF Window is to drive private sector investments; it’s open to finance both private
and public sector projects.

•  Funding scope includes, but not limited to:
o  Facilities for hydrogen production, including electrolyzers and renewables
o  Converting hydrogen to ammonia and other hydrogen carrier technologies such as
liquefied hydrogen and metal hydride
o  Hydrogen transport and storage infrastructures
o  Hydrogen-fired power generation
• TAKEAWAY: The IPEF Window reflects Japan’s long-standing climate position to allow multiple paths to net

zero. Producing hydrogen with a low-carbon footprint takes priority but the fund’s scope is not limited to
“green hydrogen”.
It is interesting to see metal hydride included in the funding scope. Some shipping companies say this

technology is not fit for large-scale hydrogen transport as the metal is heavy. However, it is safer since there is
almost no likelihood of gas leakage.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
IPEF members sign three pacts

(Government statement, June 6)
o  Some 14 IPEF industrial ministers signed the IPEF Clean Economy Agreement, the IPEF
Fair Economy Agreement and the Agreement on IPEF, which states basic framework
principles.
o  The Clean Economy Agreement supports transitions to clean economies consistent with
respective pathways.

▪  The IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund, to support the building of clean energy
infrastructure, was launched;
▪  The First Investor Forum was held, identifying over $23 billion priority
infrastructure projects;

▪  New cooperative working programs on emission accounting, e-wastes, and small
modular reactors were launched.
o  The Fair Economy Agreement aims to improve transparency and predictability of
businesses in the IPEF region.

MoE minister urges Sumitomo, TEPCO RE to review offshore wind farm impact
(Government statement, May 31)
•  Japan’s environment minister urged a consortium led by Sumitomo and TEPCO Renewable Energy
to review the environmental impact of plans for a 670 MW wind farm on the south side of the

Japan Sea off Aomori Pref.
•  The minister urged the firms to reconsider:
o  Wind power generation layout – it should accord with the area set by Aomori Pref;
o  The impact of noise on local living conditions, with a suggestion that wind turbine
shadows be avoided or minimized;
o  The impact on local wildlife, especially migratory birds;
o  The impact on scenic views.

•  The firms want to install between 34 and 45 turbines with an individual output of 15-20 MW each.
•  The site stretches across a 10,425 ha area in the Japan Sea near Tsugaru City and Ajigasawa Town,
Aomori Pref.
•  CONTEXT: The area near Tsugaru City is one of two areas designated in Round 3 of auctions to
select operators for new offshore wind farms. In March, the govt rolled out a total potential
capacity of 1.05 GW for two projects in Round 3. One area, which has a capacity of 600 MW, is
located on the south side of the Japan Sea near Tsugaru City. The other area, with a capacity of

450 MW, is located off the coast of Yamagata Pref. The tender runs until July 19.



METI publishes FY2023 Energy white paper – power demand forecast to grow

(Government statement, June 4)
•  METI published its Energy White Paper summarizing policy, as well as FY2023 supply and demand
trends. Key topics included the Fukushima treated water release and regional reconstruction,
energy security, climate action, and green transformation.
•  Power demand is forecast to grow on the back of AI and data center demand; the outlook a year
ago was a demand decline.
•  Fuel prices subsided from 2022 levels but were higher compared to five-years ago. Fossil fuel

import costs have led to trade deficits.
•  On climate action, Japan is on track with GHG reduction goals and pledged to double renewables
by 2030 and triple nuclear power capacity by 2050.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE analyzes impact of rooftop solar on utility power demand
(Government statement, June 3)
o  Residential rooftop solar panels reduced demand for power from utilities by 0.5% on July

18, 2023 when consumption hit the summer’s high of 1 TWh, said ANRE.
o  At 15:00 when demand was the highest, the panels curbed consumption by 1.2%.
o  865,748 homes in the Tokyo area are estimated to have rooftop solar panels.

Kioxia president: Renewable energy support measures are essential to stay competitive
(Bloomberg Japan, June 6)
•  Speaking at a subcommittee of METI’s Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy,
Kioxia president Hayasaka said he predicts that the chipmaker’s energy consumption will increase

by an annual average of about 10% up to FY2040.
•  He also explained Kioxia’s dilemma: It has a goal of 100% renewables usage by 2040, but current
supply of renewables is low and their price is high.
•  CONTEXT: Increasing chip capacity while achieving decarbonization isn’t easy. TSMC is set to use
around 10%-12% of Taiwan’s power supply by 2030 (up from the current 8%). Kioxia uses around
0.5% of Japan’s power supply, also expected to rise. The discussion was attended by executives
from SoftBank, JFE Holdings, NTT, etc.




Sapporo becomes special GX business zone
(Government statement, June 4)
•  The Financial Services Agency selected the city of Sapporo in Hokkaido as a special business zone

to attract foreign investment into clean energy.
•  The Special Zones for Financial and Asset Management Businesses will include:
o  New visa categories for foreigners, English-language administrative procedures such as
business registration,
o  relaxing bank rules for financing startups, etc. (task of national govt);
o  local tax cuts and subsidies (city of Sapporo).
•  Rules on hydrogen storage, such as the cap on the storage volume, will be relaxed.




MoE expands online GHGs inventory reporting system
(Government statement, June 3)
•  The MoE expanded the Energy Efficiency and Global Warming Countermeasures online reporting

system (EEGS) to entities not required to report GHG emissions.
•  Entities that consume less than 1,500 kiloliters of oil-equivalent of energy are exempt from annual
GHGs reporting but can disclose emissions by filing their data to EEGS.
•  CONTEXT: Reporting of annual emissions is limited to large companies. For example, Tokyo has
660,000 business entities but only about 1,300 of them report their emissions.




Govt approves Integrated Innovation Strategy 2024, nuclear fusion included
(Government statement, June 4)
•  The govt approved the "Integrated Innovation Strategy 2024,” which prioritizes fusion energy,
aiming to demonstrate power generation by the 2030s.
•  It also seeks to strengthen the Quantum Science and Technology Research and Development

Organization (QST). Finally, it aims to set up test facilities for startups.
•  The strategy also supports research on next-gen reactors with new safety mechanisms.

ANRE: Tokyo’s summer power supply faces risk due to aging thermal power plants

(Government statement, June 3)
•  ANRE warned that the power supply in the Tokyo area faces risks as 10% of its power sources are
thermal power plants operational for more than 40 years.
•  Another risk is the concentration of these plants in the Tokyo Bay area.
•  OCCTO lowered the July power margin forecast in Tokyo to 4.1% from the previous 5.7%; August
to 8%, down from 8.7%; and September to 11.8%, down from 11.9%.
•  The 3% margin rate, the minimum threshold, was cleared, but ANRE will request power operators

to conduct thorough facility inspections.
•  The power margin forecast in the Hokkaido and Tohoku areas were also reduced, while those of
Chubu, Hokuriku, Kansai, Chugoku and Shikoku areas mostly rose. There were no changes for
Kyushu and Okinawa.
•  The 948 MW Haramachi power plant in Tohoku closed temporarily in May due to technical issues;
it will restart on July 29. The 490 MW Kawasaki power plant in Tokyo closed in April; there’s no

•  Japan's domestic battery storage capacity will grow from 2GWh in 2023 to 40GWh by 2030,
according to Sumitomo’s forecasts. The trading house has a 6 MW energy storage facility near the
city of Chitose, in Hokkaido, close to the location of a new semiconductor factory being built by
Rapidus.
•  CONTEXT: Battery storage is crucial for managing solar and wind power's intermittent nature in
Japan's renewable energy efforts.




Sumitomo Electric acquires Germany’s Südkabel to deliver HVDC projects
(Company statement, June 6)
•  Sumitomo Electric (SE) is set to acquire 90% of shares in Südkabel, a German high-voltage cable

manufacturer. The deal is expected to be completed by October.
•  The firm will expand its production capacity in Mannheim, to locally manufacture 525 kV HVDC
cables. SE will invest €90 million in Südkabel's production capacity.
•  CONTEXT: Germany’s TSO Amprion awarded two major HVDC cable projects — Korridor B V49
and part of the Rhein-Main-Link project — to Sumitomo Electric. The total project value is more
than €3 billion. The HVDC cables will be manufactured at Südkabel. The projects are expected to
be completed by 2033.

KEPCO managed power oversupply in Kansai region due to solar power surplus

(Denki Shimbun, June 4)
•  On June 1 and 2, KEPCO requested OCCTO to transfer excess renewable power to other regions
in case supply exceeded demand due to a surge in solar generation in the Kansai area. This is the
third time that Japan implemented such a measure.
•  The area demand during this period was about 14.5 GW, including for pumped-up water; while
supply was approximately 17.49 GW (including 5 GW of solar and wind combined); this resulted in
an excess supply of some 2.99 GW.



10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  KEPCO was able to control the combined offline and online output of about 2.24 GW of
renewables, including solar power generation facilities of 10 kW or more; but on June 1, there was
still a surplus of some 750 MW outstanding.
•  A maximum of 739 MW was transmitted to areas controlled by Chubu Power Grid and Chugoku
Electric.
•  The same situation occurred on June 2, and a maximum of 718 MW was transmitted to the

Chugoku area to maintain the supply-demand balance in the Kansai area.
•  CONTEXT: The reason for the oversupply is believed to be due to the increased operation of
nuclear power and the decrease of pumped-storage power, as well as the fact that a considerable
amount of residential solar power, installations of less than 10 kW and hence not subject to output
control, had entered the grid.




ENEOS RE plans to build onshore wind farm in western Hokkaido
(Company statement, May 30)
•  ENEOS Renewable Energy plans to develop an onshore wind farm in Obira Town in western
Hokkaido. The maximum capacity is 85.4 MW.

•  The firm plans to start construction in FY2028, and operation is expected to begin in FY2032. It
plans to use up to 17 turbines with an output of between 4.2 MW and 6.1 MW each.
•  CONTEXT: There are several wind power plants in operation in the area, including HSE’s Rumoi
Port wind power generation project.




NRA to discuss fault at Tsuruga NPP over safety concerns
(Denki Shimbun, June 3)
•  The NRA discussed the ‘K Fault’ at Tsuruga NPP Unit 2. Japan Atomic Power Co provided detailed
data on dating and soil analysis around the geological fault line. It said that the ‘K Fault’ hasn’t
been active since the Late Pleistocene, which is defined as between c. 129,000 and c. 11,700 years
ago.

•  CONTEXT: The K Fault has been confirmed at a location about 300 meters north of Unit 2. JAPC
hopes to restart the reactor, but must first prove that the fault does not extend directly beneath
the reactor.
•  The NRA seems to believe it is difficult to completely deny the fault's activity. The regulator
questioned the reliability of the assessment, particularly the depositional age of the strata.
•  The NRA will conduct an on-site investigation on June 6-7 to further test the fault's status.
•  CONTEXT: New regulatory standards prohibit building significant structures on top of active faults.

Tsuruga NPP is located near the active Urasoko fault. This led to complications when experts linked
a bedrock fault beneath the plant to the Urasoko fault. According to NRA definitions, it may be
active. In contrast, the plant operator studied the K Fault in 2014 and concluded that it is not
active. Japan Atomic Power estimated that there has been no movement at K Fault in the last
127,600 years.

Japan to increase the cap on state’s ownership of overseas copper mines to 75%
(Nikkei, June 6)
•  By the end of FY2024, METI plans to allow for the state ownership of copper mines overseas to

reach as high as 75%. Currently, that limit is 50%.
•  JOGMEC will provide the investment.
•  METI aims to increase the volume of copper projects in Africa through financial support to
companies.
•  By 2040, JOGMEC expects Japan’s copper demand to rise 30% (over 2022 levels), reaching 1.35
million tons
•  CONTEXT: JOGMEC is a corporate entity but also a METI umbrella organization, a vehicle for

implementing METI policies, loans, credits, etc.
•  CONTEXT: Global competition to secure copper has inflated investment costs. METI estimates at
least several hundred billion yen will be required to gain a small stake in African projects, which is
beyond budget for most businesses. Currently, JOGMEC is able to take full ownership of rare
earth mining projects but its equity in other mineral projects is capped at 50%.
• TAKEAWAY: In some African countries, mining is a state enterprise and mines are fully or partly state-owned.

As local JV partners are often govts, JOGMEC’s majority ownership of the Japanese stake will facilitate
relationship building. Meanwhile, the rise in copper prices on the back of digitalization and the green
transformation will change how the metal is used. The high prices might trigger substitution, i.e. aluminum
instead of copper for cables. Copper will no longer be used for kitchen utensils but for products with higher
commercial value. This substitution strategy is probably as important as investing in mines and recycling.




INPEX supplies crude to Germany from oil field in Kazakhstan

(Reuters, May 31)
•  In April, INPEX made a trial supply of crude oil from its stake in the Kashagan oil field (Kazakhstan)
to a refinery in Germany, via the Druzhba pipeline.
•  This shows how Kazakhstan is developing oil exports amidst the EU embargo on Russian crude.
•  INPEX is considering more supplies from Kashagan to Germany.
•  CONTEXT: Kazakhstan lacks direct access to international sea routes, and relies on Russian
pipeline infrastructure for exports. INPEX’s trial shipment is a shift from the predominant supplier,

Karachaganak Petroleum Operating (KPO).

LNG stocks increased 8.3% from previous week
(Government data, June 5)
•  LNG stocks of the 10 power utilities were 2.23 million tons as of June 2, up 8.3% from the previous

week (2.06 million tons).
•  This is 7.5% down from the end of May 2023 (2.41 million tons); but 5.7% up from the 5-year
average of 2.11 million tons.
•  According to the JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency), the country will experience a hot summer,
which means more AC usage will be required to stay cool, likely boosting electricity consumption.

Molecules Fight Back: Gas Executives State Case

Against All-Electron Future
Until recently, one of the top tenets of decarbonization was that moving away from
fossil fuels will require a shift from energy systems based on molecules to those
structured around electrons. Electrification would clean-up our cars, furnaces, and
devices, while generation that doesn’t require fuels (such as solar and wind) would
supply power that’s cheaper and less prone to energy security risks.

Last week, most state and business officials gathered in Tokyo for the Japan Energy
Summit & Exhibition refuted this idea.

Electrons will no doubt occupy a more dominant role in our energy systems, but until
we are able to generate and store them at will without the use of fuels, and
independent of weather conditions, countries will need the power of the molecule,
suggested a chorus of executives from Japan and overseas. In addition to the well-
worn arguments about “cost,” the speakers frequently turned to the words “balance”
or “balancing.”


The mood at the summit was similar to one of many recent events in Japan, where on-
stage and private discussions centered on what the participants deemed achievable
or likely, rather than aspirational. Renewables were universally backed, but not to the
exclusion of technologies promising clean gas and liquid solutions.

As Indonesia’s deputy ministry for infrastructure and transportation, H.E. Rachmat
Kaimuddin, said when asked why his country had cut its 2030 renewables target this
January: “This is the number that we see today…. We aligned it to reality.”

(NOTE: Japan NRG is aware that electrons are sub-particles of an atom and that
groups of atoms then make up a molecule. But, bear with us.)

Sober assessments
The Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition (JESE) was originally an event for the natural
gas and LNG industry, with tacit support from METI. Over the last couple of years, the
summit has expanded to cover hydrogen and ammonia topics, and lately renewables.
But with JERA and Tokyo Gas as the main sponsors, it has naturally retained a focus
on the LNG industry.

So, it’s not a surprise that LNG discussions were a core topic at last week’s edition.
However, the nature of the comments from both state and business officials
suggested that there is a genuine re-think inside the Japanese government and
corporate nexus over the ongoing role of gas.

In 2021, when the 6th Basic Energy Plan was confirmed, the role of LNG in the power
mix was forecast to be cut almost in half by 2030, to just a fifth of the total. Coal and
natural gas were seen as on their way out as a prerequisite for the lowering of CO2
emissions, with renewable energy the main winner. The latter’s share was forecast to

16

hit 36-38% by the end of this decade due to an expected rollout of offshore wind
capacity and further growth in utility-scale solar.

The previous Plan, however, was conceived in what officials say was a very different
global environment. Not only was Japan’s shrinking population seen as shaving off a
tenth of the nation’s electricity demand in 10 years, but pre-Ukraine war the world
cared less about energy security and had less consideration for supply chains of
critical raw materials. Each year, Japan’s renewables firms were able to bring online a
steady 6-8 GW of new capacity.

Before the unveiling of PM Kishida’s GX strategy, the Japanese government was
arguably more aligned on its net-zero vision with the pathways proposed by the EU.

Today, Japanese officials are keen to stress the importance of balancing ambitions in
renewable energy with the country’s available resources; of balancing the domestic
roadmaps with actions of other Asian economies; of pursuing multiple options, but
keeping a wary eye on the cost of doing so. The dozen or so high-level speakers from
METI that joined panels at JESE 2024 spoke in a sober and reflective manner.

“It’s too early to say if we’re on track for 2050 or not,” admitted Kobayashi Izuru, a
deputy director general for technology and environment at METI. He noted that the
cost of the GX program is enormous and the ministry most responsible for energy
planning in Japan is very conscious of the need to justify how it is utilizing the nation’s
resources.


Japan will look to mirror some of the economic stimulus measures unveiled by the
U.S. and its IRA legislation, Kobayashi said, while stressing that the technologies METI
wishes to support – among them hydrogen and CCS – will need to be exportable to
Asia and elsewhere to make economic sense.

Hikino Kiyoshi, director of power and gas market policy division at the Agency for
Natural Resources and Energy, was even more blunt: the rate of technological change
(within energy and other fields) is so fast that the government is no longer able to
forecast which tech will gain wider acceptance and which will fade away, or even how
the energy demand picture will look a decade or more from now.

With massive discrepancies in outlook between state and private forecasters, the
government plans to put less emphasis on specific numbers for each energy source in
a future power mix outlook and concentrate its efforts on creating buffers and
optionality.

“The most important thing is to be able to have flexibility to meet changes and
mitigate risks, not focus so much on the numbers of how much this or that power
source” will occupy in a 2030 or 2040 power mix, Hikino said.

While Hikino stressed that there is “no perfect energy source”, it’s clear that the
Japanese government will start to give additional weight going forward to
technologies that are more agile, can combine with others well, and are good at
balancing an ever-more-complex and volatile energy system.

Gas to the rescue?
Several candidates will hope to answer METI’s call for flexibility. Operators of BESS,
LNG, and hydrogen / ammonia facilities will likely vie for greater consideration in
Japan’s energy mix.

Executives from JERA and Tokyo Gas said that Japan should not shy away from using
more LNG to balance a growing variable renewables sector and the widening
fluctuations in seasonal demand. But the LNG sector also needs support from the
government, according to JERA’s Executive Officer Nishizawa Toshi. It should have a
greater allocation in the next Basic Energy Plan and include CCUS in the document’s
LNG bracket.

Despite walking away from a massive long-term LNG supply contract with Qatar a
couple of years ago, JERA is back “in discussion” with the Middle East’s top supplier
on future deals. But to make such commitments, the company needs a “statement on
long-term power demand from the government in the next Basic Energy Plan.”

Cheniere, the world’s No.2 LNG supplier, backed JERA’s comments and added that a
commitment to natural gas isn’t the lock-in to fossil fuels and emissions that critics
claim. Ken Kuroda, a senior advisor to Cheniere Marketing Ltd, said LNG producers
are moving to upgrade the environmental offering of their product by expanding into
e-methane and other clean gas options.

Sempra Infrastructure’s Juancho Eekhout shared details of how the U.S. LNG provider
is working with Japan’s top three gas utilities and Mitsubishi Corp to develop new
clean gas products such as e-Natural Gas (which is synthesized from CO2 and green
hydrogen), as well as blue ammonia. Sempra is even exploring opportunities in Direct
Air Capture (DAC) to make sure its CO2 component is recognized as sustainable.


E-NG “is really a way to bring renewable energy to Japan,” Eekhout said. (NOTE: e-
NG is also sometimes referred to as e-methane.)

A FID on Sempra’s collaboration with Japanese partners will likely be taken in 2025,
and the first cargo will ship to Japan in 2030, said Mitsubishi’s COO of the next-
generation energy division, Wada Tetsuro.

Who will take nuclear’s share?
According to Chris Rowe, RWE’s head of physical LNG trading, Japan needs to plan
for a scenario in which its nuclear power plants are no longer a major base load power
source; restarts of current reactors are taking longer than expected and plans for new
facilities are anemic.

Companies from North America (including ExxonMobil), the Middle East (including
ADNOC and its part-owned Fertiglobe), and India (including ACME Group and
ReNew) were among those at JESE touting the feasibility and economics of hydrogen
or ammonia-fired generation at thermal power plants as a means to achieving clean-
burning baseload power.

“We see Japan as a very attractive country in terms of hydrogen,” said Hayley Pham,
ExxonMobil’s vice president for Asia Pacific business development.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

A slate of ammonia / hydrogen production projects in the U.S. are on the cusp of
making investment decisions based on interest from Japan, said Dan Feldman, the
head of energy and a partner with King & Spalding.

The triggers will include the upcoming contract-for-difference hydrogen auction in
Japan that’s planned for July, which should provide backing to around 10 projects by
early 2025 to move ahead, said Muraki Shigeru, head of the Clean Fuel Ammonia
Association.

The majority of Japan’s ammonia imports will initially be ‘blue’ simply based on cost,
available volumes and deliverability. But the country does need to start putting into
place the conditions for ammonia derived from renewables sources to be competitive,
Muraki said. “If we don’t start now, nothing will change” to the affordability in 10
years, he said.

Those conditions will surely hinge on a more aggressive carbon price, said Takeuchi
Sumiko, a former TEPCO official turned energy researcher and writer, who sits on a
variety of METI expert panels and is a member of the GX Implementation Council.

“We need bold plans, not many plans,” Takeuchi said, speaking on a panel with
ANRE’s Hikino. “If the government offers many scenarios, does it really help
businesses make investments or sign long-term contracts?”


Instead, businesses should probably simply move ahead with their own initiatives. In a
world of many uncertainties, in which even the state energy planners can no longer
offer guidance with assurance, Takeuchi suggested that companies lower their
expectations for state visions and strategies, and rather move forward based on what
they can make work.

NOTES FROM THE EVENT
•  Osaka-based Eplus displayed a new carbon capture, separation and
utilization system that re-uses carbon as fuel on site, eliminating the need to
liquefy the gas to transport it to storage sites. Their Carbon Dioxide Capture
Fuel Recycle (CCFR) consists of a CO2 absorption tower equipped with amine
solution, a CO2 separation tank, an electrolysis system which processes CO2-
rich amine to synthetic fuel raw material, and a control panel, performing
carbon capture, separation and synthetic fuel production on the premises.
The company recorded a CO2 capture speed of 10 tons/ day at a pilot plant
in Tokyo.
•  Germany's Promus Line is proposing the re-use of city gas pipelines for
hydrogen and other clean energy fuels rather than making new installations.
They have developed a suite of petrochemical materials which could be used
as liners to cover the pipes' inner walls.
•  Ueda Takayuki, the CEO of INPEX: “Asia’s domestic natural gas production
will decline, so they will import LNG…natural gas demand will fall, but LNG
will increase.”
•  “LNG as a resource is not an issue, there are plenty of LNG projects. But will
they happen? If everything happens, no need to worry about supplies,” said

Helle Kristoffersen, President Asia of TotalEnergy. It is a “shame” that some
Western banks are no longer funding LNG projects.
•  Fiscal incentives, such as those in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and
the importance of long-term carbon pricing systems, like those being
considered in Japan, will drive the CCS industry, said Ken Freeman at
ExxonMobil.

Energy Jobs in Japan: The Closing of Green and Digital Talent Markets

Japan NRG’s launch of its GxxD reports comes at a time when we as an executive
search agency have noticed a clear closing of the gap between the Green and Digital
talent markets.

The GxxD reports examine the twin focuses on GX (Green Transformation) and DX
(Digital Transformation) that are championed by Japan in a bid to remain competitive,
and gain a competitive advantage in a fast-paced and rapidly changing global
marketplace.

On the ground level we’ve noticed a significant uptick in cross-team projects between
our GreenTech division (renewable energy, green finance, power markets) and our
Business Innovation division (digital transformation, artificial intelligence, business
intelligence).

Increasing demand and supply in a digitizing economy
According to the GxxD reports, data center and related energy consumption is
predicted to increase 500-fold by 2050. Data centers have an inherently heavy energy
demand coming from processing and cooling systems, and their owners typically have
strong ESG mandates, hence they are under heavy pressure for this energy to be
derived from clean sources.


Data center operators are not the only business vying to procure clean electrons
though, the nationwide demand for CPPAs is increasing rapidly. As supply struggles
to keep up with demand, many developers are expanding their teams to develop
renewable energy plants.

From a skills perspective, project development, engineering, project management
and operations between renewable energy and data center assets are remarkably
similar, hence there’s an increasing opportunity for professionals experienced in either
asset type to move between green and digital projects.

This coming together of energy generation and digital infrastructure assets is also
reflected at the investor level. Infrastructure funds who had previously focused on
energy generation assets with strong returns from FIT days are diversifying, with
battery energy storage systems (BESS) and data centers the main areas of interest
from the fund perspective.

Clean energy is only the tip of the iceberg for the power hungry data center industry.
Energy efficiency and energy security are key priorities as well. This drives an increase
in demand for advanced energy management software systems, as well as an increase
in backup power systems that are increasingly in the form of on-site BESS. The
increase of such BTM (behind-the-meter) systems that will also be trading power via
other revenue streams is one factor leading to increased talent demand in our next
growth sector.

Trading gets smart
Over the past five years, Japan’s energy trading landscape has shifted dramatically to
become the world’s third-largest liberalized market. With the recent eight-fold
increase in futures trading on the TOCOM, and outsized growth on the rival EEX
platform, as well as the fact that around 40% of physical power in Japan now trades
on the JEPX spot/wholesale exchange, there’s an increasing interest in market
mechanisms from both domestic and global players.

Add to that the growing complexity of mirroring real-world energy trends (more
weather-reliant renewables and energy storage units in the grid, the appearance of
EVs and demand-response schemes, etc.), and you can see how important analytics,
algorithms, and other digital tools become to help traders make sense (and money!) in
today’s markets.

AI-driven algorithmic trading is clearly on the rise, with global firms experienced in this
from Europe, U.S. or Australia now building out their footprint in the Japanese market.
Domestic players too are getting in on the act with their own systems.

On the talent side, this has led to energy players tapping into new talent pools.
Quants from the finance or rapid trading areas such as FX, data scientists and machine
learning experts from various industries are now in demand across the energy and
power space as firms recognise the need to be more intelligent, faster and more
automated in their trading strategies.

Opportunities for new blood
The merging of GX and DX businesses is a GxxD thing for the talent market! Fresh
ideas in any industry are directly correlated with fresh talent moving in. There was
stagnation before the renewable energy boom, and there was a second phase of
stagnation as large-scale renewable energy development began to plateau.


The digital revolution in the energy sector drives the opportunity to attract new talent,
new ideas and move innovation.

Case study 1: Data science in trading optimisation and aggregation
Titan was retained to build out the initial team for a Japanese player to develop the
trading optimisers for their business that will aggregate and trade power using various
routes to revenue. Due to the large data sets required to predict fluctuations, spreads
and potential trading risks, we were tasked with supporting the hire of multiple data
scientists.

Working with the client, we helped them to craft an attractive story, not only about
their position and company but also about the power market itself as a meaningful
and lucrative industry. As a result, the first recruit we successfully hired was a trilingual
professional quantitative data scientist with experience in risk management in the
insurance industry, as well as pricing strategies in FX, commodity and equity markets.

Case study 2: Large power consumer building out generation capabilities
Over the past six months, Titan has worked with a leading investor and developer of
large, power hungry assets such as data centers and logistics facilities. As with many
such companies, they were under increasing pressure to hit ESG targets, and faced

22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

challenges to procure sufficient clean energy from CPPAs. They decided to launch a
new fund and team that would be dedicated to development of renewable energy
and storage assets for their own consumption.

We worked with them to understand the renewable energy talent market, as well as
design the interview process to allow them to accurately screen professionals from the
renewables industry that they had previously not tapped into. To date, we have
supported them to hire three investment and development professionals who have
acquired secondary market assets and built a large pipeline of greenfield assets, as
well as built out a network of local development partners.

Summary: GxxD developments in the talent market
As the energy business becomes more complex, demand increases, volatility remains
in the market, the need for more data-driven decisions is sure to increase. What we
are seeing in the market at the moment seems to be just the beginning, and the talent
market shifts resulting from the convergence of the energy and digital markets will
provide diverse opportunities for a wider range of professionals than we have seen to
date.

Andrew Statter is a Partner at Titan GreenTech, an executive recruitment agency
focused on the clean energy space.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

APAC / CCS
Asia Pacific could see $15 billion in investment in carbon capture and storage over the
next decade. Rystad Energy said Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia are emerging
CCUS hubs due to the CO2 storage potential in their depleted oil and gas reservoirs.

Australia / Energy transition
Over the next four years the Queensland govt will allocate A$39 billion to its
renewable energy and jobs plan, ensuring that households have access to cleaner
power.

China / Hydropower
In Q1, Three Gorges Corp, the world's largest clean energy corridor, will generate a
total of more than 52,000 GWh of electricity, equivalent to saving 15 million tons of
coal.

China / Natural gas
Russia’s effort to ink a pipeline gas deal with China has stalled; Moscow sees Beijing’s
demands on price and supply to be unreasonable, claims Reuters. China wants a price
close to Russia’s subsidized domestic prices and would only commit to buy a small
fraction of the pipeline’s planned annual capacity of 50 bcm of gas.

India / Natural gas
Sweltering heat is fuelling a surge in the use of gas-fired power in India. LNG imports
are forecast to rise sharply over the next two years. The country's gas-fired power
generation doubled YoY in April and May to 8,900 GWh.

Laos / Electricity exports
According to a report in Nikkei, electricity is Laos' largest export, accounting for about
30% of total exports. More than 70% of the country’s power comes from hydroelectric
sources.

LNG
LNG exports from the U.S. rebounded in May as Freeport LNG, the country's second-
largest exporter, returned to full production; more supplies flowed to Asia, according
to data from LSEG. The U.S. is the world's largest LNG exporter.

Malaysia / China
Petronas and Sinopec inked an MoU to cooperate on the energy value chain. Areas
include investment in upstream, refinery, chemicals, new energy, carbon capture,
utilization and storage, etc. They’ll also explore opportunities in trading LNG, crude
and refined products.

Solar power
Despite a surge in solar power capacity in 2023, a “vast solar potential remains
untapped” as the sunniest countries have the least installed solar capacity, said
24



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Ember, adding that only 14% of global solar capacity installed last year (about 204
GW) were located in countries with solar exposure that’s above the global average.
For example, Japan has 13 times more solar panels per person installed than India.

South Korea / Oil & Gas
Oil and gas prospects identified off the country’s east coast hold "great potential".
The site off the coastal city of Pohang could contain as much as 14 billion barrels of oil
and gas.
