NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Miyagi Pref passes renewable tax plan, will slow land development for solar and wind power
(Japan NRG, July 4)
•  The Miyagi Pref assembly unanimously passed the prefectural proposal to tax solar, wind and
biomass operators that build facilities by tearing down over 0.5 hectares of forest areas. The tax
rate is 20% of operating profit from power operations.
•  The new tax will be introduced in April 2024 following a consultation with the Ministry of Internal

Affairs and Communications. The plan may change if the ministry opposes it.
•  The Miyagi Pref is studying plans to set up Renewable Promotion Zones. Operators there wouldn’t
be taxed.
•  Offshore wind operators won’t be taxed either. There are currently no offshore wind projects in
Miyagi, and the prefecture is keen to attract projects.
•  The tax rate was set high in order to deter land development that conflicts with community
stakeholders. The plan is not positioned as a new source of tax revenue.

•  It will be reviewed after 3-5 years.
•  Renewable operators pay Environment Tax and Development Tax to the prefecture, in addition to
property related taxes and other national taxes.
•  CONTEXT: The new tax will hit onshore wind operators since it would be difficult to build power
stations without tearing down mountain landscape in Miyagi. Some operators have argued more
emissions are reduced from building wind power stations than keeping trees, and if renewable

expansion stops due to the tax, the prefecture will not meet its 2050 net zero goal.
•  Miyagi Pref’s 2030 renewable expansion goal
2021               2030 goal
Renewable demand        2.3 TWh              2.7 TWh

Total power demand      14.4 TWh             11 TWh

• TAKEAWAY: The passing of the local tax bill, just a week after the assembly convened, shocked renewable
operators nationwide as the move is likely to spread. Even if the Ministry of Internal Affairs had blocked the
Miyagi plan, there’d be other municipalities trying different tax ideas, they said. Driven by a shortage of space
for new solar and onshore wind installations, some operators have started to review their business models, by
exploring demand response, EV charging and other mobility services. National renewable expansion plans

have come to a turning point. As possible solutions to break the deadlock, ruling party lawmakers eye
speeding up next-gen perovskite solar tech development and floating offshore wind power planning in EEZ
waters.

NRA approve TEPCO’s plan for Fukushima Daiichi water release, despite opposition
(Nikkei, July 7)
•  The NRA issued a certificate to TEPCO, the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power
Station in Japan, indicating that it has passed the pre-use inspection of facilities related to the

discharge of treated water.
•  The IAEA assessed that the radiation impact of the discharged treated water on people and the
environment is negligible.
•  Local fishermen remain opposed to the discharge. Some countries, including China and Russia,
have also criticized the project. To explain the contents of the IAEA report, the IAEA Director
General Grossi will also visit South Korea to meet with govt officials and members of the

opposition party, which opposes the water release.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
NRA chief won’t meet with Fukushima water release opponents
(Government statement, July 5)
o  The NRA coordination officer is stationed in Fukushima to explain to the community
stakeholders its review findings, chairman Yamanaka said. Unlike the IAEA head Grossi,
Yamanaka has no plan for meetings with the fishermen and other community members.

“There is no request for meetings with me,” he told reporters.
o  The IAEA will open an office in Fukushima to monitor the water release until completion.
o  CONTEXT: The water release will be spread out over several years.



Toyota says battery tech breakthrough can halve unit costs and size, a boost for EVs

(Financial Times, July 4)
●  Toyota recently unveiled a breakthrough in its next-gen batteries, known as solid-state
technology. This will cut by half the cost of batteries used in EVs, as well as reduce their size and
weight. Their cost would be similar or even lower than the lithium ion battery, said Kaita Keiji,
president of Toyota’s R&D center for carbon neutrality.
●  CONTEXT: Lithium ion batteries use liquid or polymer gel electrolytes. Solid-state tech promises
to be a more stable, more efficient battery in terms of charging and recharging, and which also

avoids the flammability risks of liquid batteries.
●  Toyota could start to mass produce EVs with solid-state battery tech by about 2027 or 2028, Kaita
said. Toyota’s recent announcements said that an EV with the new type of battery could charge in
10 minutes to cover a range of 1,200 km.
• TAKEAWAY: Toyota’s comments could have interesting implications for battery raw materials, of which there is
currently a shortage. It might ease the demand for graphite over time, but increase it for lithium metal.
However, the economics of the new tech is not yet clear, and the speed at which Toyota will roll out the

technology will play a role in raw material demand-supply calculations.

AI could help find climate solutions: experts say
(Japan NRG, July 3)
•  Generative AI could help find climate solutions, according to technology analysts speaking at “JX
(Japan Transformation) Live! 2023”, a conference organized by the Japan Association of New

Economy.
•  Climate change will have a larger impact on mankind than ChatGPT, causing natural disasters
comparable to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, said Hirano Miku, the founder of AI startup
Cinnamon.
•  AI will tailor an individual’s information needs. AI can also collect opinions on divisive issues such
as nuclear power, and suggest a solution, said Uchiyama Koki, the CEO of Hottolink, and Ito Joi,

Director for Digital Garage.
•  Japan excels in energy conservation tech and the country’s next growth focus should be power
savings for AI, which is power intensive, said METI Minister Nishimura.
•  CONTEXT: Business leaders, startups, lawmakers, METI Minister and MoE Vice Minister gathered
at “JX Live! 2023” to discuss how digital and green initiatives will propel Japan’s economic growth.
• TAKEAWAY: METI and the MoE are likely to ask companies to provide more data to improve climate decision
making, with or without AI. The performance of generative AI will depend on the data supplied to the system.

Some countries have data localization laws requiring data of local citizens and organizations to remain in local
servers, and allow government access to the data. Japan does not have such a law, and the possibility of
enacting such a law is slim.

focusing on the Yokoyama Dam. Chubu Electric and the MLIT plan to review dam operations and
increase power generation during periods when water outflows do not reach flood levels.

•  Instead of releasing water through flood discharge gates, the excess water was stored and used for
power generation discharge.
•  During the June 28-July 2 trial, the water level was set three meters higher than the flood stage
water level, resulting in about 8.8 MWh of increased power generation. This is part of the MLIT's
efforts to promote "hybrid dams'' that enhance hydroelectric power generation while maintaining
flood control capabilities.
•  CONTEXT: The Ministry plans to expand the project to 72 dams, aiming to add about 20 million

GWh of power generation. The Yokoyama Dam is the first in the Chubu area to test these
methods.
• TAKEAWAY: Until the 1970s -80s, hydropower was Japan’s biggest source of green electricity. The sector has
stagnated since then with few technological improvements or new projects, but the recent push to add
Japan’s renewables capacity is motivating the govt and industry to rethink ways to get more electricity
volumes from the nation’s water resources. For a more detailed look at the sector, see the Analysis section in

the July 3, 2023 report.

Solar PV manufacturers racing to secure germanium from China ahead of Aug 1 deadline
(Japan NRG, July 7)
•  Solar PV products manufacturers are racing to secure as much germanium metal from China before
new export controls take effect, traders told Japan NRG.
•  This week, China’s Commerce Ministry said germanium and gallium metal exports will be subject
to screening as of August 1.

•  Prices are surging. Germanium traded at $2,550/ kg this week, up 8% from January.
•  CONTEXT: China has an 80% share of Japan’s germanium metal imports used for infrared ray
sensing devices, solar PV components and semiconductor chips. China has around 60-70% share
of Japan’s gallium imports, used for chips. Japan has its own gallium production and relies less on
Chinese supplies.
• TAKEAWAY: A fierce exchange of words among officials this year over Chinese rare earths sales overseas

hardly disturbed the market. China says it has no intention to stop germanium and gallium exports, but rather
to tighten control. Nevertheless, traders say the move could hit germanium metal consumers in the defense
sector as China’s supply share is higher than for rare earths.




Idemitsu invests A$48 million in Australian lithium company
(Denki Shimbun, July 5)
•  Idemitsu Kosan invested about A$48 million in Delta Lithium, to increase its stake to 15%.

ANALYSIS

BY JOHN VAROLI

Japanese Companies Eager to Spark the U.S. Energy Transition
Nearly a year has passed since the U.S. government approved the Inflation Reduction
Act, and investments into the country’s energy sector are growing. Of all U.S. allies,
Japan is in the forefront of this trend, with new substantial investments planned in
clean energy, building on many others made over the past decade.

In 2020, foreign direct investment outflow from Japan was $222 billion, making the
country the world’s largest investor. Japan’s investments are focused in the EU and
North America, and the country is the leading direct foreign investor in the U.S, with a
total of $721 billion in 2021 — 14% of the $5 trillion total, according to the
Department of Commerce.

U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates of Japanese companies exported $75 billion worth of
goods in 2020, far ahead of Germany’s $47 billion in second place. About half of
Japan’s investment is in manufacturing, such as the car industry, but new investments
in pharmaceuticals and energy are growing.

While China is another major destination for Japanese investment, concerns over
geopolitical risks have changed the landscape significantly. Also, the White House’s
effort to return manufacturing and supply chains home has complicated business for
Japanese companies which need to import parts and materials from China. Businesses
that seek to expand in the U.S. now need to spend more to build up local supply and
production.

According to the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), over half of Japanese
companies operating in the U.S. cited rising wages as a challenge, as well as rising
logistics costs. This, of course, impacts the bottom line. While profit margins on direct
investment by Japanese companies have been in the double digits in China, in the
U.S. they’ve slumped to less than 5% since 2020.

In the eyes of many Japanese companies, however, those obstacles and challenges
are worth tolerating for one prime reason – most states in the U.S. are seen as mature,
stable markets with a long-established and transparent legal framework that’s
conducive to business growth. Texas is by far the lead destination for Japanese
investment in energy, with Houston serving as the unofficial capital for Japanese
energy companies in North America.


Japan loves tech in the U.S.
Natural gas power generation and LNG development have long been a major focus of
Japanese investment in the U.S., and this trend shows no sign of abating even though
Europeans are now the leading buyers of LNG from the U.S.

JERA, a thermal power and LNG joint venture between TEPCO and Chubu Electric,
plans to invest $935 million through 2030 in U.S. power generation projects. Since
2016, JERA has taken over nearly 3 GW of generation in North America, set over
three U.S. natural gas-fired power plants as part of the Tenaska Gas Thermal IPP

| In 2020, foreign direct investment outflow from Japan was $222 billion, making the |
| --- |
| country the world’s largest investor. Japan’s investments are focused in the |

Project. Also, J-Power has stakes in a dozen U.S. power plants, mostly gas-fired plants
that are less than 20 years old.

New technologies, however, are the essence of the energy transition, and this is the
main opportunity for Japanese investors eager to enter the American energy
transition. A knack for cutting-edge technology has personified Japan in the minds of
many Americans since the early 1980s. While that reputation has weakened in recent
years, ‘green tech’ is precisely where Japan hopes to emerge as a leader in the U.S.
market.

Here’s an overview of some of Japan’s most significant energy transition projects in
the U.S. Some predate the passage of the IRA.


1. Smart Grid, Energy Efficiency and Climate Tech:
a. In early 2022, NEDO and Sumitomo Electric completed a demo project
in California to improve the grid’s power quality, achieving the
establishment of a microgrid on a commercial power distribution
network, operation of a large-scale stationary storage battery, and multi-
use operation in both normal and emergency situations.
b. In May, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) set up a subsidiary, MOL Switch, in the
U.S. Over the next three years it will invest $100 million in startups
working on climate tech focused on decarbonization.
c. Also in May, Hitachi Energy secured a multi-billion yen order of high-
voltage direct current (HVDC) equipment from U.S. renewable energy
developer Pattern Energy. The high voltage source converters will deliver
the power generated at the 3.5-GW SunZia wind project in New Mexico
to Arizona, which is scheduled to start in 2026, via 885 km of HVDC
transmission lines.


2. Energy Storage/ EV batteries: To safeguard energy security, the White House is
stimulating domestic battery production.
a. Toward that goal, Panasonic will expand by 10% its EV battery
production at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, adding a 15th line by
2025. Panasonic also plans a $4 billion lithium-ion EV battery factory
in Kansas, with an initial production capacity of 30 GWh; to start
production in March 2025.
b. Also, six Japanese companies including INPEX, Development Bank
of Japan, and Rakuten Capital invested in TerraWatt Technology that
develops lithium-ion batteries.


3. Solar Power: Japanese companies have made sizable investments in solar power
projects in the U.S., with Texas as the main destination. Companies, such as Kyocera
Solar and Sharp, have long had solar panel manufacturing facilities and develop solar
projects across various states. But in the past three years, Japanese energy companies
have been gobbling up entire solar farms.
a. The most recent was in May when Osaka Gas USA bought a 350 MW
utility scale solar project in Texas from EE North America, a
subsidiary of European Energy. The project will be operational in
2025.

b. Also, J-Power USA, a unit of the Tokyo company, has a 50% stake in
the 400 MW Charger Solar facility in Texas that begins operation this
year.
c. Tokyo Gas Americas has a stake in the 500 MW Aktina Solar Project
in Texas. The deal was Tokyo Gas’ first international solar project
from construction to completion.


4. Wind Power: Japanese companies have also invested in wind power projects in
the U.S., again, with Texas as the lead destination. Sumitomo owns wind farms in
Texas.
a. Kansai Electric has a 49% stake in the 525 MW Aviator Wind Project
in Texas, the company's first renewable energy project in the U.S.
b. Also, Marubeni has an agreement with BP Alternative Energy
Investments (BPAEIL) for development of offshore wind and other
decarbonization projects. BPAEIL already has a net offshore wind
development pipeline of more than 5 GW.


5. Nuclear power:
a. In 2021, NuScale, a U.S. startup maker of SMRs, secured $20 million
from Japan’s IHI Corp. Also, as part of its relationship with Fluor
Corp, NuScale’s majority investor, Japan’s JGC HD will invest $40
million in NuScale and partner with Fluor on the deployment of
NuScale’s SMRs.
b. Meanwhile, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries will cooperate with the U.S. government and TerraPower
on an advanced nuclear power venture founded by Bill Gates; the
goal is to build an advanced sodium fast reactor in Wyoming.
Terrapower had initially explored building the experimental nuclear
reactor with China National Nuclear Corp.
c. In March 2022, Holtec signed an agreement with the U.S. division of
Mitsubishi Electric to design and engineer the digital instrumentation
and control systems for Holtec’s SMR-160 modular reactor.


6. Hydrogen power: Japanese companies are investing in hydrogen-related
projects in the U.S., including in production, storage, and transportation
infrastructure.
a. In June, JERA began co-firing hydrogen at a gas-fired power plant in
the U.S., with plans to achieve a ratio of 40%. Unit 6 of the 972-MW
Linden gas-fired power plant in New Jersey mixes a by-product gas
that includes hydrogen supplied from nearby oil refineries, with
natural gas to generate electricity. This is JERA’s first project to
implement hydrogen co-firing in a thermal power plant. The
company’s co-firing strategy for Japan currently focuses on ammonia
co-firing at coal-fired power stations.


7. Biofuels:
a. Sojitsu Corp of America is investing in Next Renewable Fuels to build
a plant in Oregon to make renewable fuels from used cooking oil

with HEFA technology. Annual production will be 2.8 billion liters of
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel. Plant
construction and port facilities are estimated at $7.5 billion.
b. Also, last month Asahi Kasei and Mitsui announced a plan for a
supply system for bio-methanol made in the U.S. Mitsui will acquire
renewable natural gas (RNG) from local waste landfills.

In the coming years, and probably decades, the ‘special relationship’ between Japan
and the U.S. looks set to grow and prosper. In the wake of the tectonic geopolitical
shift since the start of the Russian-Ukraine conflict in early 2022, Tokyo and
Washington need each other more than ever in order to bolster their economies and
guarantee energy security.

The common goals of the energy transition are serving to further compound this
alliance on both a geopolitical and commercial level. As both countries revive their
industrial strategies and pair energy development with that of key and sensitive
sectors like semiconductors, the current investment numbers feel more like the floor
and not the ceiling of this relationship.

COLUMN:        ENERGY      JOBS    IN  JAPAN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Energy Storage Market Special - Hiring in the BESS boom

Energy Storage projects are on the rise in Japan, with many players looking to
capitalize on the METI subsidies announced in 2021, and the necessity to co-locate
ESS with new renewable assets in certain areas, namely Hokkaido. Does this mean
that there is a booming talent market in the ESS market? The answer is both yes and
no, and we can get a better understanding of this by looking at the capabilities of the
players in the ESS market.


Players and capabilities
A. Main market players are renewable developers, both multinational and domestic,
with experience in other asset types, most commonly PV solar players with a
track record in Japan.

As the FIT for PV dries up – large-scale projects have faced challenges such as
land scarcity, local opposition and declining economics – many developers have
shifted their focus to ESS projects. These players already have strong capabilities
in project origination and development. As ESS projects tend to require smaller
parcels of land, these early stages of development are relatively easy to cover
with existing human resources.

In most cases, they employ electrical engineers, who are able to perform tasks
such as system design, working with TSO for grid connection, etc. However, the
trading and power markets are where these firms tend to lack expertise. Most of
their projects in PV have been subsidized by FIT, and they have little or no
experience in trading their power, and thus, they need expertise to help
maximize sales.


B. Next are experienced global ESS system developers and power utilities. Storage
markets in the UK, U.S. (certain states) and Australia are further advanced than in
Japan. Successful firms in those markets see the potential in Japan, and there
have been multiple market entries in recent months. Conversely to our first group
of players, these global firms such as Eku, Akaysha Energy or even Tesla have
experience in operating and trading power in their home markets. When they
enter the Japanese market, they tend to have more local focused needs, for
example technical development and talent who are strong with partnerships and
policy.


C. Finally, there are large Japanese companies, such as trading houses and utilities.
We see the least mid-career hiring for ESS in the large Japanese firms, with the
reason that they have a broad spectrum of existing talent. Often, they invest in
and partner in ESS projects overseas, gaining experience that they bring home.

Many of these firms have had a power retail arm, or have been early movers in
PPA offtake projects, both of which give them a firm understanding of the

21

commercial aspects. Mid-career movement in the large Japanese players has
been observed on the technical side. Trading houses are the prime example -
with strong commercial, development and financial resources. However, often
lacking in technical expertise, they’ve been hiring strong talent with experience
in battery technology manufacturers.

Does this mean that there is a lack of opportunity in ESS? No, we are seeing a
demand for different talent and skill sets than we’d normally see in the
development and operation of generation assets. As the majority of market
players can repurpose existing resources to cover aspects of their ESS business,
hiring takes more of a ‘fill the gaps’ approach, as opposed to development of full
new teams.


Keeping lean
The other reason for lower volume of ESS opportunities is the smaller scale of projects
at this early stage. For example, Pacifico Energy’s first two stand-alone ESS projects
recently launched; their capacity is 2MW/ 8MWh each. The company is a developer
with a track record of very large scale PV generation projects. Illustrating the points
above, they achieved this with only a couple of specific hires for the ESS team, while
relying on existing development and engineering capabilities. As both project volume
and scale increase, we expect this to change.


Quality > volume
In contrast to the PV boom of a decade ago, the market today does not expect to rely
on subsidies long-term. Therefore, new market entrants must start from day one with a
business plan to succeed in an open market.

This has led to firms taking more care with their OPEX, which includes hiring. The
result is a focus on building small, lean, high quality teams rather than hiring en masse
and grabbing land left, right and center, and collecting FIT ID’s as if they were
Pokemon to put their names on as much pipeline as possible.


Summary
The ESS market in Japan is one of the next large growth sectors, which is already
reflected in an increase of hiring across the space. In contrast to the scale of hiring
from outside the industry during the PV boom, and to a lesser extent in the offshore
wind industry over the past few years, the approach by the market has been more
measured. It is still early days, and the scale of stand-alone projects is small when
compared to global markets; hence, this is an area we expect to accelerate in the near
future.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ Critical raw materials
China will restrict exports of gallium and germanium, which are used in computer
chips and other components. This raises concerns of export limits of other materials,
notably rare earths, whose production China dominates, and which are vital for the
energy transition.

EU/ Critical raw materials
Aluminum joined the list of minerals and metals covered by the Critical Raw Materials
Act, which seeks to safeguard supplies to compete with the U.S and China. The World
Bank has identified aluminum as a "high-impact" metal in all existing and potential
green energy technologies from solar to geothermal, as well as in EVs.

EVs
Tesla shares, which have more than doubled in the first half of 2023, are set to extend
their rally after the company beat expectations, delivering 466,000 vehicles between
April and June, up 10.4% from the previous quarter and 83.5% YoY.

India/ Oil imports
Indian refiners have begun paying for some oil imports from Russia in yuan, as
Western sanctions force Moscow and its customers to find alternatives to the dollar for
settling payments. India is now the largest buyer of seaborne Russian oil.

LNG
Surging EU demand for LNG to offset the loss of Russian gas has pushed prices
beyond the reach of buyers in south and Southeast Asia, fueling coal use – this was
the message at the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur this week. Europe’s thirst
for LNG has taken some permanent supply from Asia, plus all the new supply from the
U.S.

Netherlands/ Energy infrastructure
Canada's OMERS and Dutch investor APG will buy Kenter, the Dutch infrastructure
solutions firm. The deal values Kenter at close to €700 million. It specializes in the
energy transition, selling products such as transformers, switchgear, and meters.

Offshore drilling
The number of offshore drilling vessels recovered to pre-pandemic levels, rising by
45% from a low in October 2020. Wood Mackenzie forecasts offshore exploration and
drilling to grow 20% by 2025. Upstream oil and gas have returns of about 15% to
20%, while most renewables projects deliver up to 8%.

Oil prices
Saudi Arabia will extend the one million bpd production cut announced last month for
July into August, while Russia will make a voluntary supply cut of an additional
500,000 bpd next month. Oil prices rose slightly on the news. Having risen above
$130 a barrel last March, oil now trades closer to $75 a barrel.

Russia/ gas
Gazprom threatened sanctions against Ukraine's Naftogaz, saying it was not
"constructive" in overseeing Russian gas transit to Europe. The company also said
that it won’t take part in international legal cases initiated by Naftogaz to recover $5
billion awarded to it by an arbitration court as compensation for assets expropriated in
Crimea.

Wind power
Siemens Energy will set up a task force to investigate deepening problems at its crisis-
ridden wind turbine division. The problems, which were revealed in June, caused
Siemens Energy's shares to plunge by 37%.
