Nuclear regulator chief says safety cannot be compromised for early restarts
(Japan NRG, March 16)
•  In response to rising calls among lawmakers to speed up nuclear plant inspection and restarts, the
Nuclear Regulation Authority chairman, Fuketa Toyoshi, said there won’t be any compromise on
nuclear safety. The NRA was established not to repeat the mistakes that lead to the Fukushima
meltdown. In order to speed up inspections, there’s much that plant operators can do, he added.
•  CONTEXT: Ruling party lawmakers formally asked METI minister Hagiuda Koichi to speed up the

processes to restart idled nuclear power plants. The NRA is independent from METI and falls under
the MoE.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Nuclear Regulation Authority chief says underground small modular reactor is a possibility
(Japan NRG, March 16)
o  Nuclear Regulation Authority chairman Fuketa said building a small modular reactor

(SMR) underground is under discussion because it’s more resilient against earthquakes
and improves performance of cooling systems. It will also be protected from airborne
missile attacks. However, an underground SMR has cost issues.

Government may relax competition regulations to help businesses decarbonize
(Nikkei, March 16)
•  Corporate alliances are essential if Japanese industry is to develop the technologies and make the
necessary investment to become carbon neutral. The government is considering relaxing anti-trust
regulations as they apply to these sectors.
•  METI plans to establish an expert panel to debate amendments to legislation.
•  The Netherlands, Australia, Greece, Germany and the EC have relaxed competition legislation for
the renewable energy sector.
•  Japan has a precedent for such measures. In 2001, the Japan Fair Trade Commission issued

guidelines for recycling collaboration among competing appliance producers.

Several utilities ask METI to reverse hydropower reserve to boost profits
(Denki Shimbun, March 14)
•  Chubu Electric Power Milize, Hokuriku Electric, and Shikoku Electric applied to METI for reversal
of the drought reserve, claiming that soaring wholesale electricity and fuel prices justify this
emergency action under current law.
•  If approved by the end of this fiscal year, all three utilities can expect improved financial results.
Not since 2014 has a utility asked for this measure.
•  The drought reserve is a system based on the former Electricity Business Law to mitigate
fluctuations in income and expenditures caused by fluctuations in the amount of electricity
received from hydropower stations.



Kawasaki Heavy develops hydrogen co-firing large-size gas engines
(New Energy Business News, March 18)
•  Kawasaki Heavy Industries’ new combustion technology provides stable operation of large 5 MW
or more gas engines, by mixing hydrogen with natural gas at a ratio of up to 30%. Kawasaki is
Japan’s first gas engine manufacturer to achieve this.
•  Compared to burning natural gas, this tech reduces CO2 emissions by 1,000 tons/ year.

•  The new model is based on a conventional gas engine and can be used for hydrogen co-firing with
minimal modifications. Gas engine modification and the market launch of the new hydrogen co-
firing model will be available from 2025.



Japan tests domestic bio jet fuel in 60-minute flights, including with passengers

(New Energy Business News, March 18)
•  A low-wing turboprop twin-engine aircraft owned and operated by Asia Aerospace made a 60-
minute flight fueled in part with domestic bio jet fuel.
•  The flight started and ended at Yao Airport in Osaka. The diesel fuel employed was the Susteo
brand developed by Euglena, which tries to create sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by employing
used cooking oils and fats derived from microalgae. The bio fuel is blended with petroleum-based
jet fuel.
•  The test is part of "Bio-Jet Fuel Production Technology Development Project / Establishment of

Supply Chain Model through Demonstration and Development of Microalgae Infrastructure
Technology,” funded by NEDO.
•  CONTEXT: Euglena’s bio jet fuel, Susteo, has also been tested on a charter flight by Fuji Dream
Airlines, which operates the Embraer ERJ175 jet model. The short 60-minute flight carried 77
passengers.



Taiwan’s Foxconn to enlist 100 Japanese companies in EV drive

PM pledges to work with businesses to pass on price increases properly
(Nikkei, March 14)
•  PM Kishida is concerned that small businesses must find a way to figure the rising price of oil and
other commodities into the price of their own goods.
•  There’ll be more inspectors to work with small businesses and their pricing.



Japan-US nuclear collaboration lacks strategic direction

(Nikkei, March 16)
•  CONTEXT: This is an editorial by the Nikkei Shimbun’s editorial committee.
•  The Japan Atomic Energy Agency and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries agreed to collaborate with U.S.-
based TerraPower to develop fast breeder reactor technology.
•  Russia is also investing heavily in fast breeder reactors, so the latest move does have significance
for the Japan-U.S. alliance.
•  However, the project will require enormous investment, and the technology is unlikely to be

commercially viable until at least the 2050s.
•  Like the ill-fated Japanese Monju reactor, TerraPower’s reactor will also be cooled by molten
sodium, a difficult material because it explodes on contact with water.
•  While the U.S. side will benefit from Japan’s experience on the Monju project, it’s unclear how the
project will benefit Japan.
•  This project probably won’t be realized because Japan’s lack of commitment on nuclear energy
means skilled nuclear engineers are few and far between.



ENEOS and Idemitsu turn to delivery robots to offset falling gasoline demand
(Nikkei, March 16)
•  In a bid to remain profitable despite falling gasoline demand, ENEOS and Idemitsu are leveraging

their service station chains to offer more diverse services.
•  ENEOS trialed meal delivery that uses service stations as hubs for delivery robots.
•  Idemitsu trialed a “mobile MRI” service where an MRI machine in a trailer offers brain checkups to
those living far from a hospital.
•  Falling demand and aggressive pricing by U.S. chain Costco has forced many Japanese-owned
petrol stations to close.
•  Consumers pay ¥15/ liter less than the national average at Costco service stations, which

purportedly operate at a loss.


One-Dot Wrap:
•  Toyota Motor has developed a "hydrogen storage module" integrating multiple 70MPa plastic
high-pressure hydrogen tanks for automobiles, with safety devices such as hydrogen sensors and
automatic shut-off valves. (Kankyo Business, March 17)
•  Since it’s now mandatory for solar power generation facilities with an output of 10 kW or more to

have fire insurance and earthquake insurance, the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy
posted insurance products sold by private companies on its website in order to help operators
access the information. (Kankyo Business, March 16)

Earthquake sends 12 power plants offline
(Nikkei, Japan NRG, March 17)
•  METI said the 7.4 earthquake on March 16 off the Fukushima coast caused 12 thermal power
plants — operated by the Tohoku Electric and JERA — to shut temporarily, removing 6 GW of
capacity from the grid. Also, 22 hydroelectric power stations temporarily shut.
•  In the early hours of March 17, to mitigate shortages, the Organization for Cross-regional
Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO) instructed Hokkaido Electric to share power with

Tohoku Electric.
•  Unit 6 of JERA's Hirono thermal power station will be operational after March 18.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Tokyo Grid asks users to limit power use
(Company Statement, March 18)
o  TEPCO Grid, the operator for the central Kanto region around Tokyo, asked users to start

limiting power use (“setsuden” in Japanese).
o  The local grid is facing “severe power supply and demand situation due to the
continuous shutdown of some power plants in eastern Japan” after last week’s quake and
also due to a recent drop in temperatures.
o  Even with additional supply from grids in other regions, the supply-demand is expected
to be extremely tight around 9pm to 10pm, the grid operator said, warning that outages

were possible.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
OCCTO widens power sharing orders to help northeast region
(Japan NRG, March 18)
o  OCCTO expanded power sharing in order to send surplus electricity to the northeast
Tohoku area to help cover shortages.

o  On March 18, between 9am and noon, OCCTO asked Hokkaido Electric to send 24.6
MW, Chubu Electric to send 250 MW, and Kansai Electric to send 250 MW.
o  Power prices jumped to the highest in about a year. The LNG price benchmark for Asia
was in the low-to-mid $30s.
o  JERA, the nation’s top thermal power utility by capacity, promptly sought to buy several
LNG cargoes on the spot market to secure alternative fuel as its Hirono coal-fired power
plant was idled due to the quake.

o  2 million homes in the Tokyo area had no power for a few hours after the quake.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has several thousand earthquakes each year, though most are too small to be felt. The
country has experienced major tremors in the last decade — Fukushima in 2011, the Kyushu area in 2016, and
Hokkaido in 2018, which caused widespread disruption and damages. In the near term, the concerns are about
energy supply and power prices, already elevated due to high natural gas and coal costs. This recent quake is
a reminder of the need to build resilience into energy systems, whether gas, wind, nuclear or other. As

explained in previous Japan NRG issues, we expect government spending to focus more and more on energy
system resilience, as well as energy security, all of which ultimately mean rising power prices.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO will analyze the earthquake’s effect on its reactors
(NHK, March 17)
o  TEPCO observed an increase in pressure in the containment vessel of Unit 1 of its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station after the March 16 quake. The pressure inside the
vessel subsequently dropped to below pre-quake levels.

o  While no increase in radioactivity at the site was measured, TEPCO is investigating
whether any air leaked out of the containment vessel.
o  TEPCO also observed a drop in the water level in a tank connected to the spent fuel pool
attached to unit two. While cooling systems were temporarily shut, TEPCO says cooling
was recommenced a few hours later.



METI to revise tender criteria for offshore wind power operators
(Nikkei, March 18)
•  METI will revise the criteria for selecting offshore wind power generation projects via public
auctions. Until now, METI said that price was the main criteria, thereby incentivizing lowest-cost
bids. Going forward, however, the government will also give weight to how soon a project can

begin operating.
•  The ministry will soon discuss the details with its expert panels. The evaluation criteria for bids will
be changed by the end of this year.
•  The bid deadline for projects off the Akita prefecture coast was postponed.
• TAKEAWAY: As Japan NRG forecasted on Jan. 17, 2022, auctions are on hold due to the offshore wind
industry’s anger at the first tender results late last year. Ministry action to appease bigger Japanese and

foreign players was inevitable, but it leaves the government in a precarious position since it doesn’t want
offshore wind project prices to escalate. Any pause for a redrawing of the rules will push back the start of
projects that haven’t yet completed the bidding process, putting into doubt the 2030 target for wind energy.



Power grids forecast impact from storage batteries on curbing electricity output
(Japan NRG, March 14)
•  Power grids forecast how storage battery systems that store redundant solar and wind power will
mitigate output curbs of variable renewables.
•  Output curb mitigation rate (%)

•  The base assumption was that battery systems can store up to 10% of total area power demand,
and can accommodate charging and recharging cycles of six hours, which is more enhanced
compared to current systems designed for two-hour cycles. Output curbs typically last six hours.
• TAKEAWAY: There may be over expectation on the capability of battery storage systems. One member of
METI’s power and gas working group said the current battery systems may be useful for adjusting supply

shortfalls on a daily basis, which typically take one or two hours of discharging. It also takes time to recharge
the batteries. Some argue that it’s also risky to position storage batteries as an emergency power source since
they could be recharging at the very moment when power is needed.



Aker and Mainstream Power take stake in Japan offshore wind project
(Company Statements, March 14)
•  Aker Offshore Wind will join Mainstream Renewable Power to take an initial 50% stake in

Progression Energy’s 800 MW floating offshore wind project in Japan. This is a well-formed, early-
stage opportunity.
•  The three companies combine highly complementary capabilities and experience. Progression
Energy has a team in Japan with experience in engaging stakeholders such as fishing unions and
securing permits for its multiple projects.
• TAKEAWAY: Floating offshore wind is still at an early stage in Japan, but the country’s energy policy has
identified this segment as the more promising of wind power technologies. For a detailed overview of Japan’s

plan for offshore wind, see this week’s Analysis section.



Japan to consider new police unit for guarding nuclear plants: PM Kishida
(Asia Nikkei, March 15)
•  Japan might create a police unit to protect the country's nuclear plants, PM Kishida said, following
Russia's takeover of Ukrainian nuclear facilities. There’s a growing interest in Japan
regarding safety at nuclear plants, he said.
•  CONTEXT: The PM reacted to Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear

plants, which ignited a fire at the latter’s training facility.
• TAKEAWAY: The Fukui Prefecture, which is home to the most reactors of any prefecture in Japan, already
operates a police unit for nuclear plant protection. In effect, all the nuclear plants nationwide have some kind
of police protection. PM Kishida’s comments show a desire to ward off unease among lawmakers and the
public over the safety of nuclear facilities.

• An attack on a nuclear plant was considered off-limits in war. Russia’s attack on the Ukrainian facility, whether
an error or a scare tactic, has reignited concerns in Japan about “what if” its own nuclear power plants face an
attack. The monthly FACTA covered the issue and concluded that the “era of Atoms for Peace is over”. The
popular weekly, Bunshun, ran a story last week in which a top Nikkei editor alleged the Ukrainian nuclear plant
attack was staged to provoke a global outcry against Russia. While Bunshun couched these allegations as

conspiracy theories, it shows the issue’s delicacy. On top of it all, Russia is a major reactor vendor globally.
• While high energy prices have impacted the Japanese public’s attitude towards nuclear restarts, the Ukrainian
plant attack will be used by the anti-nuclear lobby. The road to restarts has grown more complicated.

Japanese utilities look for alternatives to Russian LNG fearing disruptions
(Mainichi, March 18)
•  Japanese gas and electric utilities seek alternatives to Russian natural gas, fearing delays due to
U.S. and European sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or that Russia might cut back
on supplies in retaliation.
•  Some local gas companies are highly dependent on Russia and seek to establish a system to

ensure a stable supply to customers.
•  About half of Hiroshima Gas’s purchased LNG comes from Sakhalin. If shipments are halted, the
impact will be great. The company will consider LNG from other countries, such as Indonesia, or
expand the supply from other companies.
•  Hiroshima Gas and Tokyo Gas both said they are following the developments closely.
•  Chairman of the Japan Gas Association said domestic firms will set up a flexible system allowing
them to cooperate, including the sharing of relevant information.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Few alternatives to Russian LNG, says Osaka Gas
(Asahi Shimbun, March 18)
o  Osaka Gas CEO Fujiwara Masataka sees few supply alternatives to Russian gas.
o  Osaka Gas buys most of its LNG on long-term agreements with little flexibility.



Volatile commodities get in the way of batteries
(Japan NRG, Mar. 17)
•  The London Metal Exchange resumed nickel futures trading on March 16 after suspending it March
8 on soaring prices triggered by China’s Tsingshan group. The LME also set a new trading limit to

control sharp price moves.
•  The price dropped to $40,000/ ton, from a record $100,000/ ton last week.
•  CONTEXT: Nickel is used for lithium-ion-batteries, the mainstream EV, as well as grid storage
batteries.
•  Meanwhile, prices of vanadium pentoxide, used for electrodes of the vanadium redox flow
batteries (VRFB), jumped 35% this month to $12-12.50/ lb. European buyers rushed to secure
supplies before sanctions disrupt Russian exports.

•  Some experts see VRFB as a solution to prevent renewable output curbs and a replacement to the
current lithium-ion storage systems. However, vanadium supply is more limited than nickel.
Vanadium pentoxide prices need to stay at around $5/ lb or less to make VRFB systems
commercially viable.
• TAKEAWAY: Parliament will discuss energy law amendments to recognize storage batteries as a source of
power that can be connected to the grid. Technologies need to catch up fast as current lithium-ion cell

systems, which can recharge a car, don’t have capacity large enough to satisfy the public’s needs. VRFB
systems feature higher storage capacity in a small volume while generating zero emission.

• Vanadium pentoxide it trading at a third of its record high, and efforts to secure alternative supply sources
have begun. One possibility is recovering vanadium from industrial waste. ANRE has reached out to Australia
to reduce the dependency on China. In January, Fukuoka-based LE Systems partnered with Australian miner
Technology Metals, providing them the technology to extract vanadium from industrial waste.




Japan’s Feb crude oil imports jump 13.2%; LNG, coal fall
(Japan NRG, March 16)
•  Japan’s crude oil imports in February jumped 13.2%, to 12.9 million kiloliters, while LNG imports
were down 11.9% to 7.1 million tons, and coal by 3.2% to 9.5 million tons, according to preliminary
customs data.



Japan’s LNG stocks rebound to 1.72 million tons

(Japan NRG, Mar. 17)
•  Japan’s LNG stocks rebounded to 1.72 million tons on March 13, up from 1.47 million tons a week
ago. The stocks at the end of March in 2021 were 2.41 million tons, and the four-year average was
2.19 million tons.



Will copper be the next oil? Mitsubishi and Sumitomo benefit from surging demand
(Shukan Economist, March 14)
•  According to the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC), global copper
production stood at 21 million metric tons in 2019.
•  The recent boom in EVs and wind power has increased demand for copper. However, the
investment required to enter the market caps supply.
•  Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsubishi Materials will benefit from the copper boom. Mitsubishi will invest

¥30 billion in 2020-2026 to boost manufacturing capacity.
•  Sumitomo Metal Mining, which has interests in copper exploration, manufacture and processing,
also stands to benefit.



ENEOS signs up four more firms to carbon-neutral LNG contracts
(Sekiyu Tsushin, March 18)
•  ENEOS signed a “carbon neutral” LNG (CNLNG) sales and purchase agreement with Kamaishi
Gas, Hanamaki Gas, Mizusawa Gas, and Morioka Gas, all of which operate city gas businesses in
Iwate Prefecture.
•  ENEOS began selling CNLNG in November last year.

ANALYSIS

18 Projects Aiming to Help Japan Transform
Into an Offshore Wind Powerhouse

Japan has been slow to embrace wind energy. Two decades since the very first
developments, the country still has less than 5 GW of wind power generation, almost
all of it onshore. That’s a fifth of the UK, another island nation with half the population
and GDP.

Since the commitment to decarbonization made in October 2020, however, the
government has embraced wind power as one of its top priorities for the future
energy mix. Most of the government’s plans center on development of wind
generation offshore. Still, the depth of the waters around Japan makes today’s top
commercial turbines, which are fixed to the sea floor, less effective.

That’s why Japan has embarked on an ambitious program not only to catch up with
European peers in offshore wind, but also to develop floating offshore wind turbines
that would make better use of its strong sea winds.

The differences between a wind turbine installation fixed to the sea floor and one that
floats are not trivial and extend to manufacturing, transportation, and assembly, as
well as operations.

Below is the plan of how Japan’s public and private actors aim to get ahead in floating
offshore wind.

BASED ON MATERIAL OF
SHIN ENERGY SHIMPO

Planning for success
Japan’s efforts in wind are masterminded by the state research institute, NEDO, via its
¥2-trillion Green Innovation Fund. NEDO launched a ¥120 billion (~$1.1 billion)
program to cut costs in power generation, especially in floating turbine technologies.
The first phase of the program will focus on 18 projects split into four areas:
•  Development of next-generation wind turbines
•  Lowering cost of manufacture and installation for floating structures
•  Developing electrical systems best-suited to offshore wind
•  Offshore wind project operation and maintenance (O&M)

The total allocated for R&D in Phase 1 is ¥34.5 billion. Almost half of that, ¥15 billion,
will go to R&D for next-generation wind turbines; while about a third (¥10 billion) will
support the second of the four focus areas.

In terms of timeframe, turbine R&D will require five years, according to NEDO’s plans.
Other areas are expected to achieve results in three years.

By 2030, the public-private program aims to have the cost of power from fixed-
bottom wind turbines drop to ¥8-¥9/ kWh, while the manufacturing costs of floating
turbines should allow the technology to be commercially viable.

The program envisions Japanese firms collaborating with global manufacturers to
achieve high-quality mass-production of wind turbines, next-generation generators,
equipment that can withstand typhoons and lightning, and the development of blades
for low-wind-speed regions. The goals are to make competitive wind power
generation tech for both the Japan and Asian markets.

As production volumes ramp up, Japan expects the cost of manufacture to drop and
the run rate of the equipment to improve.

The high stability of the TLP method, characterized by its submarine foundation and
tension mooring, makes it possible to mount a 15 MW-class wind turbine, which is
likely to become the mainstream in the future, on a compact floating structure. The
mooring cable occupies only 1/1,000th of the sea floor surface compared to other
mooring methods. This would help minimize disruption on fishing and ship
operations.

JERA will conduct TLP monitoring at the demonstration site and establish the design
of power generation facilities, while Mitsui Ocean Development will develop the
floating and mooring systems, Toyo Construction will build the foundations, and
Furukawa Electric will make the transmission system.

The power and engineering firms will work together, forming a council that will direct
the work to address common issues to floating offshore wind power systems. The
structures need to be able to withstand constant bending and twisting of cables, as
well as extreme weather and ocean conditions such as typhoons, storms and swells.
Other key technologies under development are high-voltage dynamic cables, floating
offshore substations, and conversion stations. The idea of grouping the engineering
firms with the utilities is that the former can propose technological solutions that the
latter will immediately examine from a practical and commercial perspective.

The focus is on smart O&M that absorbs digital innovations not only to improve
efficiency of energy generation by collecting and analyzing data, but also to find
better solutions that can protect the health of offshore wind equipment against the
elements: lightning strikes, typhoons, and other natural events specific to the Japan
and Asian markets.

Kansai Electric, for example, is examining several types of drones and will develop
devices so that they can conduct external inspection of floating wind power facilities;
carry out testing of down conductors (equipment that safely discharges lightning
current to the ground); and inspect blades. New tech will be mixed with existing
systems like GPS to track the real time location of floating structures. The use of
drones should speed up inspections and cut the downtime for equipment.

TEPCO Renewable Power and Toshiba plan to use sensors and remotely operated
vehicles (ROVs), as well as drones, for monitoring of floating structures and mooring
cables.

Automation of the offshore industry will continue. At a late stage, Japan’s offshore
wind program has plans to create robots that can inspect inside the nacelle, the part
of the wind turbine inside of which all the main engine components sit. Early checks
can prevent wear and tear from causing damage, and overall reduce O&M costs.

Japan certainly has the technical and engineering prowess to bring all these offshore
wind power plans to fruition. The question is whether the government will have the
will and resources to see these plans through over the course of this decade, which is
what will be necessary to forge a domestic offshore wind sector that is profitable and
sustainable. NEDO’s blueprint is just the crucial first step toward that goal.

CCUS: a Technological Gamble for Japan’s Decarbonization Goals

Japan is a strong proponent of adapting existing energy systems to meet
decarbonization goals, and arguably its biggest gamble is on an emerging set of
technologies that seek to capture CO2 and then either store or recycle it.

Carbon capture, usage and storage technology (CCUS) potentially allows Japan to
meet net carbon neutrality commitments by 2050, while retaining thermal power
generation to provide reliable baseload power. CCUS technology should be available
for certain applications by 2030, and to be widely used in the power generation and
chemical industries by 2050.

Major Japanese industrial corporations are already researching and experimenting
with the technology in pilot projects supported by state subsidies. However, the
technology only appears financially viable for industrial use when coupled with carbon
taxation at levels much higher than today’s. The technology also needs to be
demonstrated at scale in Japan.






























19


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

CCUS Technology and Its Applications in Japan
CCUS refers to several technologies that aim to capture CO2 before it’s emitted into
the atmosphere or to capture it directly from the air, transport it and either
permanently store it or use it to create products.

One strategic approach of the Basic Energy Plan is to keep using thermal generation,
but decarbonize it by either adding hydrogen and ammonia to the fuel mix, or by
using carbon capture at the power plants. METI’s Fifth Basic Energy Plan issued in July
2018, already emphasized the research and development of CO2 capture, as well as
its effective utilization or storage, with a commercialization targeted for 2020.

Carbon recycling was included in the Green Growth Strategy in 2020. Those
technologies are able to receive financial support from the Green Innovation Fund,
which targets R&D projects for the capture and separation of CO2 from gas thermal
power plants, starting from FY2022 and until at least FY2030.

CCUS is seen as a natural option for oil and gas companies, and INPEX, JAPEX and
ENEOS in Japan have incorporated it into their growth strategies. They’d like to use
the technology to reduce both Scope 1 and 3 emissions, applying it to upstream and
downstream assets and also offering it to industrial clients that burn their oil and gas.

Leading industries are especially keen on CCUS. Taiheiyo Cement Corp. is conducting
R&D to apply CCUS to production. Meanwhile engineering and construction
companies Shimizu Corp., Chiyoda Corp. and Taisei Corp. would like to offer the
technology to customers.

According to a report by the Yano Research Institute in 2021, the Japanese CCUS and
carbon recycling market is worth about ¥2 billion, and is expected to grow to ¥160
billion in 2030 and ¥480 billion by 2050.


The Hurdles to CCUS Deployment in Japan
CCUS technology is still in its infancy and Japan doesn’t yet have any such large-scale
project. Oil and gas companies, such as INPEX and JAPEX, are considering integrated
CCUS projects - with CO2 captured from upstream activities before being transported
and stored in depleted oil and gas fields, or used in methanation, for example.

Despite having pledged net carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050,
and announcing CCUS as a strategic pillar to achieve this, the two companies have yet
to provide any technological/cost roadmap.

The question of CCUS’s cost is rarely discussed by industrial players. However, an
advisor from INPEX said that future CCUS activities at its offshore Ichthys gas field
would only make financial sense with CO2 priced at $40/ ton or above. The project is
planned for the late 2020s. METI published some CCUS cost estimates for thermal
power plants, which it says will add ¥7 to ¥9/ kWh for coal plants and ¥3 to ¥4/ kWh
for gas plants.

CO2 storage capacity is another possible limitation for CCUS in Japan. The Global
CCS Institute estimated in 2019 that Japan’s storage capacity was about 14,000
million tons, while annual CO2 emissions are ~1,100 million tons per year. The
development of carbon recycling technologies is therefore high on METI’s roadmap.

20

METI views CCUS as essential to reach the 2050 net carbon neutrality target, but
there are several hurdles, in particular the costs of CAPEX, along with OPEX and
associated energy consumption. There’s also the issue of CO2 transport and storage.

Support from METI focuses on developing low-cost CO2 separation and capture and
transportation methods by vessels for liquified CO2. Those technologies necessary for
CO2 separation, capture & storage should be ready by 2030 and deployed by 2040.

As for CO2 recycling, METI only published a crude roadmap for development of the
necessary technologies in the 2020s, as well as cost reduction in the 2030s and full
adoption in chemicals production, methanation and concrete production after 2040.


Current Projects and Players
While there’s no commercial CCUS application in Japan so far, several pilot projects
are operational. With METI’s support, Kansai Power, Kawasaki Heavy Industry and the
Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth are running a CCS
demonstration project at the Maizaru thermal power plant using solid absorbent.

A storage project by Japan CCS K.K. has been running since FY2012 in Tomakomai,
Hokkaido. It stored 300,000 tons of CO2 under high pressure in the harbor’s seabed.
Construction was completed in 2015 and storage in 2019. Since then, it has been in
the monitoring phase.

Hitachi Zosen, with Ministry of Environment financing, has a methanation project using
green hydrogen and CO2 captured from a waste incinerator. Sekisui Chemical is
conducting a similar project, also subsidized by the MoE, producing syngas from
green hydrogen and CO2 captured from a waste incinerator. Kawasaki Heavy Industry
is working on a solid absorbent material to capture CO2 from low CO2 concentration
gases with a low energy process.

In addition, a consortium of 18 industrial and academic entities was created to
develop and implement CCS technologies in Japan. Members include Toshiba,
Chiyoda, Mitsubishi Material, Taisei Corp., INPEX, Mizuho and the University of Tokyo.


Looking Ahead
METI sees CCUS as a cornerstone of its decarbonization strategy, and is both
supporting the development of associated technologies and putting together a
framework for their development and commercialization.

Several Japanese industrial players are also betting on the potential of CCUS and are
participating in internal R&D or joining pilot projects, with the goal of reducing their
own carbon emissions and/or commercializing their CCUS solutions. However, as of
today, it’s difficult to separate the hype from the technology’s genuine realities.

Detailed technological and cost roadmaps have yet to be published and it’s still not
obvious whether the technology will have a major impact on emissions reduction in
Japan. Even more, it’s also far from clear if it’ll allow Japan to continue burning coal
and gas in the coming decades. Something that the country certainly would like to do,
given the challenges it’s facing in expanding its renewable energy sector.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ Energy financing
In a first, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China didn’t
make a single overseas energy finance deal in 2021. In the past 20 years, these two
main trade policy banks have loaned a total of $234 billion to foreign governments
and the global energy sector.

Europe/ Tidal energy
A total of €70 million was invested in 2021 to build 2.2 MW of tidal stream capacity,
compared to just 260 kW in 2020; also, 681 kW of wave energy was installed in 2021,
a 300% YoY increase. Europe now has 11.5 MW of tidal stream capacity, and 1.4 MW
of wave energy.

Finland/ Nuclear power
The 1.6 GW Olkiluoto nuclear reactor 3 came online, nearly 12 years behind schedule.
It is Finland’s first new nuclear plant in four decades and Europe's first in 15 years.
Costs ballooned from the originally estimated €3 billion ($3.27 billion) to around €11
billion.

France/ Nuclear power
EDF expects a €26 billion hit in 2022, in stark contrast to a 2021 profit of €18 billion.
EDF has been forced to sell its nuclear power to distributors at a capped price. Also,
the company faces outages at several reactors in France due to pipe issues. Energy
production decreases could lead to losses of €16 billion, while price regulatory
measures might lead to losses of €10 billion.
India/ Net-zero
Mumbai plans to reach net-zero by 2050, far ahead of India's national goal of 2070.
It’ll be South Asia’s first city with such a goal. Mumbai, which is India’s largest city and
home to 19 million residents, is the country’s financial centre and where many leading
national and international corporations have headquarters.

Portugal/ Wind power
In summer, the first auction for floating offshore farms will be held. Once completed,
they’re expected to produce as much as 4 GW starting in 2026. Last year, Portugal
closed both of its coal-fired power plants. The country currently has 7.3 GW of
hydropower and 5.6 GW of onshore wind, accounting for 83% of total power
generation capacity.

Russia/ Fossil fuels
The three biggest western oilfield service companies — Schlumberger, Baker Hughes
and Halliburton — will remain in Russia, where they conduct billions of dollars’ worth
of business. The three companies are partners of state-controlled Rosneft and
Gazprom.

new wind power capacity. Hydropower and nuclear energy remain the country’s two
largest sources of electricity generation.

U.S. / Coal financing
Goldman Sachs was criticized for a $150 million loan to Peabody Energy, the world’s
biggest private sector coal producer. In 2019, Goldman said it would curb fossil fuel
financing, then considered the strongest pledge adopted by any major U.S financial
institution.

U.S. / Coal power
The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled an air pollution law that could lead to
the closure of about 18 GW of coal-fired power plants by 2030. The proposed rule
would require upwind states to curb emissions of pollutants that inhibit downwind
states’ from complying with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

UK/ Nuclear power
The operation of the Sizewell B nuclear power plant might be extended from 2035 to
2055. French owner and operator, EDF, will make a final decision in 2024. But any
decision must be ratified by the government. In wake of the Ukraine crisis, the British
PM is drawing up a new “energy supply strategy” to be published next week.

| U.S. / Coal power |
| The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled an air pollution law that could lead to |
| the closure of about 18 GW of coal-fired power plants by 2030. The proposed rule |
| would require upwind states to curb emissions of pollutants that inhibit downwind |
| states’ from complying with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. |
|  |
| UK/ Nuclear power |
| The operation of the Sizewell B nuclear power plant might be extended from 2035 to |
| 2055. French owner and operator, EDF, will make a final decision in 2024. But any |
| decision must be ratified by the government. In wake of the Ukraine crisis, the British |
| PM is drawing up a new “energy supply strategy” to be published next week. |
