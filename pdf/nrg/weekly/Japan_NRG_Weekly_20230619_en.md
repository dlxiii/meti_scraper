NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY







Japan to kickstart GX strategy this month by making Sapporo a ¥40 bln environmental hub
(Nikkei, June 17)
•  The govt is ready to kick start its ¥150 trillion Green Transformation (GX) investment program.
Later this month, it will reveal a plan to position Sapporo, Hokkaido Pref, as an international
environmental financial city

•  Sapporo will seek to attract as much as ¥40 trillion for clean energy projects and develop them in
sync with national plans to make Hokkaido a hub for the semiconductor industry.
•  CONTEXT: Private firms together with the govt have created a new company, Rapidus, to lead
Japan’s charge in advanced semiconductors. Rapidus aims to build a large factory in Hokkaido.
•  The Sapporo initiative is the collaboration of work by the govt and the country’s three largest
banks (Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui, and Mizuho). They aim to help with GX fundraising.
•  From the govt side, there are plans to make Sapporo City a special zone to nurture advanced

environmental finance by 2024. The idea is that it would help attract ESG capital and blended
finance (public and private funds). A new organization, Team Sapporo-Hokkaido, will be set up to
drive the efforts.
• TAKEAWAY: It should be no surprise that the govt is seeking to pair its national industrial strategy, which is
heavily tilted to semiconductors, with its energy and climate ambitions. This should be positive. After all,
Hokkaido is known to have the biggest renewables potential of all Japanese regions, largely thanks to its

flatter land and offshore wind resources. However, Hokkaido’s industrial demand never required such large
additions in energy supply. Meanwhile, transporting power halfway across the country to the Tokyo area or
beyond is expensive and likely to result in significant energy losses. Thus, marrying energy-intensive industries
with locally produced renewables resources makes sense. The challenge will be in tailoring the variable output
of solar and wind generators with industrial demand. It’s likely that some form of baseload, such as through the
restart of the Tomari NPP in southern Hokkaido, will also be required.




Panasonic calls for creation of Scope 4 to represent ‘avoided emissions’
(Financial Times, June 15)
•  Panasonic CEO Kusumi Yuki says a new metric is needed to assess a company’s decarbonization

efforts. It could be labelled as Scope 4 and represent GHG emissions that were avoided because a
business created products that help to reduce the overall environmental impact of society.
•  Panasonic is a major battery manufacturer for clients such as Tesla. However, the process of
making batteries is energy intensive and can lead to high carbon emissions.
•  CONTEXT: As per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, emissions fall into three categories: Scope 1 are
GHGs emitted by the company’s facilities; Scope 2 are GHGs emitted in making the electricity and

fuels that a business needs for operations; and Scope 3 are emissions from a company’s value
chain.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Panasonic targets reducing Scope 1 emissions to net zero by 2030. Panasonic’s products (batteries,
heat pumps, and fuel cells) will also help the world to avoid 300 million tons of CO2 equivalent by
2050, or about 1% of the world’s total emissions.
•  The company wants these ‘avoided emissions’ to be counted. Some other Japanese firms and
overseas asset managers are starting to support the idea of a new ‘avoided emissions’ metric, in

order to expand climate finance.


Tokyo Stock Exchange publishes changes for its Carbon Credit Market
(Company statement, June 9)
•  The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced a list of changes to its carbon trading platform, which is
currently in trial mode.

•  Changes include: Clarification that participants are prohibited to act as agents for orders from
other customers unless they already trade with the customer outside of the market.
•  Participants must adhere to the new invoice system starting October, which means they can only
engage in transactions with qualified invoice issuers when claiming input tax credits.
•  The names of participants will be listed on the JPX website.
•  The price limits on bids and offers will be lowered from 100% (as observed at the end of the demo

project) to 90%.
•  CONTEXT: For J-Credits, the price limits will be 90% above or below the base price, with any
fraction less than ¥1 being rounded down. The goal is to prevent incorrect order placement while
still allowing fair price formation.
• TAKEAWAY: After a five-month demonstration project stage last fiscal year, carbon trading was due to start in
the slightly upgraded “trial” mode. It seems that the stock exchange wants to iron out the rules before
restarting trading this fiscal year. The current plan is for trades to resume before the end of this fiscal year,

while still aiming for full operation in FY2026. TSE believes that transparency and clear rules are needed in
order to enroll participants and grow the market’s scale.



Govt clarifies structure of impact assessment of wind power station on fisheries
(Japan NRG, June 16)
•  METI and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism clarified the basic structure
for the plans to evaluate the impact of offshore wind stations on fisheries. Project operators are
expected to make detailed plans based on the suggested structure.
•  The structure follows the Murakami-Tainai wind assessment plan which studies the volume of fish
caught and delivered to ports, operating days, hours and distance traveled by fishing boats and

average catch.
•  Data will be taken a year before plant construction, during the construction period and for three
years after operations begin.
•  CONTEXT: Commercial fishermen are required to obtain fishing licenses from prefectural
authorities. The areas covered by the licenses cover all coastal areas around Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: Japanese Act on the Use of the Sea for Renewables defines the processes for launching offshore

wind projects but not “the rights to occupy sea areas,” which some say could complicate negotiations with
stakeholders such as the fishermen.

Fish catch volumes comprise a key metric in negotiations as fishermen are able to file compensation suits to
project developers on the basis of these numbers and other project operational data. The validity of damage
claims also depend on the type of fishing license. For example, the Yamaguchi District Court in 2016 dismissed
damage claims by local fishermen against wind projects saying the plaintiffs were not direct license holders but
members of a cooperative which holds such a license.



Mitsui O.S.K. Lines joins blue ammonia production project in U.S.

(Denki Shimbun, June 16)
•  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) joined the clean ammonia production and transportation project led by
Clean Hydrogen Works in Louisiana, U.S. MOL has investments in the operating company, which
will produce "blue ammonia" that involves capturing CO2 during manufacturing, and export it on
MOL ammonia transportation vessels.
•  The project aims to produce 7.2 million tons of blue ammonia annually using natural gas. The
target CO2 recovery rate is 98%. The cost for plant construction and port facilities is $7.5 billion.



JERA to collaborate with EnBW and VNG on ammonia supply chain in Germany
(Company statement, June 12)
•  JERA and German companies EnBW and VNG will conduct a study for an ammonia cracker demo
plant in Rostock, northeastern Germany. The goal is to assess the viability of building a plant that
produces hydrogen from ammonia.
•  The demo plant would facilitate importation of large amounts of hydrogen in the form of ammonia

from overseas. It would then be converted back into hydrogen and supplied to German
customers.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT
JERA, NS and Chiyoda to study how best to extract hydrogen from ammonia
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, June 13)
o  JERA, Nippon Shokubai, and Chiyoda joined forces to develop catalyst technology that
can efficiently extract hydrogen from ammonia. The main goal is to explore effective

strategies for utilizing ammonia as a carrier for hydrogen energy.
o  The project is part of a NEDO initiative that runs until FY2025. JERA will evaluate the
catalyst's performance.
o  Chiyoda will expand equipment size to facilitate larger-scale ammonia decomposition
and hydrogen production.
o  CONTEXT: Efficiently transporting hydrogen requires ultra-low temperatures, and

utilizing ammonia as an intermediate carrier offers advantages in long-distance
transportation due to its easier handling. Thus, it’s crucial to develop technology capable
of extracting hydrogen from ammonia.


INPEX to build world’s largest synthetic methane plant; test run expected in mid 2025

(Company statement, June 16)
•  INPEX began building the world's largest 400 NM3/ hour synthetic methane (e-methane) plant at
its Nagaoka City site in Niigata Pref.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The plant consists of methanation, gas supply and utility units. It will run on a trial basis in April
2025-March 2026. INPEX will supply the e-methane production to consumers via its city gas
pipeline.
•  Osaka Gas provided to INPEX technical advice on the methanation catalyst to speed up the
chemical process, and enlarge the plant size.
•  CONTEXT: E-methane is produced by reacting CO2 with hydrogen. INPEX and Osaka Gas

experimented with a 8 NM3/ h plant also built at the Nagaoka site.
• TAKEAWAY: The new plant will apply the traditional Sabatier methanation process. Osaka Gas is developing a
new process – SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell) methanation and an upgrade is possible if SOEC costs are
reduced and can be applied to big plants.



Osaka Gas urges METI to launch talks on e-methane carbon counting
(Japan NRG, June 14)
•  Osaka Gas urged METI to enhance bilateral policy discussions with potential synthetic methane (e-

methane) producing countries. A company official made the request during the Public Private
Council to Promote Methanation meeting.
•  The company proposes a system that sets carbon release of final e-methane consumers at zero, to
incentivize synthetic gas use.
•  It also proposed issuing e-methane certificates and allowing the certificates to trade.
•  Osaka Gas, along with other gas utilities and trading houses, is conducting e-methane production
feasibility studies in the U.S., Australia, Peru, and Malaysia.



JOGMEC  selects seven sites to store 13 million tons of CO2
(Official statement, June 13)
•  JOGMEC will provide financial assistance and technical support to accelerate the deployment of
CCS technology. It chose seven sites in Japan for CCS projects with a total storage capacity of 13
million tons by 2030.
•  In FY2023, the govt allocated ¥3.5 billion for advanced CCS projects. The five cases of domestic

storage will be hubs for CCS, with potential for future expansion.
•  The agency aims to develop 20 to 25 sites by 2050 and achieve annual CO2 storage of 120 million

Toyota to “challenge” lithium solid battery roll out in 2027-2028
(Company statements, June 13)
•  Toyota Motor said it developed a solution to improve durability of all solid-state lithium batteries,
which will speed up replacement of present lithium ion batteries.

•  The company will “challenge” the goal to offer the battery product in 2027-2028. Its research team
is working on mass production.
•  In 2018, the company said taxis mounted with the prototype solid batteries would run during the
2020 Tokyo Olympics, but then scrapped the plan. Instead, it conducted test drives of a battery-
mounted passenger car.
•  CONTEXT: Toyota Motor ranks top in the number of solid battery related patents in the world.

There are two mainstream technologies: sulfur-based and oxide-based batteries. Toyota is focused
on sulfur-based solid cells.
• TAKEAWAY: Automakers are competing to be the first to commercialize solid batteries. Nissan Motor also
plans to offer solid-state batteries by 2028.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT

TEPCO to invest $7 bln into renewables by FY2030

(Nikkei Asia, June 17)
•  TEPCO Holdings seeks to invest ¥1 trillion ($7 billion) on renewable energy projects by FY2030,
which should allow the company to add 6 GW to 7 GW of new capacity.
•  This will include about 2-3 GW of offshore wind both in Japan and overseas, including in the UK
and Australia, and will likely be done with partners, according to TEPCO Renewable Power
President Nagasawa. The company will bid in Japan’s second round of offshore wind auctions; the
deadline is this month.
•  TEPCO also plans to add more hydropower overseas. It already has 10 GW of hydropower in its

portfolio in Japan.
•  CONTEXT: TEPCO also plans to spend about ¥9 trillion by FY2030 on decarbonization. Most of

Sojitz cancels plans to build wind power plant in Hokkaido on rising costs, local opposition
(Hokkaido Shimbun, Bloomberg, June 13-17)
•  Sojitz has canceled plans to build a 109 MW wind power plant with 26 turbines in the state-owned
forest in Hokkaido. It cited rising materials costs and local opposition due to environmental

concerns.
•  The Otaru city mayor said that preventing environmental damage is more important than
economic benefits from tax revenue of about ¥2 billion over 20 years. The mayor said he
welcomed offshore wind plans but would not approve Sojitz’s project until all concerns were
resolved.
•  Sojitz intended to install large wind turbines in forests located in the city of Otaru and the town of

Yoichi in Hokkaido. Local opposition even pushed the Hokkaido governor to say that the local

10


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

community lacked a clear understanding of the project. Sojitz said that it had tried to change the
project layout to mitigate impact on the landscape.
•  CONTEXT: Several wind farm projects in Hokkaido were recently canceled due to local opposition.
Kansai Electric and Hitachi Zosen were among the firms affected.
• TAKEAWAY: Setting global and national targets is not the same as implementing them on a local level. It’s

well known that Hokkaido holds great potential for wind power, both onshore and offshore. The region’s goal
is to be a “Zero Carbon City” by 2050, and companies have interest in building over 50 wind power stations
locally. There are also plans for more than 1 GW in offshore wind projects, but just as residents have a say over
land-based developments so local fishermen can block the construction of turbines close to the coast.



Toyota Tsusho completes storage battery system and wind power plant in Hokkaido

Toshiba developing new floating offshore wind turbine technology
(Company statement, June 9)
•  Toshiba Energy Systems, University of Kyushu, Hitachi Zosen, and NSK will use a large-scale wind

tunnel to research evaluation methods of wake effects for floating offshore wind turbines. Their
project was accepted by NEDO as a part of its new technology/energy and environmental R&D
program.
•  The wake effect is the trail left by each turbine whereby wind speeds are reduced. The wind

Japanese Perovskite Solar Startups: Lucrative Investment
Opportunities?


There’s a very good chance that Japan can take the lead in the next stage of solar
tech development. But there’s a snag. While the research side requires vast
resources, Japan has closed ranks around its main players in the space to prevent
precious knowhow from leaking.

Two of Japan’s leading actors in the next-generation of solar tech, known as
perovskite solar cell (PSC), are actually startups. Some of Japan’s PSC pioneers may
seek funding to evolve their R&D into commercial products. Whether investors will be
able to step in, however, remains moot. According to NEDO, the state research hub
that’s provided funding for almost all Japanese PSC research, there is no ban on
foreign investment into domestic PSC players, but those that received grants should
be “mindful of national interests”, an official told Japan NRG.

The situation shows the difficulty of pushing through innovation along the lines of the
Silicon Valley style, venture capital model. At the same time, Prime Minister Kishida’s
Green Transformation (GX) strategy insists that it is private capital that will act as the
catalyst for decarbonization in Japan.

Still wary after seeing its global dominance in the prior iteration of solar tech usurped
by China, Japan’s caution around PSC is understandable. The tiny market share that
Japan retains in world PV sales contrasts with China’s utter dominance of the
industry. And yet, working in isolation as a quasi national project does not seem to be
a viable option either. It certainly didn’t help the country build its own regional jet or
revive the LCD industry.

Recently, PM Kishida courted international collaboration as a way to rebuild Japan’s
semiconductor chips sector and there were reports of him touting such an approach
at the recent G7 Summit. That suggests that the current mystique around the next-
gen solar sector could recede in time, allowing private international capital to come
in. For investors, what opportunities would this bring?


Background
In the first decade of the 2000s, Japan was the global leader in solar technology as
Sharp, Kyocera, Sanyo (now Panasonic) and Mitsubishi Electric supplied half of the
global market. Today, however, Chinese competitors dominate every step of the
supply chain. China holds over over 90% of global polysilicon, wafer, solar cell, and
module manufacturing capacity.
To challenge China’s position, one needs to develop a new industrial ecosystem for
solar technology that doesn’t rely on polysilicon. That’s the genesis of Japan’s PSC
idea.

PSC makes use of perovskite-structured crystal compounds instead of silicon as the
light-absorbing layer for generating electricity. The perovskite layer is thin and light

as a film, allowing panels to be manufactured in flexible shapes and sizes. Processed
at normal temperatures – as opposed to silicon that’s manufactured at 1,400° C – the
technology uses less power and thus has a low-carbon footprint.

PSC, however, has a number of stumbling blocks on the road to commercialization. It
still lacks chemical stability and durability. The bigger PSC modules tend to have
lower efficiency. This makes it tricky to scale up to mass manufacturing. In addition,
the current energy efficiency of PSC halves after 1,000 hours of continuous charging /
discharging, which is too fast for commercial applications.

To overcome such issues, developers need to find new raw materials, explore
printing, rolling and other innovations to process cell layers, or stack PSC on top of
silicon layers to form a tandem cell.

The main sector goals are to:
•  Raise power efficiency from 10-20% to 20-30%
•  Expand module size to one-meter square from one-centimeter square, and
•  Develop stronger resistance against moisture and other environmental
conditions.

All this is seen as possible, but it requires hefty sums of investment.

Globally, PSC startups are starting to attract bigger ticket investments. In 2019, UK-
based startup Oxford PV raised $80 million from investors including China’s Gold
Wind and the German government. Last year, U.S.-based CubicPV took in $26
million from Thailand’s SCG Cleanergy and UK’s Synergy Capital, among others.

Poland’s Saule Technologies, which is seen by some as the current global leader in
PSC applications, even attracted Japanese private capital. Travel firm entrepreneur
Sawada Hideo backed Saule Technologies with over $5 million. Sawada seems to
believe he can help Saule establish its first Asian hub in Japan.

In comparison, Japan’s startups have had a tougher time attracting resources.
Japan’s venture capitalism ecosystem is 34 times smaller than the one in the U.S.


Japan’s PSC scene
Most of the funding for Japan’s PSC research to date has come from NEDO (New
Energy and Industry Development Organization), which has handed out ¥49.8 billion
($355 million) in state grants. This has gone to both mature market players and
startups.

There are two main PSC startups in Japan:
•  EneCoat Technologies, founded by Kyoto University researchers
•  Peccell Technologies, established by Dr. Miyasaka Tsutomu, a former Toin
University of Yokohama professor and the person who invented the world’s first
perovskite solar cell in 2009

In the last two years, Kyoto-based EneCoat Technologies raised ¥2.1 billion ($15
million) from over 20 Japanese companies and funds including KDDI, NGK Insulators
and Toyoda Gosei. Set up in 2018, EneCoat is capitalized at ¥90 million. After raising
¥2.1 billion, its goal is to become an integrated PSC manufacturer, covering raw

19

material production, and mass module manufacturing, which it hopes to start in
2024.

Yokohama-based Peccell Technologies has a lower public profile, even though it
launched the country’s first mass production of PSC modules in 2021. Former
Yokohama University Professor Miyasaka founded the company in 2004. Capitalized
at ¥20 million, Peccell develops PSC mass production by applying print technologies.

The Peccell module had 60 x 100 cm dimensions and a power efficiency of around
15%. The company also researches dye sensitized solar cells commissioned by the
government. Unlike EneCoat, it has not raised funds, nor has plans to do so.

EneCoat

Peccell
2004        Yokohama University researcher ¥20 million NA
Technologies
While both startups seem to enjoy a positive market reputation, development of PSC
is highly risky. R&D takes a long time and is capital intensive. Most startups run out of
funds before making significant breakthroughs and seeing their product reach
commercialization.
The high-risk nature of the field makes securing more private capital difficult, while
the pool of domestic venture capitalist funding is small on an international scale.

So, it may be no surprise that a lot of the big PSC players in Japan today are actually
established conglomerates such as Sekisui Chemicals, Toshiba, Panasonic and Aisin.
Blue chips have resources and manufacturing capabilities, but on a global basis it is
the smaller, university-affiliated enterprises that are making the biggest strides in PSC
innovation at the moment.


Perovskite network expands
Japan’s startup funding model tends to focus on big companies partnering with
startups to carry the development. In the PSC space, automotive component
manufacturer Toyoda Gosei has joined with EneCoat to co-develop PSC mass
manufacturing processes. This doesn’t mean that the partner will limit their PSC
application to autos, a spokesman for Toyoda Gosei told Japan NRG.

NGK Insulators, a storage battery manufacturer, plans to combine EneCoat’s PSC
with its sodium sulfide storage battery systems, and sees potential for PSC-powered
IoT devices, and PSC-embedded zero emission buildings.

Since their days at Kyoto University, EneCoat’s researchers have worked with
chemical companies to develop raw materials. The Tokyo Chemical Industry has
commercialized some of these products. Osaka-based Mitsuboshi Diamond Industrial
began manufacturing laser processing machines on request from Kyoto University.

“We had a strong track record in cutting instruments for glass panels and copper-
indium-selenide solar panels and this was relevant to the university’s requirement,”
said a company official. The machinery was commercialized in 2020.

Meanwhile, Peccell Tech has brought Wakayama-based Kishu Giken Kogyo into the
PSC space, seeing a potential to apply the latter’s inkjet printing technology in PSC
manufacturing.

In a rare case of international collaboration, Kishu Giken Kogyo has reached out to
Swiss Solaronix and German research institute FraunhofaISE to work jointly on
improving PSC durabilities. This collaboration became possible because the project
was an international research program of several govts.

With demand for PSC prototype manufacturing machines on the rise, there are more
market entrants. “We have up to 10 orders for PSC prototype production machines.
Over half are from academia and some are from companies planning to launch new
R&D programs,” said one manufacturer.

Universities with semiconductor device and electronics engineering departments are
keen to diversify into PSC research. There is a clear goal to create higher power
efficiency and that’s fueling competition and motivation. At the same time, the
government is encouraging universities to monetize their patents and promising
startup support plans.

Material science research is also shifting to PSC. In 2018, Chiba University established
Chiba Iodine Resource Innovation Center (CIRIC), a research facility allowing
university and company-hired researchers to work on iodine application development
including perovskite materials.

Business sector participants include Ise Chemicals Industry, which is developing
perovskite ink, and Godo Shigen, a manufacturer of iodine chemicals. Godo is
presently developing high purity iodine lead as a possible PSC raw material.


Isolation risks mis-direction
Such a concerted domestic effort has created a vibrant but inward-looking PSC sector
in Japan. Unlike developers abroad, which are working in collaboration and with an
eye on global markets, Japan’s PSC startups say they are constricted.

Both EneCoat and Peccell tell Japan NRG that they aren’t actively seeking foreign
investments or ties with foreign companies. “Licensing to overseas companies and
receiving foreign funds are very sensitive issues. We cannot comment, even say as
much as yes or no. This would lead to repercussions,” one official said.

Identifying other good prospects in the sector is tricky. Universities no longer disclose
their R&D collaboration with the private sector, citing data security.

Even companies involved in the PSC supply chain say they are at present cautious
about approaching overseas partners or capital.

The problem with such isolation is that domestic development could veer away from
the needs of the global market. That’s already evident in the approach to PSC
module composition. In Japan, developers are focused on avoiding silicon at all costs
since that is seen as key to breaking free from a China-dominant solar supply chain.

But in Europe and the U.S. industry players see the tandem cells which combine PSC
and silicon cells as a way to boost energy efficiency and entice buyers.

In Japan, there is only one global tandem cell player: Kaneka.

From the point of energy security, Japan’s approach may well make sense. But any
product is nothing without demand. International investors would help Japanese R&D
develop with an eye on the global consumer. This is a realization that may be finally
dawning on the sector.

What’s Changed in Three Years?
A Review of the Energy Sector Since Japan NRG Launched

Japan NRG published the first weekly report exactly three years ago. In this time, a
lot has changed in terms of policies and corporate actions, but also in the report’s
style and content. We hope the changes are for the better.

In June 2020, Japan was several months into dealing with a new pandemic and
uncertainty swirled around energy supply and demand. The country had yet to
embrace the language and spirit of “net zero” or “carbon neutrality”. However, many
of the directions that Japan’s energy sphere has taken since then were already
emerging.

Looking back at the first issues of Japan NRG Weekly, what’s surprising is how many
of the stories and narratives seem familiar even today. A number of traditional energy
firms were taking early steps into renewables. The major power utilities were
engulfed in multiple scandals. Climate action groups were pressuring companies to
exit coal. And new technologies were threatening to disrupt established incumbents.

Such story echoes might feed into the idea that in Japan nothing ever changes. Yet,
clearly the energy landscape is markedly different from where it was in June 2022.
Today, Japan has a law that mandates net-zero emissions nationwide by 2050. The
level of investment primed for clean energy projects is several times bigger; the
scope of innovation is broader; the attention and sense of urgency is that much
greater and widespread. Also, Japan’s actions are much more in tune with those in
other parts of the world.

In this piece, we’re taking a trip down memory lane to review what were the big
issues and stories when Japan NRG first launched, and give an update on those
developments.

Market for crude oil and oil products is shrinking
















A string of mergers in the oil refining sector left three brands (ENEOS, Idemitsu and
Cosmo) in control of around 95% of the market. The Covid-19 pandemic further
damaged the industry as transport and transit activity considerably slowed. At the
time, JXTG Holdings (now ENEOS) chairman Sugimori Tsutomu correctly predicted
that it would take until 2022/2023 for domestic oil demand to recover.

TODAY: Activist investors associated with Murakami Yoshiaki have taken a stake in
Cosmo and are pushing the smallest of the domestic majors to consider further
industry consolidation. Murakami helped Idemitsu complete its merger with Showa
Shell Sekiyu in 2019 and has strong industry connections. Cosmo, however, is
resisting Murakami’s advice and has gone on the defensive.


Traditional energy firms moving into greener options








One reason Cosmo isn’t playing ball in seeking mergers with rival oil firms is because
the company has spent a number of years expanding into renewables and electric
vehicles (EVs).

TODAY: The energy group operates at least 300 MW of renewable energy projects
already and aims to grow its wind power generation capacity to 1.5 GW by 2030
through onshore and offshore operations. The group is also now pursuing new
business directions in biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Of course, Cosmo isn’t the only traditional energy firm to branch out. In our first
edition, Sapporo-based gasoline station chain, Hokkaido Energy, appointed a new
president to explore ways to enter the renewables field. TEPCO Holdings chair

Kobayakawa Tomoaki promised to make stronger investments into renewable energy
sources as well as nuclear energy.


Major power utilities (EPCOs) are in trouble?
In the summer of 2020, the former regional power monopolies were facing a number
of scandals. TEPCO’s Kobayakawa may have talked about the need to go green, but
the company was in the public light for allegedly allowing contractors to cold-call the
elderly and manipulate them into switching electricity providers. When the practice
was discovered, TEPCO was reported as ordering contractors to falsify recordings of
customer conversations.















Meanwhile, directors of Kansai Electric were revealed as bribing at least 75 people in
the locality around the utility’s Takahama nuclear station to be favorably disposed to
the plant’s restart. In a highly unusual move, Japan’s top newspaper by circulation,
the Yomiuri Shimbun, lambasted Kansai Electric in particular for its actions and called
for a drastic overhaul of corporate culture.

The scandals helped push more households and business subscribers to switch
suppliers to new market entrants. Japan NRG Weekly’s first-ever analysis text,
published June 19, 2020, noted none of the EPCOs featured in the Top 10 best
electricity retailers in a ranking compiled by aggregator site Denryko Kaisha Hack.
Consumers turned from EPCOs to companies like Tokyo Gas, ENEOS, Rakuten and
SoftBank, according to the ranking.

TODAY: Earlier this year, Kansai Electric was one of several major utilities accused by
officials of anti-competitive behavior and cartel-like activities. TEPCO continues to be
beset by governance issues, especially around its nuclear station in Kashiwazaki
Kariwa. And the utilities are hurting from high fuel prices and constraints over how
much they are allowed to raise tariffs.

Despite all this, the EPCOs are actually in a stronger position than three years earlier.
The energy crisis over the last 18 months has led to more than a quarter of new
entrants in the power retail sector suspending operations or going bankrupt. Many
customers have flocked back to EPCOs for stability. However, recent price increases
by new players like SoftBank mean that they are now more expensive than major
utilities.

Climate action on the rise
Environmental action groups have been pushing corporate Japan to walk away from
coal for many years with mixed success.



















TODAY: Japanese firms are facing a record number of proposals from shareholders
this year, with quite a few related to climate action. Not only non-profit organizations,
but investment funds are now asking firms to expand climate change-related
disclosures and firm up plans to hit net zero emissions. Among the firms under the
spotlight in 2023 are TEPCO, trading house Mitsubishi Corp, and Toyota Motor. The
big banks, including Mizuho, are again targeted by environmental groups both inside
and outside the country to get tough on loans to fossil fuel projects.


Geopolitical tensions
Russia-Japan relations plummeted last year after Moscow’s incursion into Ukraine,
but friction between the two in the energy field was evident even in June 2020.












TODAY: In line with G7 allies, Japan has introduced a series of sanctions against
Russia and vowed to phase out imports of its crude oil and coal. That promise never
carried a definitive timeline and continues to be problematic to complete. Oil and
coal imports are down, but energy security concerns show that they are unlikely to
dwindle to zero anytime soon. The same and more can be said about Japan’s imports

of Russian LNG, which actually look set to increase with the start of the Arctic 2 LNG
project at the end of 2023 / early 2024.


Pursuit of offshore wind potential
Former Prime Minister Suga’s October 2020 declaration that Japan will be net-zero
2050 led to the creation of a national Green Growth Strategy, which for the first time
put offshore wind as one of the top vectors for clean energy development in the
country. But this change did not come entirely out of the blue.



















TODAY: Interest in developing offshore wind power in Japan continues to grow with
many international as well as domestic companies bidding in government auctions for
new projects. But the transition from fixing wind turbines to the ocean floor to
creating floating turbine technology continues to be a work in process. Recently,
groups led by J-Power and Japan Marine United (JMU) announced either mock-up
tests or demonstration projects of new floating turbines as part of national
development projects. Still, a homegrown floating turbine is not expected to enter
commercial operations until the end of this decade.


Out of the blue (hydrogen)
One narrative that has undergone drastic change in the last three years, however, is
the future of hydrogen development. Initially pitched by Japan as a fuel for transport,
the country has revised its primary application of hydrogen and now considers it
initially as a fuel for power generation. Later, it’s seen as expanding to Industrial
applications / mobility. What’s more, hydrogen itself has changed “form” in the
government's strategy over these years. Today, ammonia, which is a compound of
one nitrogen and three hydrogen atoms, is seen as a more practical version of a gas
from the “hydrogen family”. Meanwhile, the debate over the colors of hydrogen
seems to be waning and moving in the direction of calculating associated CO2
content rather than categorization by power source.

Prices
One aspect that has changed considerably from three years ago was the price of
energy. Soon after the outbreak of Covid-19 global prices for many energy
commodities plummeted and demand was uncertain. The year 2020 saw electricity
and gas bills drop precipitously, before the volatility of 2021 and 2022 unleashed wild
swings in pricing amid numerous energy crises.

Today, many energy conversations remain focused on the cost of deploying one or
another technology. Most of these discussions are still based on the idea that
generation and demand are constant, and that theoretical pricing models such as the
LCOE are applicable in real life. The last three years show that volatility in markets,
societies, weather, supply chains and cost will surely only increase. Hoping that a
cheap and plentiful solution will emerge is fanciful. If there is one thing that the last
three years of Japan NRG Weekly reporting conclusively shows, it's that our energy
systems need to be resilient, flexible, and multifaceted. They will need to deal not
only with what we already know or suspect, but also what we have yet to anticipate.

GLOBAL      VIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Germany/ Natural gas
Industrial capacity might be curtailed if Ukraine’s gas transit agreement with Russia
isn’t renewed after its expiration. The country’s energy minister said that
policymakers should avoid “making the same mistake” by assuming that the
economy will be unaffected without precautions to secure energy supplies.

Mexico/ Thermal power plants
Spanish utility Iberdrola will sell to the state 13 gas-fired thermal power plants for $6
billion, which is 55% of its Mexican business. The company is now focused on wind
and solar power generation in Europe and the Americas.

Netherlands/ Natural gas
The Groningen gas field will likely shut on October 1. The cabinet will make an official
decision later this month. The Netherlands previously aimed to close the field by
October 2024, but officials face pressure over the earthquakes it causes.

Nigeria/ Oil
Crude oil production fell to slightly more than 1 million b/d in April, dropping below
Angola’s production that was estimated at 1.1 million b/d. Oil theft and sabotage of
export infrastructure are major issues in Nigeria, which was once Africa’s leading
crude oil producer.

Renewable diesel
Labor costs and commodity prices are hurting the renewable diesel sector. Cargill
suspended plans to build a giant soybean-processing plant to make feedstock for
renewable diesel. Exxon Mobil canceled a deal to buy the green fuel from Global
Clean Energy Holdings, which faces project delays in part from a lack of skilled
workers.

Russia/ Oil
President Putin spoke on the price ceiling for Russian oil: “with our OPEC+ partners
we make joint decisions that minimize negative consequences for global energy
markets when politically motivated economic decisions are made. We are gradually
replacing one market with another. Our companies act more energetically, looking
for new partners and they find them.”

Slovakia/ Nuclear power
The Economy Ministry and Slovenské elektrárne agreed to support development of
small modular reactors (SMRs), including applying for funding from Project Phoenix
(U.S.). Other partners include U.S. Steel Košice and the Slovak Electricity Transmission
System.

Solar energy
Solar energy parts maker CubicPV raised $103 million to build a U.S. factory to make
silicon wafers, the key components for solar panels. The investment was led by the
Thai conglomerate SCG, with additional funding from Bill Gates' Breakthrough
Energy. China produces about 98% of the world's wafers.

UK/ Natural gas storage
A partial reopening in October of the largest gas storage, Rough, boosted the UK’s
stockpiles, but that’s not enough. The UK now has nine days of peak winter demand
in storage, by far Europe’s lowest. Compare that to Germany’s 89 day’s worth of
peak demand storage.

U.S./ UK/ Nuclear power
Both countries announced the Atlantic Declaration, which is a framework for
economic cooperation. Nuclear power cooperation is one main area. The goal is to
develop end-to-end fuel cycles to challenge Russian uranium fuel dominance.
