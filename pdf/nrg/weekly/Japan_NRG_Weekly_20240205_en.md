METI finalizes criteria for hydrogen / ammonia hubs, plans to choose eight sites

(Government statement, Jan 29)
•  METI published the interim report on the hydrogen / ammonia policies, including the criteria for
hydrogen / ammonia hubs. Municipalities selected as the hub receive state funding to build
infrastructure.
•  METI plans to choose eight sites – three big and five mid-sized hubs – and will start the selection
process this summer.
•  The criteria include:
o  Demand for over 10,000 metric tons / year of low-carbon hydrogen

o  Resourceful, efficient infrastructure and utilization of net zero assets
o  Carbon intensity of hydrogen at the site will be below the threshold
o  Mid- and long-term plans for building infrastructure that can integrate new carbon
recycling and CCUS technologies
o  At least a 10-year commitment to supply hydrogen / ammonia as required.
•  CONTEXT: Asia Nikkei reported the govt plans to spend ¥3 trillion ($20.3 billion) over the next 15

years to subsidize clean hydrogen.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Six companies study possibility of ammonia supply hub in Fukushima
(Company statement, Jan 30)
o  Japan Petroleum Exploration (JAPEX), Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, Mitsui OSK Lines, IHI,
and Mitsui & Co launched a study to explore the potential to create an ammonia supply

hub in the Soma area of Fukushima Pref.
o  It will assess Soma as a base to import, store and reload ammonia for delivery to the final
destinations, as well as demand of hydrogen and ammonia in the wider Soma area.
They’ll also survey users in the hard-to-abate sectors on their net zero plans.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kagawa Pref establishes hydrogen business collaboration council

(Government statement, Feb 1)
o  Kagawa Pref set up a council composed of businesses and municipalities to promote net
zero initiatives such as transition to hydrogen energy in the Bannosu Coastal Industrial
Park.
o  CONTEXT: Kawasaki City (Kanagawa Pref), Yamaguchi Pref, Tomakomai City (Hokkaido),
etc are expected to raise hands as the hubs.

METI outlines first CCS project bill for Diet approval - operations to begin by 2030
(METI statement, Jan 29)
•  METI will submit a CCS project proposal to the Diet outlining a permit system for drilling and
storage, with operators responsible for compensation in case of accidents.
•  The bill has two main components. One is a licensing system for drilling and storage. The other is

regulations for storage operators. It aims to establish CCS projects by 2030 and has provisions for
monitoring and management tasks.
•  CONTEXT: The govt estimates that burying 120-240 mln tons of CO2 annually is necessary for the
2050 decarbonization goal.
• TAKEAWAY: A key issue of the proposal is related to operator liability. According to the bill outline, operators
will be held liable for any damage of the carbon storage operation. This applies both in case operators cause

damage with malice or without malice. Project operators will likely need to find someone willing to insure the
projects, and enter in an insurance plan, which will add to the already high expenses of CCS projects. State
support, especially through JOGMEC’s funds, seems essential to launch the CCS economy.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Toshiba ESS delivers compact CO2 capture system to Tokyo Gas
(Company statement, Jan 30)
o  Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions (ESS) installed a compact CO2 capture system (3.1
by 2 by 2.8 meters) at Tokyo Gas Senju Techno Station. Operations begin in March and it
will capture around 5% concentration CO2 emissions from a gas cogeneration system.
o  Toshiba's CC technology employs post-combustion capture methods, and features an

amine-based solvent for CO2 capture. The compact system is part of Toshiba's efforts to
meet increasing demand for small-scale CC systems.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
NYK, Chiyoda Corp, KNCC conduct CCUS viability study
(Company statement, Jan 31)
o  Chiyoda Corp, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK), and Knutsen NYK Carbon Carriers

(KNCC) completed a CCUS study that focuses on liquefaction, temporary storage, and
marine transportation of CO2. Three methods were examined: elevated pressure (EP),
medium pressure (MP), and low pressure (LP).
o  The study concluded that cylinder tanks for onshore storage reduces construction time,
and also optimizes land use, lowers investment and operating costs, and enhances
energy efficiency.




Prof Miyasaka developing tech to control Perovskite solar cell performance

(Japan NRG, Feb 1)
•  Prof Miyasaka Tsutomu of Toin University of Yokohama, also known as the father of perovskite
solar cells (PSC), is developing technologies to improve control over grains comprising the
perovskite crystals. PSC power conversion efficiency remains lower than that of silicon-based PV.
•  Boundaries between grains allow moisture and other substances to penetrate into the perovskite
layer, causing performance and quality issues. Miyasaka is exploring ways to enlarge the grain size
and to make the surface more uniform using a technique called “passivation”.

•  Passivation is minimizing the impact from the barrier between the grains. Miyasaka is testing
caffeine, glycine, and hydrazine as possible solutions.
•  Electrical performance may be improved by doping the indium tin oxide layer, which lies below the
perovskite layer, with potassium.
•  Prof Miyasaka is also exploring lead-free PSC, using tin.

ENEOS eyes producing Perovskite material at gas fields
(Japan NRG, Jan 29)
o  ENEOS group company JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration seeks to be a supplier of
Perovskite solar cell (PSC) raw materials using iodine found in gas fields.
o  Last month, the company donated ¥2 million to Niigata University to increase

engagement with researchers. In September last year, it inked a development agreement
with Godo Shigen, Japan’s largest iodine producer.
o  JX Nippon Exploration produces 220 metric tons / year of 99.7%-purity iodine at its
Nakajo oil / gas field (Niigata Pref); INPEX has a larger production of 600 tons / year at
Chiba and Niigata pref gas fields.
o  CONTEXT: Japan is the world’s second largest iodine producer with 10,000 tons of
annual output. Policymakers hope that the country’s energy self-sufficiency will rise with

the rollout of PSC technology. According to Prof Miyasaka’s calculations, if PSC raw
material costs are reduced to ¥200 / m2, power could be generated at ¥6-7 / kWh, below
the current levels of about ¥10 / kWh for solar PV. For PSC production, iodine needs to
be refined into 99.999% purity and all possible moisture must be removed. Currently,
99.7% iodine powder costs around ¥40-50 per gram, while perovskite-grade lead iodide
costs ¥3,000-4000 per gram.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Ricoh to conduct Perovskite outdoor night lighting study
(Company statement, Feb 1)
o  Ricoh will conduct a year-long field study of perovskite solar cell-powered outdoor
lighting in Ota City (Tokyo) and Atsugi City (Kanagawa Pref) to measure impact of
temperature, humidity and illuminance on module performance at night.
• TAKEAWAY: The field study will use Ricoh PSC modules made to generate power for night lights. Perovskite

crystals also generate light and could be used as light emitting diodes (LED), but this study will focus on their
performance as a power source.




Honda and GM launch production of FCEVs in U.S., seek to stimulate hydrogen demand
(Company statement, Jan 25)
•  Fuel Cell System Manufacturing, a JV between Honda and General Motors, began production of

the first hydrogen fuel cell system in Michigan, U.S.
•  The system is a third the cost of the system that Honda used in its 2019 FCEVs. It will be installed
in the new FCEVs that Honda plans to launch by late 2024.
•  The company plans to expand the use of the system, focusing on four application areas, including
commercial vehicles, stationary power sources, and construction machinery.

Asahi Kasei, Toray to invest in green hydrogen manufacturing equipment
(Nikkei, Feb 1)
•  Asahi Kasei plans to increase its manufacturing capacity of electrolyzers. It will bring onstream a
pilot manufacturing plant in Kawasaki City (Kanagawa Pref) in spring 2024, and will start taking

commercial orders in 2025.
•  Initially, it will have an annual capacity for 1GW of electrolyzers, which will be expanded to 2 GW
during the fiscal year ending in March 2026.
•  In Oct 2023, Toray Industries raised the output capacity of catalyst-coated membranes, a core
electrolyzer component, at its German plant by 3.5 times to 1.4 GW. The annual capacity will be
increased further to 3 GW in 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: Asahi Kasei uses alkaline water electrolysis tech while Toray focuses on proton-exchange

membrane (PEM) tech; they’re direct competitors. Apart from capital and operational costs, stability and ease
of maintenance, the consistent quality of hydrogen being produced is a key factor when it comes to choosing
electrolysis tech, one green hydrogen project stakeholder told Japan NRG. Buyers typically seek 99.99% purity
guarantees, rather than the vehicle-grade purity of 99.97%.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Hokkaido Electric, ENEOS to build 100 MW green hydrogen plant
(Japan NRG, Jan 30)
o  Hokkaido Electric and ENEOS plan a 100 MW green hydrogen plant in Tomakomai City
(Hokkaido), and will start offering its supply to factories in the local industrial complex by
2030, said an ENEOS official at a hydrogen event in Tokyo.

o  Preliminary studies were done in 2022-2023.
o  CONTEXT: If built, this will be Japan’s largest green hydrogen plant.




Kawasaki Heavy to conduct hydrogen trade management system study
(Company statement, Jan 30)
•  In April, Kawasaki Heavy Industries will start a review of a digital management system that can be
used for a hydrogen trading platform in domestic and international markets.
•  The platform will manage hydrogen qualities such as the gas origin, GHG data in the supply chain
stages, distribution routes, relevant certifications, etc.

•  The company plans to commercialize the system in about 2028.
• TAKEAWAY: Currently, hydrogen without any climate attributes sells at about the METI price benchmark of
¥100 / NM3. Green hydrogen’s pricing is far from transparent, and varies according to the delivery location,
volume, applications, solar power costs, etc. This platform, if successful, would contribute to market
transparency.

Tokyo Gas completes trial of low-cost floating foundation tech for offshore wind
(Company statement, Jan 26)
•  Tokyo Gas completed a trial of offshore wind floating foundations, seeking to develop a low-cost
construction tech suitable for larger wind turbines (15 MW scale), severe weather and sea

conditions, and suitable for mass production.
•  The project used a semi-submersible floating foundation and a hybrid mooring system that
combines steel mooring and synthetic fiber mooring ropes. The tech is expected to help expand
floating offshore wind power in Japan.
• TAKEAWAY: The project receives NEDO funding from FY2021 to 2024. NEDO is also funding TEPCO, which is
developing a similar tech called "large floating spar".



















Mitsui Mining to triple solid battery electrolyte production

(Japan NRG, Jan 31)
•  Mitsui Mining and Smelting plans to triple its output capacity of sulfide solid electrolytes for all-
solid-state batteries. The electrolyte, called A-SOLiD, is made of argyrodite which consists of
lithium, halogen element and phosphorus.
•  Mitsui began A-SOLiD production in 2021, for sample shipments. The product development is not
yet complete as improvements are needed to cut costs; but demand is strong, a company official

said.
•  In November last year, Maxell began commercial shipment of A-SOLiD containing solid batteries
to Nikon. It is sized 1 cubic centimeter and has a 8 mAh capacity.
• TAKEAWAY: Sulfide solid batteries operate under high temperatures of 125 C, which was not possible for
lithium-ion-batteries. Maxell plans to develop 5,000 mAh capacity solid batteries by 2030, and eyes storage
batteries for solar farms as its key market.

(Company statement, Jan 25)
•  Hitachi and Iwamizawa City, (Hokkaido Pref), began testing a system to circulate renewable energy
obtained from self-supporting nanogrids using a portable AC/DC combination battery developed

by Hitachi.
•  The firm began testing the new tech on Jan 25 in Iwamizawa City. The project is done jointly with
Iseki, one of Japan’s largest farm machinery producers. The system seeks to supply renewable
energy to dispersed farmlands.
•  Iwamizawa city also plans to use the batteries at EV charging stations.




JGA asks GHG Protocol Secretariat to revise its GHG Protocol
(JGA statement, Jan 31)
•  The Japan Gas Association (JGA) is committed to tackling climate change by seeking to replace

90% of natural gas with e-methane by 2050. JGA said this in an open letter to the GHG Protocol
Secretariat on Jan 25.
•  It suggests including a market-based approach for carbon recycled fuels in Scope 1 emissions
reporting. Examples are e-methane, e-fuels, and SAFs. JGA received appreciation from the GHG
Protocol Secretariat for their proposal.




Hydrogen burner startup to open restaurant in Tokyo
(Japan NRG, Jan 30)
•  H2&DX Inc, a Tokyo-based startup developing hydrogen burners, plans to open a restaurant in

Tokyo in April with a fully hydrogen-fueled kitchen, Fukuda Mineyuki, the company founder, told
Japan NRG.
•  The company will also seek tenants for hydrogen-fueled kitchens.
•  In 2023, H2&DX developed and installed a hydrogen-based kitchen system to Madoka-no-Mori, a
luxury inn in Hakone township (Kanagawa pref). It uses 99.99% hydrogen contained in gas
cylinders, delivered by trucks once a week.
•  The operation cost of the inn’s kitchen increased 2.5-fold compared to conventional gas and

power systems, according to Fukuda.
• TAKEAWAY: The burner can accommodate hydrogen with lower purity but the company is forced to use
premium-grade 99.99% hydrogen for fuel cell batteries and FC vehicles, since it’s the only grade available on a
commercial basis. Similarly, most hydrogen boilers run on a lower grade 90% hydrogen as long as the gas
does not contain sulfur, nitrogen, etc.

IAEA confirms safety of Fukushima’s treated water release, first full report issued

(IAEA statement, Jan 30)
•  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) completed a safety review of TEPCO's discharge
of Fukushima NPP's treated water into the sea. The discharge was found to be consistent with
international safety standards.
•  The IAEA will continue its multiyear safety review, and will remain present at Fukushima to check
the discharge.
•  CONTEXT: China, Russia, South Korea and Fukushima’s fishermen have all spoken against the

release. In autumn, China and Russia banned Japanese seafood imports. In 2022, China was
Japan's biggest market for fish, with more than $500 mln worth of exports. Russia only accounted
for $1.7 mln worth of Japanese seafood exports. Japan plans to use the IAEA report in its talks
with China to end the latter’s ban.




Five EPCOs plan electricity rate hikes for households in March; three to drop rates
(Nikkei and Japan NRG, Jan 30)
•  Five major EPCOs plan to raise electricity rates for March billing (which relates to Feb power
usage). The five are: Chubu Electric, TEPCO, Tohoku Electric, Okinawa Electric, and Hokkaido

Electric.
•  An average household bill, as modeled by the companies themselves and based on low-voltage
rates, will be affected by the following amounts:
Forecast change in avg. household Current monthly
Company name
payment in March (¥) spend
Chubu Electric       133             ¥7,291

TEPCO                72              ¥7,560

Tohoku Electric      47              ¥7,545

Okinawa Electric     21              ¥8,009

Hokkaido Electric     7              ¥8,318

•  However, three other firms – Hokuriku, Chugoku and Shikoku Electric – are set to drop power rates
to reflect declining coal prices. The gap also stems from the more varied power supply mix the

firms use to generate power.

Chugoku Electric      -5               ¥7,197

•  Kyushu Electric and KEPCO do not plan changes. Their average household bill will remain

unchanged at ¥6,136 and ¥6,146, respectively.
•  At least four gas companies also announced increased price plans for March, reflecting price hikes
for LPG and LNG. The average monthly household gas bill will increase by around ¥100.
o  Tokyo Gas: up ¥125;
o  Shizuoka Gas: up ¥106
o  Toho Gas: up ¥133
o  Keiyo Gas: up ¥99
•  CONTEXT: The companies cited rising prices of LNG and crude oil during October to December

2023 as the reason for rate increases. Household electricity prices for major power firms consist of
two types: liberalized rates, which allow utilities to freely set prices, and regulated rates, which
require state approval.
• TAKEAWAY: The five major EPCOs that announced electricity price hikes already raised prices last year due to
the global energy crisis and yen depreciation that had an impact on the costs of LNG, coal, oil and other
commodities. Last year in May, the govt approved the requests from seven major utilities to raise monthly

electricity bills for standard households by 14% to 42% from June 2023. Those were: Tohoku Electric, Hokuriku
Electric, Chugoku Electric, Shikoku Electric, Okinawa Electric, TEPCO and Hokkaido Electric.




METI sets purchase prices for renewable capacity after FY2024
(Government data and Japan NRG, Jan 29)
•  METI’s Power Tariff Committee on procurement costs set the purchase prices under Feed-in-Tariff

for after FY2024. Below is a summary of the new price parameters introduced by the ministry.
•  In FY2025, the price for solar power was set at ¥15 / kWh for capacity under 10 kW. Outside of 10
kW, prices in FY2025 and beyond were set at ¥10 for ground-mounted PVs of a capacity under 50
kW; ¥8.9 for 50 kW and above, and ¥11.5 for roof-mounted PVs.
•  As for the solar tariff auctions, during FY2024 they will be held four times, targeting facilities with
capacity of 250 kW or more for ground-mounted installations under the FIP system. The max

supply price is set at ¥9.20 for the initial round; it will be decreased to ¥9.13, ¥9.05, and ¥8.98 in
the following rounds. The initial amount of capacity offered will be 93 MW.
•  The price for onshore wind power has now been set as far as FY2026. It was ¥14 in FY2024 and
¥13 in FY2025 for a capacity of less than 50 kW. In FY2026, the cap will drop to ¥12 via the FIT
scheme. For onshore wind capacity of over 50 kW, the same price cap will be applied but via the
FIP mechanism.

| Chugoku Electric | -5 |  |  | ¥7,197 |  |  |

•  For replacement onshore wind capacity, the price for FY2024 has been set at ¥12 / kWh. Both FIT
and FIP systems can be used. Only one auction round is planned for FY2024 with 1 GW on offer.
•  Offshore wind power projects that aren’t subject to the Act on Promoting the Utilization of Sea
Areas will be subject to a bidding system from FY2025. However, the cap on supply price will not
be disclosed before the end of FY2024.
•  For floating wind power, METI agreed to maintain both FIT and FIP prices at ¥36 / kWh at least

through FY2026.
•  For geothermal power generation, there is a similar approach. The current tariff levels were
extended for a further year to FY2026 across nearly all categories.




EGC approves OCCTO’s request for ¥12 billion loan to cover renewables fees
(Japan NRG / Denki Shimbun, Jan 30)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission approved the application submitted by
OCCTO for a ¥12 billion loan to cover monthly subsidies to power firms that purchase electricity

from renewable generators.
•  This is the first time OCCTO has applied to borrow funds. On Jan 17, it applied for the METI
minister’s approval, and expects the decision shortly. EGC operates under METI. If approved,
OCCTO should receive the funds by the end of March.
•  In its application OCCTO said the monthly "adjustment subsidy" has increased due to a decline in
the so-called avoidable costs, which are linked to wholesale electricity prices that have been
trended down. Meanwhile, income from the renewables levy has dropped after the rate of the levy

was lowered by METI.
•  The above has created a situation in which there is a gap between income and expenditure, which
could see OCCTO run out of funds.
•  CONTEXT: In 2012, Japan introduced a Feed-in Tariff (FIT) mechanism under which operators of
renewables facilities are guaranteed a fixed payment for their electricity. The power goes to the
major grids / utilities, which can utilize it or sell it on the market. The losses incurred from buying

FIT or similar electricity at fixed prices are meant to be compensated by funds raised from the
nationwide renewables levy, the unit price of which is set each year by the government. Part of the
compensation calculation, however, takes into account the so-called avoidable (also called
avoided) costs, which refers to expenditure that power utilities avoided because they procured
electricity volumes without having to spend money to generate it themselves. Since the avoidable
cost is linked to the cost of operating power plants and spot power prices, a decline in the market
price of electricity affects the adjustment subsidy.
•  According to OCCTO, it has about ¥460 billion cash on hand, but anticipates a shortfall of about

¥20 billion already in April. The difference between the income raised from the levy, etc. and the
amount paid out in adjustment subsidies in the last three months is estimated at ¥160 billion per
month.
•  If METI approves the loan, the lender and borrowing rate will be decided via a tender.

JEPX registers 40% monthly volume increase in December in day trading
(Denki Shimbun, Jan 30)
•  JEPX's Intraday Market saw a 38.2% (MoM) increase in December’s average daily volume traded,
reaching 17.38 GWh.
•  The increase was likely related to the peak demand season, which increased supply capacity, and a

growing need for replacement of older LNG-fired power plants.
•  The monthly contract also saw volumes rise 42.8% to 539 GWh, as the number of contracts was up
26.1% to 204,515.
•  In December, more capacity came online as thermal and hydropower plants that had completed
inspections and repairs resumed operations. The increase in contracts may have resulted from the
replacement of thermal power in the hour-ahead market as part of an effort to reduce fuel

consumption.
•  The monthly average contract price was down ¥1.53/ kWh to ¥12.81/ kWh. This is ¥0.41/ kWh
higher than the system price in the spot market.
•  December’s highest price was ¥45/ kWh, which was reached on Dec 5.

2024.
•  EPRX will trade all categories of adjustment power from FY2024 and cover its operating costs from
trading commissions. The founding entities of the business will also make an undisclosed cash
injection.
•  CONTEXT: Created in 2021, EPRX has hitherto been operated by a voluntary organization. Having
a business entity in charge is expected to clarify the platform’s responsibilities and speed up

decision-making.



Kyushu Electric’s Genkai NPP Unit 3 restarts after regular maintenance

(Company statement, Jan 26)
•  Kyushu Electric’s Genkai NPP Unit 3 (PWR, 1.18 GW), which has been suspended for regular
inspections, resumed power generation on Feb 2.
•  Gradual adjustments will be made to confirm the functionality of equipment, with the expectation
of returning to normal operation by Feb 29.
• TAKEAWAY: After the restart, power generation using MOX fuel was halted. This was due to difficulties in

securing plutonium from the French supplier. The inspection involved replacing MOX fuel with uranium fuel.
Power generation will proceed with uranium fuel until further notice. Kyushu Electric aims to restart pluthermal
(MOX) power generation by FY2026.

U.S., Europe and Japan urge Biden to reverse its LNG pause
(Bloomberg, Jan 29)
•  U.S., Europe, and Japan business groups urged the Biden administration to reverse its decision to

freeze approvals for new LNG export facilities licenses. They include the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, BusinessEurope, and Japan's Keidanren.
•  METI officials expressed concern about potential delays at facilities awaiting approval. Japan does
not expect an immediate impact on its LNG procurement. Yet, the govt is in discussions with U.S.
counterparts to address the situation.
•  They emphasized growing global demand for more LNG supplies. The U.S. became the top LNG

exporter in 2023, serving as a critical supplier to Europe. The impact of the approval freeze on
global gas markets is expected to be minimal until at least 2027, according to Goldman Sachs.
•  CONTEXT: U.S. President Joe Biden halted approvals for new LNG projects, a move praised by
climate activists. The pause is aimed at evaluating both economic and environmental impacts. It
could delay decisions on new projects until after the Nov election. The U.S. Dept of Energy will
conduct a review, followed by a public comment period. The pause affects at least four projects
with pending approvals.

• TAKEAWAY: Japan seeks to understand the impact of the U.S. decision on projects in which Japanese
companies have offtake agreements. One of those is Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass 2 (CP2) project, in which
JERA and INPEX both have 20-year purchase agreements for 1 million tons a year. CP2 alone would boost the
U.S. current LNG export volumes by a fifth. In Dec, the two Japanese companies had urged the U.S. to hurry
approvals for the project, mentioning its importance for Japan's energy security.





Recent ENEOS President resignation was a coup d’etat
(Zaiten, February issue)
•  CONTEXT: The publication is a monthly magazine that offers a behind the scenes look at major
corporate events and tends to offer a dramatic narrative.
•  The recent ouster of President Saito Takeshi due to a sexual harassment scandal was part of a coup
d’etat. There’s a power struggle linked to the firm’s future strategy.
•  The two most likely candidates to succeed Saito are Vice President Miyata Tomohide, the acting

president, and Vice Chair Ota Katsuyuki. The article expects the winner to be Ota because he has
no ties to the original Nippon Oil business that still forms the core of ENEOS, and because during
his brief stint as President, Ota tried to shift the group away from fossil fuels to renewables.
•  Ota oversaw the acquisition of Japan Renewable Energy Corp from Goldman Sachs and shuttered
a large oil refinery.
•  Any strong reforms at ENEOS could face a backlash, as many of its executives are from the Nippon

Oil business and are of a more traditional mindset. If the internal struggles get out of hand, METI
might step in and appoint an outsider to lead the firm.

Japan Faces Surge in Demand-Response Tech
Amid Changing Power Markets

Most government energy policies focus on supply, but as energy systems shift to
renewables, adjusting demand for electricity will become just as important.
Fortunately, this is an area that Japan has experience in, and it’s expected to develop
significantly in 2024.

On March 22, 2022, consumers in eastern Japan, including the Tokyo area, were
asked by the government to drastically reduce power usage. This came a week after a
7.4-magnitude quake off the Fukushima coast that triggered a shutdown of numerous
thermal plants. After an immediate loss of power to 2.2 million homes in central and
northern Japan, the situation soon recovered.

Then suddenly came a bout of unseasonably cold weather that threatened to
overwhelm the energy grid. This situation was resolved thanks to a now familiar
practice of setsuden, or appeals for energy conservation from the government and
power utilities.

The approach has been used numerous times in the past – most famously after the
March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami that also sparked the Fukushima nuclear
accident. Despite a scorching summer in 2011, demand for electricity in the Tokyo
area registered volumes of close to a quarter below a year earlier.

Starting this year, the government has decided to make shifting the time of power
usage a more regular feature of the power market in Japan, and not just as a tool for
navigating short-term supply pinches. In April, big power users will be required to
start reporting their demand-response (DR) activities.

Case Study: March 2022
The energy shortage in March 2022 was illustrative for a number of reasons, one of
which was that a number of foreseeable and unexpected factors collided to
exacerbate the situation.

In addition to halting the operation of 14 thermal power generation units immediately
after the March 16, 2022 earthquake, with some of them offline for weeks thereafter,
the main power utilities involved – TEPCO and Tohoku Electric – had to contend with
a spell of gloomy weather that notably cut generation from solar farms. At the same
time, a number of thermal power plants had undergone regular maintenance work,
which is usually scheduled for March because it comes after the peak power demand
winter period.


With power supply severely constrained, TEPCO was down to its last backup option of
pumped storage hydro units to keep the lights on in the capital. The situation was
dire. To avert blackouts, TEPCO asked companies with onsite power generation to
boost output. It also asked about 400 manufacturers of raw materials such as steel,
chemicals, and industrial gas, to reduce power use.

This effort to shift power consumption is one example of DR – an attempt to influence
power use by consumers to complement actions on the power supply side.

While the March 2022 event is irregular, its lessons are more applicable on a more
daily basis. As more variable renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are
added to the grid, there’s an increasing need to match supply and demand. Changes
in weather, accidents at power plants, as well as troubles with transmission lines can
also impact supply.

Rather than relying on new generation capacity to improve resiliency in time of a
supply crunch, DR programs can be deployed to let power users play a role in
balancing supply and demand at a cheaper cost. Consumers can take measures such
as shifting their power demand from peak times to less congested periods and
charging batteries. In return for helping to balance the grid, consumers can receive
monetary or price incentives.

Policy action
Several policy developments are pushing further DR implementation. A revision to the
act on energy saving that took effect in May 2022 is expected to promote the roles
that DR can play since it stipulates large-volume power consumers to report efforts to
optimize power demand.

Starting FY2024, it will become mandatory for large-volume power users to report
how many times they have implemented DR programs in the past year. Starting
FY2025, they’ll be also asked – though on a voluntary basis – to report more details,
such as how much power demand they were able to shift by implementing DR.


Of course, such cooperation should be rewarded. Power consumers – whether
commercial, industrial, or residential – can be compensated by roughly two types of
mechanisms called “economic DR.” One is a “price-based” type in which rates are
increased during peak periods. The other is an “incentive-based” mechanism in
which customers agree to shift power demand based on a contract with power
companies and get compensated, says METI.

Mechanisms and trading
Individual efforts to reduce or shift electricity use in DR programs are supported by
“aggregators” in charge of controlling the flow of electricity on behalf of power

Conserved electricity through DR efforts can be traded on power markets. Until last
year, TSOs procured power sources for category I' in order to prepare for once-in-a-
decade level of cold or hot weather through a public offering of ancillary services,
which are used to ensure the reliability of power systems. The share of DR in procured
capacity in that category was on the rise, reaching about 2.5 GW (about 66% of the
total) in 2023, said METI.

Starting this year, the equivalent of category I' power sources will be procured from
the capacity market following rule changes. A total of 4.15 GW of dispatchable
resources have been awarded for FY2024, 4.75 GW for FY2025 and 5.84 GW for
FY2026. The capacity market is designed for procurement of power capacity through
a four-year forward auction; the dispatchable resources include demand response,
storage batteries, and any power generation with a capacity of less than 1 MW.

Furthermore, the conserved electricity can be sold on the balancing market. Low-
voltage power resources such as residential storage batteries, EVs, and heat pumps
have not been allowed to take part in the balancing market. The government,
however, will change this and allow them to start trading in FY2026. This will expand
the scope of DR participation for residential power users. Currently, they can take part
in the “economic DR” programs mentioned above.

DR-ready as the wave of the future
METI is also looking at how to promote residential equipment such as ACs, heat
pumps, storage batteries, and EV chargers to be “DR-ready” so their usage can be
controlled remotely. Some ACs sold in Japan are DR-ready. Adding the remote
control function to all ACs would help since such equipment accounts for the largest
share - more than 30% - in residential power use.

In April, TEPCO will launch a two-month DR field study to encourage customers to
shift to daytime, instead of nighttime, when switching on residential heat pump water
heaters. This would boost daytime electricity use at the time when generation of
renewable energy, such as solar power, is traditionally higher. Doing so could help the
utility avoid curtailing renewable energy output

Participants can earn loyalty points worth ¥2,500, to help compensate for the
expected increase in their electricity bills for shifting to daytime instead of nighttime
use when rates are cheaper. The utility also plans to announce in February details of a
separate DR program for households that won’t require water heater ownership.

Another positive development that encourages demand response is the planned
nationwide installation of next-generation smart meters that begins in FY2025. This
will allow for collecting data from demand-side resources such as inverters for solar
panels and EV chargers, and this could increase the volume of resources for the
balancing market.

Switching on residential water heaters at night or setting the air conditioner’s
temperature lower in summer may sound like a small step, but given the numbers of
these machines already in use in Japan – 90 million ACs, and 5 million heat pump
water heaters – there’s the potential for the aggregated capacity to help balance
power supply and demand.

As Japan strives to hit 2030 interim climate targets, as well as final ones in 2050, every
effort at energy efficiency will be crucial to realizing those goals.

Jobs in Japan: Increased Market Volatility = Increased Mobility?

Large scale auctions for offshore wind sites, long-term decarbonisation auctions for
energy storage capacity, and CfD scheme for hydrogen projects are facilitating the
growth of various clean energy projects across Japan’s energy systems, and attracting
healthy interest from domestic and international firms alike.

The win or lose nature of these schemes presents challenges for employers and
employees alike. As a company seeking to win an auction, building up a skilled team
with technical expertise and commercial know-how is necessary, however deciding
which positions to prioritize, and what size of team to invest in can be challenging.

For employees, managing the risk of joining a firm that may or may not win a project
is a tough choice. How can you ensure that the work you do adds value to your CV
regardless of auction results?

Desire to work on winning projects
Naturally, offshore wind industry talent wants to work on projects that will be realized.
In the three Round 2 offshore areas to be granted rights in December of 2023, nine
firms across three consortiums were successful. One more offshore area will be
decided by March of this year.


Over 20 firms will ultimately be unsuccessful with their Round 2 bids, and multiple
other firms have worked for over a year to develop projects in preparation for their
bids, only to decide against bidding for various economic and competitive reasons.
The impact was quick in coming. Within two weeks of the results, about a dozen
employees of a major Japanese developer that failed to secure their project have left
the company.

One of the winners, however, announced over 30 newly opened positions in the same
timeframe and are now interviewing dozens of professionals each week. Over 50% of
professionals who submitted applications to one multinational developer prior to the
auction result withdrew their interest within a week of that firm failing to secure a win
in their offshore zone.

The high costs to develop projects, and all or nothing risk that comes with capital
intensive segments such as offshore wind, reveal the risks that employees face. This
can be demonstrated by large-scale downsizing and complete market exits for some
multinational developers, as well as a large number of Round 1 bidders opting to sit
out of Round 2 auctions.

With massive oversubscription of energy storage projects in Japan’s long-term
decarbonisation auctions, the potential for a repeat of this pattern of talent drain to
project winners is high. Notably, this trend was less pronounced in the solar boom a
decade ago.

Under that FIT market scheme, developers were able to secure projects year round,
leading to more consistent, albeit smaller wins that allowed businesses to maintain a
team that matched their portfolio. The annual auction system creates a fair and level
playing field and increases visibility for developers; however, the balance of building
and retaining talent becomes more challenging.

Hiring enough to win while managing cost
Developing a team that’s capable of developing quality projects and submitting bids
with a high chance of success is a serious investment. The challenge is that there’s
nothing to pay for that investment until project wins are secured. So, how to build a
strong team and keep costs down?

A few things to keep in mind:
•  A team that lacks strong local capabilities will make finding and securing
development partners more difficult;
•  Due to the intense workload in the months leading up to bid submissions, the
work-life balance and strain on a team that’s too lean can cause internal
problems;
•  On the other hand, the cost of salaries, social insurance, equipment and
office space for 40, 50+ staff is hard to justify if the bid is unsuccessful and the
next opportunity is another 12 months away.

Talent retention in a cutthroat market
As previously mentioned, strong talent wants to work on projects that will be
developed and constructed. Losing talent to winners after a tender result is
announced is a risk that’s impossible to eliminate. However, steps can be taken to
mitigate this risk and keep top performers under your roof.


•  Clear vision and long-term commitment. Talent is more likely to stay if there’s
a clear roadmap and pipeline of projects in the next auction, or early stage
projects not yet subject to auctions. Holding meetings on the firm’s future
direction and not committing to the next auction is a sure way to get a stack
of resignation letters on your desk.
•  Get your team involved at a regional level. Multinational firms primarily hire
bilingual talent. If yours has interest in other APAC markets, giving your team
the chance to have input on projects outside Japan significantly increases
your chances of retaining them in the case you fail to secure a project in the
Japanese auction systems.
•  Diversity of projects. Firms that have developed a range of asset types hold a
different risk profile and can repurpose talent if a key auction-based project is
unsuccessful.

Employees: How to secure your value regardless of company results?
This is one of the most common concerns we see for professionals moving to firms
dealing with project materialization risk, irrespective of whether it’s in wind, energy
storage, hydrogen or other areas. There is a oft-held view that if a firm fails to secure a
project, then the experience and value of its team members falls behind. This would
make it harder to secure employment.

At Titan, our view is that this risk is minimal, due to the fact that these markets are
young and demand for talent is high, and that inherently there are more losers than
winners in such auction systems.

Some points to consider when choosing a firm and selecting a role to ensure that you
continue to build value regardless of company results:
•  Wider roles are better. Since many segments of energy transition sectors are
in their infancy, employers gravitate toward talent who can wear multiple
hats. Having the ability and mindset to work broadly, and communicate
across functions and languages, is a key asset.
•  Take on roles that shift with the project. Energy projects are divided into
phases – if you are able to stick with a project through origination, into
development and then into execution, you’ll build more value than through
sticking to origination repeatedly.
•  Look at that firm’s commitment. If it’s strong for multiple projects over a long
period of time, you’ll likely have workstreams in more than one project;
hence, in case your main project dissolves, you’ll be able to pick up work in
the next projects, rather than having ‘dead time’ while your next steps are
decided.
•  Target multiple small wins. For example, we see a trend of professionals in
offtake / CPPA favoring solar or BESS over offshore wind for the reason that
they can start racking up a track record of small wins, rather than leaving
themselves open to the binary risk inherent in larger, more complex offshore
projects.

Does job ‘hoppiness’ matter less?
One of the age old questions in Japan is how long a professional needs to remain
with a firm in order not to be considered a ‘job hopper’. In the current market, this
notion is changing from ‘time in role’ to ‘achievements in role.’


As there’s a larger number of firms in the Japanese energy market looking to develop
projects in an increasingly competitive landscape, this naturally correlates to increased
mobility. Rather than looking at years in role when judging candidates, it becomes
more important to look at years in function, and put the spotlight on what that person
has achieved even if it was across two or three different employers.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific, and all that impact markets in the
region.

Australia / Renewable energy
EDP Renewables acquired local renewables firm ITP Development, including 1.5 GW
of renewable energy assets with a pipeline of wind and solar projects, and the option
to co-locate battery energy storage systems (BESS).

Bangladesh / LNG
Summit Group said that in 2023 it inked two agreements to supply 1.5 mln tons of
LNG annually to the energy-starved south Asian country (population 170 mln) and a
Floating Storage Regasification Unit with a capacity of 170,000 m3.

China / Renewable energy
In 2024, China's installed wind and solar capacity will overtake coal for the first time.
The China Electricity Council said wind and solar would make up around 40% of
installed power generation capacity, compared with coal's expected 37%. In 2023,
wind and solar were 36% of capacity, and coal was just under 40%.

India / Green hydrogen
NTPC Green Energy inked a MoU with the state of Maharashtra to develop green
hydrogen projects with a potential investment of $10.5 billion. The deal includes
derivatives like green ammonia and green methanol of around 1 mln tons annual
capacity, as well as 2 GW of pumped storage projects and the development of
renewable energy projects.

Malaysia / Energy trading
State-owned oil and gas company Petronas is hiring traders to expand its derivatives
business. Building out derivatives trading would represent an attempt to develop a
more sophisticated trading operation, alongside existing production and refining
businesses.

Malaysia / Natural gas
TotalEnergies will buy OMV's 50% stake in Malaysia-focused SapuraOMV for $903
million. The main assets are its 40% stake in the natural gas block SK408, and a 30%
stake in block SK310, both located offshore of Sarawak.

Philippines / Tidal power
Inyanga Marine Energy Group was selected to build SE Asia’s first tidal power
generation plant, a 1-MW station in the Philippines. Completion is planned for 2025.

Singapore / Power systems
The Energy Market Authority selected YTL PowerSeraya to develop a 600-MW
hydrogen-ready Combined Cycle Gas Turbine, to be commissioned by end-2027. YTL
will build, operate and own the project.

Southeast Asia / Solar power
BlackRock’s Climate Finance Partnership fund is partnering with Ditrolic Energy to
develop solar power across Asia-Pacific. The fund, which has raised $670 mln, will
accelerate Ditrolic’s 1 GW-plus solar pipeline in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and
Philippines.

South Korea / Offshore floating wind
Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) signed a deal for floating wind structures
with HSG Sungdong for its 1.5 GW Haewoori offshore wind project in South Korea.
The non-binding MoU will explore opportunities to optimize production of floating
foundations.
