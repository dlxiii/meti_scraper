Japan to propose carbon intensity standard for hydrogen at G7

(Japan NRG, April 5)
•  The govt will propose to set the definition and standard of carbon intensity of hydrogen at the
upcoming G7 meeting. A global carbon intensity standard is essential to build mutual verification
systems, to expand trade and to diversify supply sources.
•  CONTEXT: Currently, hydrogen made from coal or natural gas is called “blue hydrogen”, and
hydrogen made from renewable energy as “green hydrogen”. Hydrogen made from nuclear is
“pink hydrogen”, and hydrogen made from methane is “turquoise hydrogen”. However, there is
no definitive agreement on this issue. Japan seeks to place priority on CO2 numbers rather than

colors.
•  Japan is expected to propose 3.4 kg of CO2/ kg of hydrogen as low-carbon hydrogen, which is in
line with the EU standard.
• TAKEAWAY: METI has unveiled the outline of the revised hydrogen strategy which included a carbon intensity
standardization, a new goal of 15 GW electrolysis capacity by 2030, and a new 2040 supply goal of 12 million
tons. METI had a 2030 goal of 3 million tons and a 2050 goal of 20 million tons, but not for 2040.

•  International agreement on this standard will help Japan import hydrogen and export
manufacturing equipment.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan Gas Association urges rules on carbon footprint measurement of e-fuels
(JGA statement, April 6)

o  The Japan Gas Association sent a formal request to the MoE to speed up writing carbon
footprint measurement rules for e-methane, SAF and other fuels made from recycled
carbon.
o  CONTEXT: The request comes ahead of the G7 Climate Ministers Meeting in Sapporo
next week (April 15 and 16).




METI starts enforcement of new rule to annul idle FIT-approved projects
(Denki Shimbun, April 4)
•  METI said it has started enforcing its new rule to cancel the FIT agreement for projects that have
not started construction one year or more after their stated start of operations. The FIT contract is
based on the project operator’s stated timeline.
•  CONTEXT: Feed-in Tariff (FIT) guarantees payment for electricity generated at the power facility at

a certain price level for a long period, usually 20 years. Some developers won an FIT contract at
high prices in the early stage of the program but then did not go on to build the facilities.
•  The revised FIT Law came into effect in April 2022.
•  At the end of FY2022 (which is March 31, 2023), 50,000 projects to build 4 GW of capacity did not
meet the revised law criteria and therefore could lose their FIT approval, according to METI.

•  During FY2023, officials estimate that another 10,000 projects will face the same fate. The ministry
will send out warning notices to the related parties.
• TAKEAWAY: The reasons why companies don’t begin operation before the deadline are numerous.
Sometimes, it is because developers hope to get lower equipment prices by waiting. Others simply hope to
flip the FIT permit to other parties at a profit. But delays cause problems for the grid, which must keep space in

reserve for agreed FIT capacity. Also, delays impact Japan’s targets for the rollout of renewable energy.


JFTC formalizes green competition guidelines after revisions

(Japan NRG, March 31)
•  The Japan Fair Trade Commission formalized green competition guidelines, reflecting public
feedback.
•  The changes include a clarification for initiatives to reduce Scope 3 emissions, asking transport
service providers to cut emissions and excluding those with high emissions. This is unlikely to be
anticompetitive behavior.
•  CONTEXT: The guidelines clarify sustainability initiatives that are compliant (or not) with the

Antimonopoly Act (AMA). They were opened for a month-long public consultation in January.
• TAKEAWAY: Ruling party lawmaker Amari Akira and some govt officials have been asking for wider AMA
exemptions, possibly by amending the AMA, saying companies need to collaborate, not compete to speed up
large hydrogen and ammonia projects. Some critics describe the JFTC as “a mini-METI”. On the other hand,
lawyers told Japan NRG that it failed to provide thought leadership for the future, as the guidelines were
reprints of past case studies.



Govt calls for JCM project proposals

(Government statement, April 6)
•  The govt calls for proposals of projects for the Joint Crediting Mechanism. The projects cover
decarbonizing technologies, products, systems, services and infrastructure and other mitigation
actions in developing countries.
•  Applications close Nov 30. The govt budgeted ¥15 billion for JCM projects in 2023-2025. Since
2013, there have been 228 projects.



IAEA: No need for further technical review of Fukushima water release
(IAEA statement, April 5)
•  No further review of TEPCO’s plan to release contaminated water into the sea is needed, the
International Atomic Energy Agency said in its report of the November 2022 safety review mission
to Fukushima NPP.
•  The review assessed safety aspects of the systems for discharging the treated water.
•  IAEA will publish its full conclusions before the water release.

• TAKEAWAY: The discharge of treated water is scheduled for early this summer. But the IAEA will issue the final
report only in a few months; thus, TEPCO might wait to execute the discharge until after the report’s
publication.

Two major EPCs in Japan join forces on domestic SAF plants
(Company Statement, March 31)
•  JGC and Toyo Engineering (TEC) will work on orders for front-end engineering design (FEED) and
engineering, procurement and constructions (EPC) services for domestic sustainable aviation fuel

(SAF) plants.
•  JGC specializes in production supply planning, and TEC specializes in technology for SAF
production. Both are experienced in building large oil refineries and chemical/petrochemical plants
in Japan and overseas.
•  CONTEXT: Japan has set a target to replace 10% of jet fuel used by domestic airlines with SAF by
2030. Domestic SAF demand is expected to grow from 300,000 kiloliters in 2025 to 171 million

kiloliters in 2030 – nearly six-fold. Domestic oil refining companies and others plan to start
construction of SAF plants between 2024 and 2027, investing several hundred billion yen from the
government's Green Innovation Fund.


Idemitsu and Chile’s HIF Global partner in e-fuel production and imports

(Japan NRG, April 5)
•  Idemitsu and HIF Global signed a MoU on imports and production of e-fuel supplies, including
possible JVs to produce synthetic gasoline and SAF in Japan.
•  Idemitsu plans to import synthetic methanol, the feed for synthetic gasoline and SAF, from the
Americas and produce them in Japan.
•  Sale of the e-fuel and production at Idemitsu refineries are planned for 2025.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s GX strategy calls for synthetic fuels to enter commercial operation by 2030.
• TAKEAWAY: Idemitsu partnered with HIF because its technologies are almost ready for commercialization and

are the quickest e-fuel solution, the company told Japan NRG. HIF production costs are believed to be above
current gasoline price levels considering the cost of green hydrogen. Idemitsu may need government
subsidies to commercialize e-fuel products.

HIF makes e-fuel from synthetic methanol produced from CO2 and green hydrogen. HIF’s technologies are
different from the methanation-based technologies developed by Hitachi Zosen and IHI to produce e-
methane, another type of e-fuel.
Idemitsu also told the media that the export of CO2 captured in Japan to HIF facilities overseas is also under

discussion.

Itochu sets up domestic jet fuel blending supply chain and Neat SAF import, Japan’s first
(Company statement, March 30)
•  Itochu started importing neat SAF from Finland’s Neste, and began supplying SAF to Chubu
Centrair International Airport, the third airport where Itochu has SAF supply bases. The other two

are Narita and Haneda.
•  The SAF supply chain is blended with conventional fossil jet fuel from Fuji Oil.
•  CONTEXT: Neat SAF is a jet fuel made from biomass materials. It requires blending with other jet
fossil fuels and is mainly produced in Europe. Neste OYJ’s SAF can be blended up to 50%.



City of Saga uses FAME biodiesel fuel for construction vehicles

(New Energy Business News, April 3)
•  Nishimatsu Construction and Saga City (Saga Pref) verified next-gen biodiesel fuel produced by an
incineration plant that can be used for construction vehicles. This biodiesel fuel is equivalent to
light (diesel) oil, processed through decarboxylation.
•  Saga City has been using FAME biodiesel fuel (FAME = fatty acid methyl ester) for city buses since
2010.
•  Nishimatsu and the city will continue work to expand use of next-gen biodiesel fuel.


















Osaka Gas and MHI to collaborate on CO2 value chain for CCUS
(Company statement, March 31)
•  Osaka Gas and MHI will study developing a carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) value
chain. Captured CO2 will be transported by ship, also overseas.
•  Both will study how to capture CO2 from industries such as steel, cement, chemicals and

petrochemicals. The CO2 will be used for e-methane and underground storage.
•  They will also study how to quantify the environmental value of CCUS through CO2NNEX, a digital
platform being developed by MHI and IBM Japan.
•  CONTEXT: Environmental value refers to a certified reduction of emissions that can be packaged
into a sellable product, such as a carbon credit. Buyers use such products to cut their own
emissions total.

KEPCO to study whether to develop hydrogen or ammonia with Canada
(Nikkei Asia, April 7)
•  Kansai Electric is partnering with Canada’s ATCO to conduct a feasibility study on the production,
transportation and import of either hydrogen or ammonia from Canada.

•  Details on the investment and the fuel amount to be purchased are not yet known; the decision
whether hydrogen or ammonia will be based on production cost, etc.
•  After the feasibility study finishes later this year, production facilities could start up on a trial basis
in 2029. KEPCO is also conducting a study on importing Australian-made hydrogen to be burnt
with natural gas at a power plant in Hyogo Pref in 2030.
•  CONTEXT: Kansai Electric will start a study to procure hydrogen or ammonia from Canadian

energy infrastructure company ATCO. While ATCO undertakes the production, Kansai Electric
would be in charge of transportation, import facility and final use.












Toyota to sell 1.5 million EV by 2026, produce in the U.S.

(Nikkei, April 7)
•  Toyota will introduce 10 new EV models by 2026, bringing its annual global sales to 1.5 million
units. The company will begin local production in the U.S. in 2025.
•  The company will produce a three-row SUV in the U.S. It plans to build a new battery plant and
increase production.
•  In addition to hybrid vehicles (HVs), the company will maintain FCVs (fuel cell vehicles) and
hydrogen engine vehicles in its strategy. Toyota will also accelerate its EV strategy.
•  CONTEXT: Toyota's EV strategy has so far been to sell 3.5 million units in 30 years and to
introduce 30 new models, and this is a sign of the progress it has made along the way.




e-Mobility Power to set up 1,100 EV chargers at service/ parking areas on highways by 2025
(Company statement, March 29)
•  e-Mobility Power and three of NEXCO Group’s companies plan to double the number of EV/PHEV
chargers at service and parking areas on highways by 2025.
•  The company has 500 sites for EV chargers, and that will grow to 1,100 in two years.

Chiyoda and Samsung sign MoU on SPERA Hydrogen in Korea
(Company statement, March 31)
•  Chiyoda signed an MoU with Samsung C&T to explore opportunities with Chiyoda’s SPERA
Hydrogen Technology in Korea, and to expand the business in global markets.

•  SPERA Hydrogen or Methylcyclohexane (MCH) is made from toluene and hydrogen, and allows
hydrogen to be stored and transported at ambient temperature and pressure.



Japanese aluminum firm switches power at 17 factories to renewables

(Company statement, March 27)
•  From April 2023, UACJ, a Japanese aluminum group, decided to purchase 220 GWh of electricity
from 100% renewable sources for use at its 17 manufacturing plants in Japan. As a result, 63% of
UACJ’s operations in Japan achieved RE100 for Scope 2 emissions.
•  In addition, the group plans to cut CO2 output by 100,000 tons a year.
• TAKEAWAY: This appears to be a major power purchasing agreement. However, the processing of aluminum
raw materials, which is what UACJ does, involves re-melting metal. For that, LNG is traditionally used as the
main source of heat. The initiatives UACJ will take to reduce gas-derived emissions would certainly be of

interest to industry stakeholders working to cut down the carbon footprint of the aluminum value chain.
Meanwhile, rising energy and labor costs will need to be passed onto product prices. The question is, will
business models of low-margin products, such as aluminum sheets used to make beverage cans, allow for
prices to be raised?



German Pharma plant in Yamagata Pref to end fossil fuel use
(Gas Energy News, April 3)
•  Kirsch Energy Service, a company co-owned by JAPEX and Yamagata Gas, began providing
energy services to the Yamagata Plant in Yamagata Pref. The plant is owned by German
pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim (BIS).

•  This is the first energy service locally to use a gas cogeneration system, which is expected to
reduce CO2 emissions by up to 21%.
•  Kirsch built an energy center on the BIS site, with three 700 kW gas engines.



JOGMEC’s reckless expansion into decarbonization

(Sentaku, April-2023 issue)
•  CONTEXT: Sentaku is a popular monthly magazine that covers business and politics. It often
covers the chatter inside government organizations and big companies and likes to wade in on
controversial topics. This is not an editorial, but many of its articles convey a strong opinion.
•  The METI-affiliated Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) has recklessly
expanded its business scope to carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities, hydrogen production,
and offshore wind power.
•  By rushing into such risky sectors, in which it has little experience, JOGMEC will likely amass bad

assets just like Japan National Oil Corp did decades back.

•  CCS isn’t the trump card for decarbonization hailed by the media and government. Serious
questions hang over its technology and economic viability.
•  Helping METI to survive is a big factor behind JOGMEC’s expansion. Many METI projects concern
procuring or using CO2, which contrasts with the decarbonization efforts of other agencies. METI
fears these agencies will take lead roles in the future.

•  It’s possible that a JOGMEC-supported structure is set up in which trading houses and companies
bring risky CCS and hydrogen-production projects to Japan.

Kansai Electric set to have 7 reactors online for 2023 summer peak demand, first since 2011
(Denki Shimbun, April 5)
•  Kansai Electric said that with Takahama NPP Units 1 and 2 ready to supply power from June 3 and
July 15, respectively, it is counting on being able to operate seven reactors during the summer
2023 peak demand period.
•  The utility expects to have all four units at Takahama NPP online, as well as Units 3 and 4 at Ohi

NPP, and Units 3 of Mihama NPP.
•  This is the first time Kansai Electric will operate seven reactors in 12 years since the Fukushima
accident. The seven have a total capacity of 6.58 GW. The utility expects a capacity factor of 78.4%
for the facilities, the first time since 2010 that the ratio has exceeded 70%.
•  Five of the seven reactors are scheduled to shut down for periodic inspection after the peak
demand period.
o  Ohi Unit 4 stops in August 2023

o  Takahama Unit 3 in September 2023
o  Mihama Unit 3 in October 2023
o  Takahama Unit 4 in December 2023
o  Ohi Unit 3 in February 2024.
•  The remaining two reactors – Takahama Units 1 and 2 – will operate beyond this period since they
would only have restarted in June and July of 2023.
• TAKEAWAY: In Japan, reactors must undergo a regular inspection every 13 months. Utilities try to manage

their operating schedules so as to have the nuclear stations online during the peak summer and winter periods.
Inspection times differ depending on the age and condition of the facility with some taking less than 60 days
while others more than 150 days.


Cartel leniency triggers resentment against Kansai Electric

(Japan NRG, Diamond Online, April 4)
•  Many power operators are unhappy with the Japan Fair Trade Commission’s (JFTC) decision to
exempt from penalties accused cartel member Kansai Electric (KEPCO). The big players in the
collusion have more information to offer to the authorities and escape penalties, several lawyers
told Japan NRG.
•  Kansai Electric acknowledges violating the antitrust law and will report to the Electricity and Gas
Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) on how it plans to improve compliance.
•  Rivalry between Kansai Electric and Chubu Electric is intense; KEPCO’s information was partly the

basis of charges against Chubu. KEPCO has a cost advantage thanks to a large nuclear power fleet
and may poach Chubu’s customers.
•  CONTEXT: On March 30, the JFTC charged Chugoku Electric, Kyushu Electric, Chubu Electric and
subsidiaries of the latter two companies with forming a cartel on power rates for business users.
• TAKEAWAY: Some lawyers who do not serve the power sector also say that the present leniency system has
flaws.

METI delays power tariff increase sought by EPCOs until after June
(Nikkei, April 6)
•  The electricity price hike requested by Tohoku, Hokuriku, Chugoku, Shikoku and Okinawa power
companies, which was to start from April, will be pushed back until after June, because METI asked

the companies to recalculate their fuel costs.
•  METI will decide on the start and the level of the tariff hikes together with the Consumer Affairs
Agency. The utilities initially asked for the higher tariffs to be in place from April or May.
• TAKEAWAY: Power companies are suffering from steep fuel cost increases. But PM Kishida has put pressure
on companies to rein in price increases in part because of local elections this month.

• Still, the govt’s position seems inconsistent. On the one hand it espouses a fully liberalized power market and
strongly encourages competition, but on the other hand it keeps a partial tariff system in place through which
it can regulate certain power prices.



MLIT designates Niigata Port as Japan’s fifth offshore “wind base port”
(Denki Shimbun, April 7)
•  The Subcommittee on Developing Offshore Wind Power designated Niigata as an offshore “wind
base port” that can assemble and maintain offshore wind equipment.

•  Niigata is the fifth port in Japan to have such a status, after Akita Port, Noshiro Port, (Akita Pref),
Kashima Port (Ibaraki Pref), and Kita-Kyushu Port (Fukuoka Pref).
•  Niigata Port will invest ¥ 9.1 billion to improve the port facilities, so that 15 MW class wind turbines
can be assembled. Niigata Pref plans two offshore wind projects, at Murakami City and Tainai City.


EGC issues advisory to Chugoku Electric on JEPX trades

(Government statement, March 31)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) issued an advisory to Chugoku
Electric after the latter did not disclose a decrease in output at three of its power stations as
required by the Electricity Business Act. The cuts directly impact trading on the Japan Electric
Power Exchange (JEPX).
•  The company lowered the output because it was running low on fuel stocks, and sourced

additional volumes of power from the spot market at high prices.
•  The company will submit a compliance follow-up report to the EGC by April 30.
•  CONTEXT: The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) said its recent probe discovered that
unnamed EPCOs (former regional power monopolies) were manipulating JEPX prices. The JFTC
handed over the case to the EGC.
• TAKEAWAY: The EGC has received complaints around JEPX transactions in the past, but had insisted there
were no problems to address. Antitrust authorities seem to disagree and the JFTC continues to point out

issues to the EGC. Later this year, JFTC plans to release the full results of a fact-finding survey around spot
power trades. The survey was launched in December last year. While a survey cannot lead to penalties for
corporate misconduct, it does push companies to act to correct their behavior.
There are mixed views in the market on how the situation will develop. A lawyer advising EPCOs believes

ANRE/METI will look to seize the initiatives and rewrite power sector rules, which should expand the

authorities of the EGC and give them more enforcement powers. Whether the antitrust officials continue to be
a catalyst for change, or hand the initiative over to METI, is also unclear.

Since the EGC is relatively new, when it was formed it was comprised mostly of ANRE officials. The EGC
continues to recruit staff from ANRE and METI, as well as from the JFTC. Staff from those government entities
stay at the EGC for several years before returning to their original ministries and agencies. Some experts say
this weakens the ability of the EGC to act as a strong sector oversight body.



METI to hold first Long-Term Decarbonized Power Source Auction in Jan 2024
(Denki Shimbun, April 6)
•  The govt will hold its first Long-Term Decarbonized Power Source Auction in January next year.
The new auction system will be operated by OCCTO and slot in as part of the greater Capacity

Market system.
•  CONTEXT: The purpose of the Long-Term Decarbonized Power Source Auction is to support
investment in non-fossil generation. The auction system was created so that operators can have a
certain guarantee around future revenue, while giving power retailers a chance to lock in future
supplies.
•  The first auction will offer as much as 4 GW of non-fossil power capacity. The size of future auction
rounds will depend on interest from the industry.

• TAKEAWAY: Investment in new power capacity in Japan has slowed, both in thermal and renewables
generation. This is one attempt to reverse the trend. In addition to this new system, METI wants an auction
system to part-fund 6 GW of new LNG-fired capacity within three years, which it sees as important to balance
Japan’s power system.



NRA to temporary halt review of JAPC’s Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 restart
(Nikkei, April 5)
•  The NRA suspended its review of whether JAPC’s Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 is fit to restart. The regulator
said the suspension is in force until the company rectifies its issues. JAPC has been given until late

August to do so.
•  Should JAPC fail to meet the deadline, the NRA will stop the review entirely. This will mean the
reactor will have to be decommissioned.
•  CONTEXT: JAPC applied in November 2015 for a review to restart Tsuruga Unit 2. The main point
of contention was whether the facility sits on top of an active fault. In 2019, the NRA claimed that
the utility failed to provide answers for over 1,000 points that it raised and in 2020 the regulator
said the geological data it received from JAPC had been tampered with.
•  The NRA only restarted this review after a two-year suspension in December 2022. The nuclear

operator is on its last chance to salvage the review and restart process.
• TAKEAWAY: Even if JAPC gets NRA approval to restart Unit 2, its track record suggests that it will be very
difficult to get approval for a restart from the local govt. That then puts into question the viability of other
JAPC plants and future construction projects.

PART I:
Can Japan Return to the Market with Innovative Solar Technology?

In the 2000s, the solar industry was dominated by Japanese engineering and
innovation. Solar manufacturers such as Sharp, Kyocera, Sanyo (now Panasonic) and
Mitsubishi Electric were leading suppliers worldwide, and they garnered more than
half of the global market.

Fast forward to 2023, and Japan’s once vaunted solar panel industry, which was the
envy of the green energy world, is in the doldrums, barely hanging onto life. While the
overall volume of the global solar market has increased exponentially, Japan’s left
with a tiny market share as Chinese manufacturers race ahead.

While Sharp Corp still produces solar cells, in 2016 it was acquired by Taiwan’s Hon
Hai Precision Industry. Panasonic stopped production of solar panels in 2021; Kyocera
also stopped domestic production in 2017. Mitsubishi Electric started to use imported
solar cells from 2018. In fact, as of 2022, only one small Japanese firm makes
conventional monocrystalline silicon solar cells.

























This sad state of affairs recently culminated with the announcement by energy major
Idemitsu that its subsidiary Solar Frontier will stop manufacturing solar equipment.
Solar Frontier was the last active Japanese player in the solar equipment space, and
its exit basically means that Japan has raised the white flag on the solar tech that’s
currently in commercial exploitation.

Given this precarious situation, it might be easy to write off Japan as a solar market
player. Indeed, how could it possibly catch up with China and India, both of whom are
making massive investments in solar R&D and manufacturing, and which enjoy a big
advantage thanks to lower labor costs, state support, and a huge domestic market.

But just when it seemed that all was lost, a leap in innovation has led to breakthroughs
in next-generation solar power. According to patent data and a survey of industry
participants, Japanese manufacturers believe they could stage a comeback.


The historical context: Japan as a solar pioneer
Today, there is only one maker of conventional (monocrystalline silicon) solar cells in
Japan: Choshu Industry Co. But there are at least nine Japanese firms pioneering
next-gen tech known as the perovskite solar cell (PSC).

PSC is expected by its supporters to turbo charge the energy transition in Japan and
globally. And according to data by Energy Monitor, the leading solar PV patent
publishers in recent years are from Japan.

If the PSC makers are successful, this would make some return to form for Japan’s
solar industry, whose story has seen many ups and downs since it began some 70
years ago.
















In 1954, the Tokyo-based Nippon Electronics Corporation (NEC) was the first in Japan
to develop and launch the use of monocrystalline silicon cells, which are the most
commonly used in commercially available solar panels. Japan’s first solar system was
installed at the wireless station of Tohoku Electric in 1958.

In those early years, visionaries were able to find ways to create and utilize solar
products, such as wireless base stations in remote areas. As early as 1963, Sharp
began large-scale production of solar equipment.

The solar industry made a very slow start due to high costs, low reliability, and low
power generation capacity per cell. There was meager demand for solar products
except in remote places. The world was then flush with cheap and plentiful crude oil,
and the global population was under 4 billion. Only a small number of countries were
highly industrialized. Energy demand was simply much less compared to today.

20

Then, in the wake of the Arab-Israeli war, the Middle Eastern oil crisis hit in October
1973. In circumstances somewhat similar to 2022, crude oil prices quickly rose 300%
by March 1974. This was followed by a second oil crisis in 1979. Both oil shocks left
economic depression and inflation in their wake, making the 1970s a lost decade.

During years of cheap oil before 1973, Japan’s electrical system had been largely
dependent on oil-burning thermal power plants. The oil shock convinced Japanese
industry and policymakers that alternative energy sources were needed, and that the
country had to work on better energy efficiency. In a sense, the 1970s oil shock paved
the way for the Japanese auto industry to win over international markets in the 1980s,
thanks to its cutting-edge fuel efficiency.


Eternal sunshine of the MITI mind
One major solar initiative to emerge from the 1970s oil crisis was the Sunshine Project
launched in late 1974 at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and
Technology under the auspices of METI’s predecessor, MITI (Ministry of International
Trade and Industry). This national program sought to develop alternative energy such
as solar, geothermal, and hydrogen.

Results came quickly. Anyone old enough to remember can’t forget the feeling of awe
when, in 1976, Sharp unveiled the world’s first electronic calculator fully powered by
solar energy.

After some time, however, as oil prices stabilized, the impetus to develop solar
plateaued. At the Sunshine Project, there were plans to develop solar equipment
affordable for households within 20 years. Finally, it was achieved but the idea never
translated into commercial reality.

In 1993, after 20 years, the first solar equipment for households reached the market.
The price was ¥15 million for a 4 kW system, far from affordable. However,
undeterred, MITI then embarked on a "New Sunshine Program".

By 2000, Japanese PV manufacturers led the nascent global solar market. In 2005,
Japan produced almost half (48.2%) of the world's solar panels. Among the world's
top five solar panel producers, four were Japanese, according to Renewable Energy
World.

1. Sharp (428 MW)
2. Q-Cells (166 MW)
3. Kyocera (142 MW)
4. Sanyo (125 MW)
5. Mitsubishi Electric (100 MW)


China pushes aside Japan’s dominance
Years of Japanese dominance came to an end by the end of the 2000s, first slowly
and then at a rapid pace thanks to the accelerating pace of development by suppliers
in other countries. None were more active than the Chinese manufacturers, using
state support to leap from big local players to global majors. Today, firms like Jinko
Solar, JA Solar, Trina Solar and LONGi Solar control most of the Japanese solar PV
market.

21

Chinese firms enjoy lower labor costs than Japanese peers, but they also leveraged
the power of government-affiliated financial institutions such as China Development
Bank to surge ahead. The bank backed the construction of both manufacturing
facilities and mega solar projects across the globe.

Such a public-private partnership helped China surge ahead to develop both the most
cost-competitive and technically proficient solar equipment on the market, making the
country a vital part of the global PV supply chain.

After more than a decade of mourning the loss of their market share, Japanese
companies seem finally ready to offer a new competitive proposition for the solar
industry. They believe that the sector is ready for a technological shift to PSC, a
radically different and innovative product, in which Japan’s makers currently have an
edge. And this time, support from the government in Tokyo will be a crucial factor in
the strategy.

Japan’s New Emissions Trading System:
Aiming High, but Going Slow
Japan has finally launched its long-awaited CO2 emissions trading system (ETS). After
an earlier five-month trial, last week the system began full-fledged operations on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Initially, carbon trading will be conducted on a voluntary basis. The ETS will run in
‘phase-one’ mode for the next three years for companies that signed up. The
government has dubbed the early adopters as the GX League, and entry to this club
is open until April 28.

The last two governments ranked carbon trading as a priority for Japan to meet
emission reduction targets, and Prime Minister Kishida has brought it to fruition. His
clean energy strategy, called the Green Transformation (GX), sees the ETS as the basis
for a range of other initiatives in carbon capture, hydrogen, synthetic fuels, and
energy efficiency, etc. It’s even seen as a platform to help develop renewables and
revive the nuclear sector.

Last week, the House of Representatives approved the GX League bill to push the
world’s No. 5 polluter closer to counting its emission costs. But while Kishida promises
to use GX to attract ¥150 trillion of investments into decarbonization efforts, how
much of a role will the CO2 trading mechanism actually play?


Past trials and future roadmap
Last year, a group of more than 400 companies and other entities signed up to the GX
League. These pioneers spent several months debating what a nationwide carbon
trading market should look like. While many of the bigger issues remained
outstanding, it was decided to move to a test phase of actual trading of contracts on
an exchange.

From September 2022 to January 2023, the Tokyo Stock Exchange ran a trial on a
new platform set up for carbon credits. The main goals were to check what liquidity
the market could attract and ensure that exchange prices could work based on market
signals. For the sake of simplicity and uniformity, the trading was in J-Credits, a
domestic CO2 credits program set up a decade ago.

Over those five months, J-Credits equivalent to 150,000 tons of CO2 were traded.
There were 163 transactions between 183 participants. The number of offers (220) was
notably lower than the volume of bids (342).

GX ETS Trial Data (Sept 2022-Jan. 2023)
J-Credit type Trading volume in CO2 ton equivalent Average transacted price/ ton of CO2
Energy conservation     73,619               ¥1431

Renewables            75,255               ¥2953

Forestry              59                 ¥14,571

| Japan’s New Emissions Trading System: |
| --- |
| Aiming High, but Going Slow |

| J-Credit type | Trading volume in CO2 ton equivalent | Average transacted price/ ton of CO2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy conservation | 73,619 | ¥1431 |
| Renewables | 75,255 | ¥2953 |
| Forestry | 59 | ¥14,571 |

This trial wasn’t the first time that Japan embarked on efforts to build an ETS. Local
cap and trade systems have been in place in Tokyo and Saitama since 2010 and 2011,
respectively. Yet, these were limited to their regions, with the credits negotiated on a
bilateral basis or sold via a basic auction, rather than offered on an exchange. Such
factors made it difficult to establish a universal market price.


Market rules
The first three years of credits trading will be used to build a fair and effective overall
framework, as well as to collect data from the companies involved. Further
improvements will follow in FY2026.

Then, the platform is expected to move to the next stage once Japan introduces a
carbon levy from FY2028. Initially, the levy will be limited to the heavy polluter,
broadening to include power producers only in 2033. Until that time, carbon credit
trading will remain on a voluntary basis.

Still, even with a voluntary approach, a company interested in participating has to
fulfill certain criteria. For example, participants must send data to the GX League
about their emissions reduction, and set annual emission targets for FY2025 and
FY2030. The baseline for company targets will be FY2013.

The GX League will divide participating companies into two groups, those that
emitted more than 100,000 tons of CO2e in FY2021 (Group G), and those who
emitted less than that in the same period (Group X).


Failures and Options
Companies that don’t meet GHG emission targets must abide by an “explain or
comply’’ principle. They’ll have to buy eligible carbon credits or explain the reasons
for failing to reach targets. For the first three-year period of trading, all participating
companies will need to have an emissions target, but only Scope 1 emissions will be
traded in the ETS.

Companies that manage to cut their CO2 equivalent at a faster rate than Japan’s
national goal (as defined in the NDC sent to the United Nations) will also be eligible
to receive additional credits. Japan’s NDC targets a 46% emission reduction by 2030,
compared to 2013; that assumes a drop of 27.0% by FY2023; 29.7% by FY2024; and
32.4% by FY2025.

The credits themselves will mainly come from Japan’s domestic programs, the J-
Credit and the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). However, this year, the GX League
plans to establish a working group that will consider eligibility of other types of carbon
credits.

What this means is, credits that reflect efforts toward the removal / capture of carbon
may also be eligible, in addition to credits coined from reducing emissions. This
opens the door to the trading of J-Blue credits (which certify CO2 that’s absorbed by
marine and coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass) and others.




24


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Carbon credits that reflect the reduction of global emissions, however, would be
ineligible for the Japanese platform. To trade in Tokyo, the credit needs to be based
on a change in emissions affecting Japan.


Doubts and uncertainty
Many questions remain around Japan’s ETS, which is lagging similar developments in
other major Asian economies. China and South Korea already have carbon trading
schemes. Europe, which has one of the world’s largest ETS platforms, will also
introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) this fall. In that respect,
Japan’s goal of fully embedding the ETS into its economy by 2033 seems too distant.

On the corporate side, many worry about limited trading volumes, claiming that JCM
and J-Credits programs alone will be insufficient to supply the market. Therefore, the
business world is calling to allow the use of foreign credits. But the government looks
resolute in focusing on Japan’s emissions only (and, thus, limiting the outflow of
money overseas).

The number of participating companies may also be a problem. Currently, GX League
counts around 700 members, but it’s not clear how many of them will actually join in
the trading and do so at a substantial level. The GX number also looks small when
compared to countries like Thailand, whose ETS has attracted 12,000 firms.

Businesses that endorse the GX League are said to account for 40% of Japan’s total
emissions. Yet, participation in the ETS will probably be much smaller.
















How to benefit?
Some critics believe that too much focus on trading will do little to address
decarbonization itself and call for the ETS to play only a side role in Japan’s net-zero
strategy.

Historically, trading has also been a minor part of Japan’s business and market
environment outside of a few energy commodities with the number of specialist
traders in the country low. It’s notable that when Tokyo City introduced its local cap-
and trade system, only 15% of the participants went on to participate in emission
trading during 2015-2019. Most managed to reach reduction targets through other
means, such as energy conservation.

25


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

What will stimulate companies outside the initial GX League list to embrace change is
not clear. Japan’s carbon levy and trading roadmap is less aggressive than in other
countries. The government hopes that a voluntary approach will foster a culture of
climate accountability without coming across like a climate tax. Such an approach has
worked well with corporate governance reform in the country.

However, with the pace of change abroad much faster, Japanese firms with
international exposure will struggle to remain competitive if they are seen to dither at
home. There’s a risk also that international rules will be indirectly imposed on Japan
by first-movers elsewhere.

PM Kishida’s government will need to demonstrate to companies at home how this
voluntary market will benefit them while contributing to the lowering of Japan’s
emissions as a whole. Officials will have much less than their roadmap suggests to
make that happen.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ Energy deals
France and China signed nuclear and wind energy deals during Macron’s visit to
China. French state utility EDF and Chinese utility CGN, both major NPP operators,
renewed their long-standing partnership. Deals were also signed between EDF and
China Energy Investment Corp for offshore wind.

Europe/ Oil imports
The EU is benefiting from India’s record high imports of Russian crude oil, boosting
diesel and jet fuel exports to the EU which has banned Russian products. Access to
cheap Russian crude has boosted output and profits at Indian refineries, enabling
them to export refined products competitively to the EU and take bigger market
share.

France/ Nuclear power
The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is investigating a deal by French power
operator EDF to buy a nuclear turbine maker from General Electric. EDF agreed to
buy GE’s nuclear components business in February; the acquisition was hailed as a
way of securing French control of turbine technology as EDF plans to build new
reactors.

Germany/ Clean energy infrastructure
From 2026 to 2030, the deep water port of Wilhelmshaven will spend €5 billion to
build clean energy infrastructure needed for hydrogen and ammonia imports,
hydrogen production and offshore carbon storage. Energy Hub Port Wilhelmshaven
comprises 30 companies, which include Wintershall Dea, Uniper , E.ON, and RWE.

India/ Renewable energy
By March 2028, India will issue tenders for 250 GW of green energy capacity, looking
to cut national emissions 45% from 2005 levels. After missing a target to build 175
GW in renewables capacity by 2022, India seeks to boost non-fossil capacity to 500
GW by 2030.

India/ Electricity
Last fiscal year, National power generation grew at the fastest pace in over three
decades, reported Reuters. This has fueled a major surge in GHG emissions as output
from both coal-fired and renewable plants hit record highs.

Iraq/ Oil deal
Baghdad agreed to a smaller 30% stake in TotalEnergies long-delayed $27 billion
project, reviving a deal that could lure back foreign investment. Signed in 2021, the
deal called for TotalEnergies to build four oil, gas and renewables projects with an
initial investment of $10 billion in southern Iraq over 25 years.



27

Mexico/ Electricity
The government will buy 13 power plants from Spanish energy giant Iberdrola in a $6
billion deal to be completed within five months. Mexico's president hailed it as a "new
nationalization" of the electricity market that will strengthen state control.

Russia/ Oil deals
Russia is making ship-to-ship transfers of diesel near African ports, with an eye to
transatlantic sales. For example, as a result of the EU ban on Russian fuel that started
Feb. 5, tankers carrying oil products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and naphtha
travel up to 18 days to bring Russian supplies to Brazil. The result is more GHG
emissions from ships.

Venezuela/ Oil exports
Oil exports rose to the highest monthly average since August, boosted by resumption
of loadings after an export freeze and by more cargoes assigned to Chevron. State oil
company PDVSA reinstated two export contracts: a medium-term contract with
Hangzhou Energy, and another with Portugal’s Adinius Sociedade de Servicios.
