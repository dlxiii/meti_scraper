NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Generators unhappy as Okayama poised to impose Japan’s first solar tax
(Japan NRG, April 20)
•  In December, the city of Mimasaka passed a bylaw that seeks to tax commercial solar farm
operators a rate of ¥50/ m2 of installed PV panels.
•  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is reviewing the new scheme.
•  Mimasaka authorities hope for federal government approval by the end of this year.
•  The solar industry association, ASPEn, is opposing the new tax, saying this bylaw will make it

harder for generators to stay in business.
•  According to ASPEn, solar generators make a profit of around ¥1/ kWh, while the new tax will cost
around ¥0.3/ kWh.
• TAKEAWAY: This is a momentous case that could change the economics of solar and other renewables in
Japan. The topic was covered in detail in the Japan NRG webinar in January 2022, the recording of which and
its presentations are available on the website.

• The Mimasaka decision will complicate tax calculations around solar as tax incentives were introduced at the
national level to propel an expansion of renewable energy capacity. Solar panels are subject to property tax,
which is a local tax. In the first three years of service, solar, geothermal, biomass, wind and hydro power

operators nationwide are eligible for 25-30% cuts in property tax over 2022-2023.


Four ministries join to tackle renewable and community conflicts

(Japan NRG, April 21)
•  METI, the MoE, Agriculture Ministry (MAFF) and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism (MLIT) launched a joint panel to resolve increasing conflicts between renewable operators
and communities. 850 complaints against renewable operators were filed to METI from October
2016 to February 2022, and 10% of municipalities legislated ordinances that limit renewable
installations. The panel will work with the ministries that have oversight on laws applicable to
renewable projects.

•  The 14-member panel is chaired by Yamaji Kenji, president of Research Institute of Innovative
Technology for the Earth (RITE). Members include Takamura Yukari, Tokyo University professor
who presently chairs the METI Power Tariff Committee, Amamiya Toshihiko, official of Yamanashi
Prefecture that launched the country’s first power to gas project using solar power, and Yunoki
Shigeo, an agricultural policy expert.
•  At the inaugural meeting, METI described the conflicts in three project phases, followed by other

ministries describing some regulations under their oversight that affect renewables. While clean
energy is encouraged, renewable operators do not have easy access to project sites due to
housing, safety, nature conservation and farmland regulations, MoE, MAFF and MLIT officials told
the panel.

• TAKEAWAY: While the panel’s stated role is to improve communications between operators and communities,
the inaugural discussion touched on sensitive intra-ministry issues such as energy vs food security. Productive
farmland needs to be protected from renewable projects since it takes a long time to convert land used for
non-farm purposes to grow crops, a MAFF official stressed. A MLIT official said a blanket national regulation
that restricts soil mounds, regardless of purpose, is needed to prevent landslides. The MoE cited an example
of a renewable project that both MoE and METI disqualified based on the conclusion that it would cause more
environmental harm than benefit.

METI puts emphasis on hydrogen in R&D for next-gen nuclear technology

(Nikkei Shimbun, April 20)
•  METI held its first expert meeting on next-generation nuclear power plants, and plans to
emphasize on technology that can produce hydrogen from nuclear heat. The expert group will also
explore new ways to use hydrogen.
•  CONTEXT: The group sits under the nuclear energy Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for
Natural Resources and Energy (an advisory body to METI).
•  The committee aims to formulate a development timetable for nuclear tech and will set out its
direction by the summer. Its recommendations will also be reflected in the next Clean Energy

Strategy that PM Kishida plans to unveil in the summer.
•  Next-gen nuclear tech under consideration are: high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs),
small modular reactors (SMRs), fast reactors, and reactors with enhanced safety features.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s existing HTGR program is able to produce heat of 950°C Celsius, which is
enough to allow for manufacture of hydrogen in large amounts.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Mitsubishi Heavy plans to build micro nuclear reactors that can fit on a truck
(Asia Nikkei, April 19)
o  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries plans to develop and commercialize in the 2030s nuclear
reactors that are small enough to be delivered on a truck.
o  The microreactors, with a maximum output of 500 kW, will be three meters tall and four
meters wide, and weigh less than 40 tons. This means both the reactor and power
generating equipment will fit inside a container truck, enabling it to be delivered to

remote or disaster-hit areas.
o  The tech will be small enough to be buried underground, mitigating the risk of an
accident, according to MHI. The technology could also be used in space exploration.

METI announces cost estimates for hydrogen storage and supply infrastructure
(Japan NRG, April 18)
•  In a bid to identify areas of support for quick and efficient build-up of zero carbon energy systems,
METI revealed rough cost estimates of hydrogen storage and supply infrastructure components for

different carrier technologies. The base assumptions are that the pipelines will be used for 40
years, tanks will store 20 consumption days-equivalent molecules, and tank trunks redemption
matures in 12 years.
•  During a METI meeting, a Tokyo gas official advised it was difficult to forecast which technology
will provide breakthrough solutions. Also, when assessing technologies, new ones tend to attract
more attention and there’s a risk of overlooking the benefits of upgrading legacy technologies.

Cost estimate table

Liquid hydrogen MCH           Ammonia
Pipelines at supply terminals ¥145 million/km ¥278 million/km ¥66 million/km

¥38.4 billion for storing ¥4.2 billion for 61,600 ¥11.6 billion for 56,700
Tank
36,000 tons of H2 tons of toluene tons of ammonia
High pressure pipeline ¥60 million ¥120 million ¥30 million
Low pressure pipeline ¥36 million --            --
Tank truck        ¥20 million    ¥20 million    ¥20 million

• TAKEAWAY: METI recognizes that the government’s role in growing the new industry is challenging since it
can’t please every player. It is weighing two options: to support a select few players at a risk of limiting
hydrogen’s market potential, or to reach out to a wide range of players, which may result in complicated
programs.



Green Innovation Fund picks 14 battery R&D projects
(NEDO Statement, April 19)
•  The Green Innovation Fund selected 14 battery research and development projects subject to fund
total grants of ¥120.5 billion from 2022 to 2030. The key objectives are to develop enhanced
batteries, battery materials and recycling technologies.
• TAKEAWAY: The 10 battery projects are equally split between two competing technologies — solid-state

batteries and next-generation lithium-ion batteries.
• While Tesla just released the model Y mounted with Panasonic’s advanced “4680” lithium-ion batteries,
Japanese automakers are betting on solid state batteries. Among the solid-battery adapters, Toyota Motor

paces ahead by launching a test drive of an all-solid-state battery vehicle in 2020 and plans to commercialize it
by 2025. Nissan Motor eyes its vehicle launch by 2028, and Honda by 2030.

Safety and cost are challenges for moving liquefied CO2 at sea: Mitsubishi Heavy
(Japan NRG, April 18)
•  CONTEXT: Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Corporation said on April 18 that it has completed a concept
study for a ship that will be capable of transporting both ammonia and liquefied CO2 (LCO2). The
study was conducted in cooperation with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), based on a ship type that
could become mainstream in the LCO2 ship market.
•  Safety management and lower cost of transport will be the technology challenges to

commercialize liquefied CO2 transport by sea, a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries spokesman told Japan
NRG. Together with Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, the company has completed a concept study of
vessels to transport ammonia one way and liquefied carbon on a return trip, to avoid empty ship
travels.















Source: MHI

•  MHI also told Japan NRG that current port facilities can be used to load and offload ammonia and
liquefied carbon, but new facilities need to be built to accommodate much larger shipments. This
carbon transport technology will likely be established by 2030 as the government targets the start
of CCUS by then.
• TAKEAWAY: The liquefied CO2 transport market is heating up. Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and Mitsubishi

Shipbuilding completed a similar study last month. MOL invested into Norway’s Larvik Shipping that has
experience in liquefied CO2 transport. In January, NYK established Knutsen NYK Carbon Carriers with
Norway’s Knutsen.

(Company Statement, April 19)
•  Kansai Electric and INPEX signed an MOU to collaborate in the areas of zero-carbon fuels such as

hydrogen and ammonia, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The two companies will start with
a desk study to determine what kind of projects they can cooperate on.


Under growing regulatory pressure from EU, Asahi Kasei to disclose emissions
(Asia Nikkei, April 19)
•  Chemical maker Asahi Kasei will disclose CO2 emissions from procurement and production of

about half of its resin products to customers starting in May. The company is acting amid growing
regulatory pressure from the EU.
•  CONTEXT: The EU plans to ban imports of batteries and other products for electric vehicles with
excessive emissions from 2027.
•  Asahi Kasei will calculate the emissions of the entire production process, including not only its own
processes but also those of its contractors that process chemical raw materials. The disclosure will

cover 10,000 resin products used in cars and home appliances.



METI compiles overview of new CCS legislation
(Japan NRG, April 20)
•  METI compiled a preliminary overview of new legislation required for CCS projects. They’ll need to
cover definitions of the rights over underground spaces, both offshore and onshore and the

responsibilities of CCS operators. The laws also need to clarify state oversight over offshore
exclusive economic zones, and establish a regulatory framework to allow carbon exports for
storage overseas.


Hiroshima’s 10-year carbon capture trial nears completion

(Nikkei, April 19)
•  Osaki Coolgen reached the final stage in a multi-stage trial in Hiroshima Prefecture that promises
to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from coal-fired plants.
•  Researchers experimented with technology for combusting coal in a gasification furnace together
with oxygen and steam. The CO2 produced is isolated and stored, while the hydrogen yielded is
used to power a gas turbine and a steam turbine.
•  The final phase, which kicked off on April 18, will add two 600 kW fuel cells to the system, allowing
some of the hydrogen gas to be converted into electricity.

•  CONTEXT: The latest coal-fired generation technology allows for about 40% energy efficiency.
This experimental system promises to bump that number to 47% while also recovering 90% of
CO2 emissions.
•  The trial, which began in 2012, is performed in conjunction with the government-backed national
R&D hub NEDO. Osaki Coolgen is a JV between Chugoku Electric and J-Power.

Osaka Gas to build test facility for methanation, move to commercialization
(Nikkei, April 19)
•  Osaka Gas will build a test facility for methanation at its R&D headquarters in Osaka City. The
utility will use proprietary technology to make methane, a raw material for city gas, more efficiently.

•  The first test phase will see output at levels that are enough to supply just 200 households, but this
will be expanded to 10,000 households by FY2030. The company aims to cut costs and
commercialize the technology around 2040.
•  The ¥25 billion test facility will receive state assistance and be managed together with the National
Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).
•  CONTEXT: Methanation is considered to be a clean energy solution for natural gas in heating.

Osaka Gas’ technology uses waste heat generated during the production of methane to make
hydrogen.


METI boosts support for green initiatives in materials sector
(Nikkei, April 17)
•  METI announced its vision for the materials sector, which needs over ¥20 trillion to finance green

technology to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050.
•  CONTEXT: The materials sector is responsible for 80% of Japan’s total industrial emissions.
•  The government will fund R&D, as well as plant upgrades.
•  The government must also reduce electricity tariffs paid by industrial subscribers, and assist the
private sector to establish hydrogen production infrastructure and implement CCUS initiatives.
•  Particularly carbon-intensive are the steel and chemical industries, which together are responsible
for over half of Japan’s total industrial emissions.



METI, MLIT to co-launch government- private sector SAF council
(Japan NRG, April 22)
•  METI and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism will jointly establish a new
government-private sector consultation body for sustainable aviation fuel.




Mitsubishi Corp and ENEOS to mass-produce cleaner jet fuel
(Nikkei Shimbun, April 18)
•  Trading house Mitsubishi Corp. and oil refinery major ENEOS plan to produce sustainable aviation
fuel (SAF) as soon as 2027. The two will establish a domestic supply chain that will span everything
from procurement of raw materials to large-scale manufacture of the bio jet fuel and its

distribution.
•  CONTEXT: SAF is derived from biomass, such as used cooking oil and plants. It is mixed with jet
fuel derived from crude oil. Using it, CO2 emissions from aircraft can be reduced by 70% to 90%
compared to conventional fuel.
•  The two companies currently import SAF but see demand picking up in Japan due to stringent
decarbonization regulations in global aviation. Mitsubishi owns grain and chemicals businesses,
which will help it with procurement of raw materials.

J-Power among Japanese firms buying carbon credits based on marine work
(Asia Nikkei, April 22)
•  An increasing number of companies are interested in the ability of algae and other marine plants
to capture the perilous emissions released into the atmosphere.

•  J-Power utility has begun using carbon credits gained by raising algae in the sea near its facility in
Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture, in the southwest of Japan.
•  This so-called “blue carbon” could become a key weapon in the fight against global warming.
According to one estimate, coastal ecosystems might have the same or even higher carbon
absorption power as forests.
•  J-Power recently used 16 tons worth of carbon credits it gained by nurturing a sea grass bed -- the

company's first blue carbon program -- near the Kitakyushu plant. J-Power will not sell the credits
but use them to offset its own CO2 emissions.


Mitsubishi to invest $100 million in Bill Gates’ clean tech program

(Nikkei Asia, April 22)
•  Mitsubishi Corp. will contribute $100 million to a program supported by Bill Gates that aims to
accelerate the deployment of clean energy innovations like hydrogen that are close to ready for
market.
•  The trading house will be the first core Asian partner in the Breakthrough Energy Catalyst program.




Japan firm succeeds in world's first production of float glass using 100% biofuel
(Kankyo Business, April 18)
•  Nippon Sheet Glass succeeded in the world's first test of float glass production using 100% biofuel

at the Greengate site (St. Helens, UK) of Pilkington UK.
•  The experiment was part of an initiative to study the introduction of sustainable, low-carbon fuels
to replace natural gas, currently the primary fuel source. The company has confirmed an 80%
reduction in CO2 emissions from the new process.



Indonesia the latest country to embrace resource nationalism

(Nikkei, April 16)
•  A global surge in resource nationalism is stoking fears over supply.
•  Indonesia, which supplies 30% of global nickel demand and 7% of global coal demand, has
recently imposed restrictions on export of these commodities.
•  By requiring exporters to add value to nickel and coal exports, the new law aims to encourage
investment in local value-added processing facilities.
•  Indonesia is the latest in a series of countries to impose controls on exports of resources: Chile,

Peru, Mexico, Congo and Mongolia hold significant reserves of copper, gold and cobalt, and all
implemented similar legislation.
•  Similar rises in resource nationalism came during the 1970s oil shock and in the early 2000s.

Three million switch to Tokyo Gas amid electricity market chaos
(Nikkei, April 21)
•  Tokyo Gas is on track to sign over 3 million new electricity subscribers in April, after a raft of energy
start-ups went out of business, leaving customers stranded.
•  More subscribers switched to larger providers, fearing theirs “could be next”.
•  Tokyo Gas owns several power stations, and can undercut small energy companies.
•  Meanwhile, No.1 mobile phone operator NTT DoCoMo, which launched its electricity retail service

in March, received over 100,000 applications in its first month of operation.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Commercial subscribers flock to energy safety net
(San-in Chuo Shimpo, April 22)
o  METI said that over 4,000 commercial electricity subscribers had so far signed up for a
government scheme to guarantee businesses service in the event that they’re unable to

find a new power provider.
o  To allay fears that the safety net will jeopardize competition or become permanent, METI
made changes so that tariffs paid by subscribers better reflect market rates.
• TAKEAWAY: Due to high price volatility, a number of smaller electricity retailers have exited the market, some
due to bankruptcy, in the last month or so. The situation is exacerbated further by a shortage of power
capacity in key urban hubs, which means the big generation companies seek to retain as much of their output

as they can for direct sales, rather than putting it up for sale on the wholesale exchange.


Half of major power utilities, all gas utilities to raise prices in June

(Mainichi Shimbun, April 21)
•  Five of the ten major power companies are expected to raise electricity rates for households in
June due to soaring import prices of crude oil, LNG, and other commodities.
•  The other five companies have already reached the upper limit under the fuel cost adjustment
system, which allows them to pass on higher fuel prices, and will need to leave their prices
unchanged.
•  All four major city gas companies are expected to raise their prices.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Power market oversight body to review fuel adjustment tariff due to high prices
(Gas Energy News, April 18)
o  The Electricity and Gas Basic Policy Subcommittee of the Agency for Natural Resources
and Energy is considering a review of the raw fuel cost adjustment system for gas and
electricity rates against the backdrop of soaring prices of LNG and other raw fuels.

o  Some believe that it would be desirable to eliminate the caps on adjustments, but the
Energy Agency is cautious because this would lead to an increase in the burden on
consumers.

As Wind Turbines Gain in Height and Power,
Sustainability Questions Also Arise

The expansion of large-scale wind farms, especially those built off the coast, is further
raising hopes that the energy transition can succeed within the next few decades. As
equipment becomes larger with more technological advances, the wind power
industry is increasingly under pressure to integrate into the circular economy and
minimize its environmental impact.

The issue of what to do with old wind equipment is a global challenge and must be
confronted now just as the wind power sector is poised to boom. But first, the industry
must find a solution for those wind power units that’ll soon face their expiration date.
The Global Wind Energy Council says that by 2030 nearly 200 GW of onshore wind
projects, mainly in the EU and the U.S., will conclude their operational lifespan.

Currently, there’s not much discussion in Japan about what to do with aging wind
turbines, primarily because Japan’s wind capacity – 4.5 GW as of March 2021 –
accounts for less than 1% of the national power mix. By comparison, solar has 62 GW
of capacity.

Nevertheless, these sustainability questions will be a major issue as Japan pushes to
make offshore wind power a key part of decarbonizing the country’s industry. By
2030, the government plans to increase wind capacity more than five-fold to 23.6 GW,
or 5% of the total generation, according to the Sixth Basic Energy Plan.

Upward and onward
Wind power presents different types of recycling challenges to solar. While solar
doesn’t have much variation in the size of PV panels, with wind, turbine sizes vary
greatly and they have been growing larger. For land-based turbines the hub height
(distance from the ground to the rotor’s middle) has increased nearly 60% since 1999,
to about 90 meters in 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

The average hub height for offshore wind turbines in the U.S. is projected to increase
from 100 meters in 2016 to 150 meters in 2035. Larger turbines mean more electricity,
but also larger and heavier components.

GE’s Haliade-X 14-MW prototype turbine, which started generating power in October
2021, has a tip height of 260 meters with 107-meter-long blades. Vestas plans to
install its 15-MW offshore prototype turbine later this year, which will be 20 meters
taller than GE’s largest turbine.

Once wind farms reach the end of normal operational life, typically after 20 years,
there are three options:
•  lifetime extension
•  decommissioning
•  repowering (replacing old turbines with more powerful and efficient models).

About 90% of wind turbine material can be recycled because the foundation,
components of the nacelle and the tower are made with materials such as steel,
reinforced cement, copper wire and electronics with established recycling
technologies. The problem is that the remaining 10% — turbine blades made with
composite materials — are difficult to recycle and often end up in landfills.

Some European countries have introduced landfill disposal bans on fiber-reinforced
composite, as well as requirements for the recyclability of the entire turbine, including
the blades. Last year, WindEurope, a wind energy industry group, called for a landfill
ban on decommissioned wind turbine blades by 2025.

Wind turbine blades are made of:
1) Reinforced fiber (glass, carbon, aramid or basalt)
2) Polymer matrix (thermosets such as epoxies, polyesters, vinyl esters, or
thermoplastics)
3) Sandwich core (balsa wood or foams such as polyvinyl PVC, PET)
4) Coatings (PE, PUR)
5) Metal (copper wiring, steel bolts, etc.).

“The main challenge is not a lack of blade recycling technology, but the economics
and scalability of the required composite recycling technologies,” said GWEC in a
recent annual report. “These are not yet commercially viable to factor into project
lifetime and decommissioning costs – especially as the industry faces increased
pricing pressures, both from downward pressure in markets and from sharp increases
in raw material and logistics costs.”

According to Wind Europe, composite materials used in blades boost the
performance of wind energy by allowing lighter and longer blades. About 2.5 million
tons of composite materials are in use in the wind industry globally. They are recycled
through the process called cement co-processing, which replaces cement raw
materials with the composite’s glass fibers and fillers. This process can reduce CO2
emissions in cement manufacturing by 16% if composites represent 75% of cement
raw materials.

In September 2021, Siemens Gamesa announced the world’s first recyclable turbine
blades ready for commercial use in offshore wind farms. The company has reached
agreements to install the recyclable turbines for current and future projects with three
of its major customers: RWE, EDF Renewables and wdp. The first six - each 81 meters
long - were produced in Denmark.

The company says its new resin’s chemical structure can efficiently separate it from
other materials. The blade can be immersed in a heated mild acidic solution to
separate the resin from the fiberglass, plastic, wood and metals. The materials can
then be reused in new applications such as in the auto industry or in consumer goods
like suitcases and flat screen casings.


Industry-wide initiatives
The initiative, Circular Economy for Thermosets Epoxy Composites (CETEC), is led by
Danish wind turbine maker Vestas, which aims to produce zero-waste turbines by
2040. This coalition is comprised of Vestas, Olin, Danish Technological Institute, and
Aarhus University. In 2021, it announced the development of a new resin technology.

In a two-step process, thermoset composites are disassembled into fiber and epoxy,
and the epoxy is further broken up into base components similar to virgin materials.
Vestas says these materials can be reintroduced into the manufacturing of new turbine
blades.

Vestas is also participating in the three-year DecomBlades project established in 2021
with 10 partners, including turbine makers Siemens Gamesa, LM Wind Power (GE
subsidiary), and wind power developer Ørsted. The goal is to commercialize the value
chain for turbine recycling: Blade manufacturers provide materials to the recycling
partners which process and test the materials.

Zero wastE Blade ReseArch (ZEBRA) is a consortium launched in 2020 and led by
French research center IRT Jules Verne. Members include Arkema, CANOE, Engie, LM
Wind Power, Owens Corning and SUEZ. In March, the first prototype of its 100%
recyclable turbine blade was completed and LM Wind Power will start full-scale
structural lifetime testing at its center in Denmark.

While the recycling of wind turbine blades is important in making the industry more
circular, another area of focus gaining importance is how to recover nonferrous metal
such as rare earth elements and copper in nacelles. The Japan Society of Newer
Metals set up a study group in November to promote the recovery of nonferrous
metal.

A 4.2-MW turbine by Vestas material breakdown is as follows, according to a company
brochure.

Decisions must be made today
Meanwhile, some companies are moving away from the use of traditional materials.
Take for example, Modvion, a Swedish company that counts Vestas among its
shareholders, and which is building wind turbines with wood, rather than steel. The
first tower - 30-meter-high – was delivered in 2020.

Modvion says its turbine is made with a laminated wood tower that’s stronger than
steel at the same weight. These turbines can be built in modules, which are easier to
transport and therefore, they can rise even higher than current towers.

While Europe is actively seeking solutions to these sustainability challenges, in Japan
there’s a serious lack of interest to discuss what to do with aging wind turbines. This
lack of concern is especially startling when compared to the greater willingness of
Japan’s solar industry to recycle solar panels.

This issue can only be muted for so long. The unavoidable fact is that thousands of
turbines which will be installed onshore and offshore in the coming years, and one day
they will all need to be retired. That might be in 2040 or in 2050, but the decisions
regarding sustainability need to be made today. The industry cannot afford to delay
these pertinent questions any longer.

Major Power Utilities Ally with Home Builders
Seeking Steady Profits from an Expected Boom in Rooftop Solar

Up until now, Japan’s major power utilities haven’t been big solar generation
enthusiasts, only building a tiny fraction of the country’s solar farms. However, the
companies are now taking a different position specifically on residential solar.

Since rooftop solar is a major component of government plans to boost Japan’s
renewable energy capacity, legacy regional power utilities are forming alliances with
local and large homebuilders and construction companies.

The goal is to expand the use of solar generation at the residential level and to make
rooftop solar an attractive proposition. The utilities are especially focusing on the “no-
upfront-costs” pricing plans.

As the government moves to make solar panels mandatory for new homes, while also
committing to installing the equipment on public buildings, solar capacity is poised
for renewed growth due to factors different than those which drove the sector to triple
in the past decade.

For the major electric power companies, the EPCos, this presents an attractive
opportunity to lock in consumers to multi-decade plans, while also guaranteeing
steady returns.


Central Japan
Chubu Electric Power Miraize, a unit of Chubu Electric group, now offers "Kanaeru
Solar," a solar power generation and self-consumption service for buyers of new
homes built by Ichijo Corporation. This reduces the initial cost of installing a large-
capacity solar generation system and storage batteries. The service has rolled out
across the country and will soon expand to Hokuriku and Shikoku, making Okinawa
the only exception.

Under this service, Chubu Electric will pay the initial installation costs of PV and
storage systems. The house buyer then pays a monthly service fee based on the
consumption of electricity generated by the home system, while also transferring any
surplus power to Chubu Electric. The utility is then free to sell the electricity under the
Feed-In Tariff (FIT) system. The contract term is 15 years.

Another selling point is that in the event of a power outage due to a natural disaster,
the home system should be able to maintain electricity supply thanks to installed
storage batteries.

Chubu Electric estimates that over the contract period consumers will face expenses
that are at least the same as if the solar PV and batteries were not installed. In some
cases, the households may even see an annual savings of about ¥9,300.

This estimate is based on a model all-electric household in Nagoya City, with annual
electricity consumption of 6,829 kWh, solar panel output of 10.0 kW, annual electricity
generation of 12,938 kWh, and storage batteries that charge from surplus electricity
generated by the panels and discharge it at night. The electricity rates are based on
Chubu Electric's "Smart Life Plan”, with a contracted capacity of 10kVA.

Northeast Japan
Hokuriku Electric signed a new business alliance agreement with at least five house-
builders in the Hokuriku area to provide a service called "Easy Solar with House-
builders", which is aimed at newly built detached houses. This also offers a fixed
monthly fee plan after an initial outlay of zero yen for the homeowner.

Households that build or purchase a new detached house from a builder affiliated with
Hokuriku Electric will be able to use solar electricity without incurring the initial cost of
installing panels. The service period is set at 10 years, with ownership of the
generation equipment due to transfer to the household free of charge after that.

The utility has made this service available for vertical metal roofs, horizontal metal
roofs, and tiled roofs; it applies to all of its service area, including regions with heavy
snowfall; and it can be applied to a range of panel capacities, from 4kW to 6kW.

What’s more, Tohoku Electric Power Solar e-Charge, a subsidiary of the utility, signed
a similar business partnership agreement with five housing construction companies in
Sado City, Niigata Prefecture. The partners will offer a third-party solar and storage
battery service for residential customers that buy a newly built home on Sado Island,
making it the prefecture’s first island to offer such a service.

Northern Isle of Hokkaido
A similar service to those mentioned above was launched by Hokkaido Electric under
the name "Flat Solar." It also allows new detached houses to have solar generation
equipment installed at no initial cost, with homeowners paying a fixed monthly fee.

Hokkaido Electric has agreements with Japan House Holdings and Universal Home.
The number of partners is set to grow as home systems with batteries are seen to
provide more power supply security in areas with heavy snowfall, like Hokkaido,
Tohoku, and Hokuriku.


Tokyo area
TEPCO Energy Partners and Sumitomo Realty & Development agreed last year to
plan and implement projects that lead the way in decarbonization. Sumitomo will offer
the "Sumifu x Enekari" plan to buyers of its new detached houses. Residential PV
power generation equipment and storage batteries will be installed at zero initial cost.

The partners also provide support for repair and renewal of equipment and claim that
subscribers will receive income from the sale of their surplus electricity.

TEPCO is the first major infrastructure company that provides long-term support for
equipment maintenance and repairs. “Enekari” is an energy service provided by
TEPCO Home Tech, a group company of TEPCO Energy Partners. It allows customers
to use the latest energy-saving equipment for a fixed monthly fee, also with zero
upfront costs.


New profit models
For consumers, reducing another bulky price tag from a new home is attractive and
the potential energy security of the system makes for a good sell. But the utilities also
see this service as having multiple profit channels. In addition to selling surplus
electricity that the service users generate at a guaranteed FIT level, there’s also scope
to claim carbon credits.

TEPCO Energy Partners, for example, plans to calculate the “environmental value”
from all the homes that switch to renewables through its services, aggregate this, and
then apply for the J-Credit carbon crediting system operated by METI, MoE and the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

With the launch of Japan’s first ever national carbon credit exchange this April, which
is expected to allow for the trading of instruments including J-Credits, the utilities may
see another profit channel by helping new home owners go green.

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Green hydrogen
The Financial Times raised questions about the billions of dollars pledged to green
hydrogen energy projects in Australia. It ran the subtitle: “Vaunted $188bn pipeline of
projects is yet to translate to a single molecule being sold”, and added that investors
are sitting on “the sidelines waiting for a shift in policy from the fossil-fuel friendly
government.”

Brazil/ Solar and wind power
Enel plans to build as much as 3 GW of solar and wind generation power capacity. The
company already operates more than 4.7 GW of renewable power in Brazil, which
accounts for 40% of Enel’s growth in Latin America’s renewable market.

Canada/ Wind power
Boralex, Energir and Hydro-Quebec will join forces to develop three wind projects with
a total capacity of 1.2 GW. The partnership is part of Hydro-Quebec’s plans to develop
a portfolio of wind energy projects in the region.

India/ Renewable energy
Tata Power Co. said BlackRock Real Assets and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co.
will invest $525 million in its renewable energy unit for a 10.5% stake. Tata Power wants
to build a portfolio of over 20 GW of renewable capacity over the next five years, up
from today’s 4.9 GW.

Morocco/ Solar power
Morocco launched the first phase of Nor II, its 333 MW solar energy initiative that covers
14 projects stretching over seven locations. Thirteen of the 14 projects have already
been awarded to private companies.

Philippines/ Offshore wind
The country has the potential to install 21 GW of offshore wind power by 2040, about
a fifth of its electricity supply by then, according to the Department of Energy and the
World Bank. Fossil fuels now account for about 79% of the Philippines’ power
generation mix. Renewable energy only had a 21% share of the energy mix in 2020,
down from 34% in 2008.

Portugal/ Green hydrogen
Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners’ Energy Transition Fund (CIP) will team up with
Madoqua Renewables to create a €1 billion green hydrogen and ammonia plant.
The industrial-scale MadoquaPower2X project will use renewable energy and 500 MW
of electrolysis capacity.
