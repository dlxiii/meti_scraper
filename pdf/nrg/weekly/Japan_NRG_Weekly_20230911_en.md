NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Japan, UK energy ministers agree on CRM, nuclear and clean energy initiatives
(Govt statement, Sept 6)
•  Japanese and UK energy ministers plan to sign a MoU for Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) and
increase dialogue to enhance deployment of hydrogen, solar, offshore wind, nuclear, CCUS and
other clean energy. They also inked an agreement where state banks will support infrastructure
projects in third countries.
•  METI Minister Nishimura said there’s a need to establish a level playing field in CRM markets,

saying one country has become dominant due to state subsidies.
• TAKEAWAY: Recent multi-govt efforts to build a safeguard mechanism against CRM supply disruptions have
emphasized securing supplies. Any raw material strategy is a combination of supply as well as demand side
measures, which include seeking CRM substitutes, reducing usage, recycling and diversifying the material
processing chains. The development of cobalt-free batteries is one example of a demand side measure.
Relying heavily on supply side measures may result in supply chains that are too expensive to maintain.

• For a deeper dive into Japan’s recents moves in the CRM space, see this week’s Analysis section.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan-UK to cooperate on high-temperature gas reactor project
(Govt statement, Sept 6)
o  Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) and the UK National Nuclear Laboratory signed a
MoU on high-temperature gas reactor development.
o  They will collaborate in deploying the new reactors, as well as jointly develop nuclear

supply chains and train staff.
o  CONTEXT: The UK began the program for high-temperature gas reactor demos in
September 2022, and it plans to have a high-temperature gas reactor demo in operation
by the early 2030s. The UK chose high-temperature gas reactors because it has the
potential to substantially reduce GHGs reduction.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has been one of the leaders in this kind of reactor technology. Its HTTR reactor uses
helium to cool and graphite as a moderator. However, Japan’s R&D progress stalled for a decade after the

Fukushima disaster, potentially ceding technological advantage to China.




Japan and U.S. to deepen cooperation on CCUS
(Govt statement, Sept 6)
•  The Japan-U.S. CCUS working group agreed to deepen cooperation between state-ran initiatives

in this field – the U.S. National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) and Japan’s Osaki Kamijima carbon
recycling pilot project.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The working group consists of NEDO, the U.S. National Energy Technology
Laboratory, METI and the U.S. Dept of Energy. The goal is to expand CCUS technology globally
and to help the private sector ramp up its project scope.
• TAKEAWAY: By role-sharing the collaboration covers the entire CCUS chain from carbon capture to utilization.
Japan’s interest is in the Polaris membrane that filters carbon from other gasses; it’s believed to be the world’s

most advanced. At Osaki Kamijima’s laboratory, NEDO is developing synthetic fuels and plastics using
captured carbon. Meanwhile, NEDO will continue research on its membranes that have been in development
since 2011.



Govt eyes converting oil refineries into plastic recycling plants
(Japan NRG, Sept 6)
•  The govt is studying ways to convert oil refineries into plastic recycling facilities, said Prof. Yoshioka
Toshiaki of Tohoku University, speaking at the Japan Analytical and Scientific Instruments Show. He
advises Yokkaichi City, which plans to build a “carbon-neutral industrial complex” around a Cosmo
Oil refinery.
•  Distillation units, desulfurization and other equipment in oil refineries can be used to treat plastic

waste that can be gasified and turned into industrial alcohol, hydrogen, methanol, and other
chemical feeds.
•  Petrochemical plants are nearby and will collaborate.
•  CONTEXT: Last year, METI published its “carbon neutral industrial complex” concept, where oil
refineries and petrochemical and other heavy industry plants connect via pipelines to share

hydrogen and ammonia supplies. ENEOS said its refineries will be used to convert hydrogen
carrier methylcyclohexane back to hydrogen. While the METI concept included chemical recycling
of plastic wastes at the complexes, it did not elaborate on how the plastics would be recycled.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Interim plan announced for ENEOS Wakayama refinery site
(Wakayama Pref statement, Sept 5)
o  ENEOS, METI, and Wakayama Pref announced an interim plan for the ENEOS Wakayama

refinery site that ceases operation in October.
o  The goal is to turn the refinery site into a supply source for next-gen energy.
o  After the Wakayama oil refinery is closed, ENEOS plans to start producing 300,000 tons
(or 400 million liters) of SAF and commercialize production by 2026. In addition to SAF,
ENEOS plans to produce other forms of next-gen energy.



MoE likely to amend and write new laws on offshore wind for 2024 parliament

(Japan NRG, Sept 8)
•  The MoE is considering to amend the Environment Impact Assessment Act to change the
assessment process of offshore wind projects. Rather than project operators conducting the
assessment, the MoE is proposing that it will conduct the initial impact surveys before deciding
whether the area is fit for offshore projects.
•  METI and MLIT are to consult the MoE before selecting offshore project areas. Presently, METI and

MLIT make a final decision. Project operators will conduct separate assessments at later stages.
5



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The MoE also plans to write a new law on the assessments and monitoring of environmental
conditions in Exclusive Economic Zones. It will submit the law proposals to the Diet next year.
•  CONTEXT: On Aug 31, an MoE panel on offshore wind impact assessment published a
recommendation that included changes in how the assessment is done. While the proposed new
system will likely reduce operators’ time and costs, they’ll have less control of the process to

explore new areas for potential projects. Meanwhile, the idea of increasing the MoE’s oversight in
project development may gain traction depending on the outcome of the recent offshore wind
bribery scandal around lawmaker Akimoto. See the Power Markets section for more details.


METI requests PSC development budget increase to ¥64.8 billion

(Denki Shimbun, Sept 4)
•  METI plans to increase funding for the development of next-gen perovskite solar cells (PSC) by ¥15
billion to ¥64.8 billion.

Sumitomo, Toho Gas, etc to establish CCS network in Japan and Australia
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 8)
•  Sumitomo Corporation, Toho Gas, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line) and Australia’s Woodside Energy
will begin a study to develop a CCS value chain connecting Japan and Australia. Their goal is to

collect CO2 emissions from Chubu Pref, liquefy them, and transport them to Australia on
specialized ships.
•  The study will identify technical challenges related to CO2 separation, capture, transportation, and
storage.
•  The group plans to leverage Toho Gas technology that utilizes unused heat from LNG for CO2
separation and capture. The goal is to commercialize this by 2030.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

KEPCO, Woodside ink agreement on CCS
(Company statement, Sept 5)
o  Kansai Electric and Australia’s Woodside Energy signed an MoU to study CO2 capture,
transport, storage and utilization.
o  KEPCO will capture carbon at its thermal power stations and transport it to Woodside’s
storage sites in Australia. It will inject the CO2 underground and possibly use the gas for

synthetic methane production.
• TAKEAWAY: Japanese utilities are testing chemical absorption carbon capture technologies at thermal power
plants. Carbon separation equipment usually targets the gas industry, which deals with a different emissions
mix. Power stations’ capture costs are quite high.



JERA supplies U.S.-made blue ammonia to Germany's Uniper
(Company statement, Sept 5)
•  JERA Americas inked a deal to sell blue ammonia produced in the U.S. to Germany's Uniper.
JERA’s plan is to produce approximately 2 million tons annually by the late 2020s, with a portion
planned for sale to Uniper.
•  JERA is also considering directing the remaining blue ammonia to countries in Asia, including

Japan.
•  Currently, JERA Americas and its U.S. partner, ConocoPhillips, are progressing with the basic
design of a hydrogen production and ammonia conversion plant. The plant is planned for
construction by the Gulf of Mexico.
•  CONTEXT: Hydrogen, the raw material for ammonia, can be produced from natural gas. Adding
CCS technology to capture the emissions qualifies the end product as "blue." However, in the

future, JERA is also considering "green" ammonia production pathways.



INPEX studies building ammonia plants in U.S. and UAE
(Bloomberg, Sept 6)
•  INPEX is exploring building ammonia production plants in the U.S., eyeing opportunities in
hydrogen, ammonia and carbon capture. An ammonia plant in Abu Dhabi is also possible.
•  The company sees rising demand for ammonia to supply coal co-firing power generation and as

fuel for ships.

China expands market share in EV supply chains: Nikkei survey

(Nikkei, Sept 4)
•  Chinese companies are increasing their presence in global EV supply chains, gaining an over 30%
market share in batteries and key battery components, according to a Nikkei survey.
•  In 2022, Chinese companies held a 60% market share in EV lithium-ion batteries (LiB), and a 63%
share for LiB insulators. Their combined market share was 27.7%, beating Tesla’s 18.9%.
•  The Nikkei survey covered 63 core industrial products. Chinese companies had over a 30% share in

13 of these products.
• TAKEAWAY: The survey shows it’s becoming more difficult to decouple from Chinese manufacturers as the
global EV supply chains remain highly reliant on Asia’s biggest economy. However, most EVs and batteries
made in China were produced for the domestic market. Chinese EV and battery components are typically
tightly integrated to save space and improve power efficiency, but they are more difficult to recycle. Some
policymakers say one way to protect Japanese companies is by implementing stricter recycling standards in
Japan. They say high local standards will help improve Japanese tech competitiveness in overseas markets.




JFE to issue new shares, bonds to raise $1.4 billion for its net zero effort

(Company statement, Sept 5)
•  JFE Holdings will issue new shares worth ¥121.5 billion ($832 million) and bonds of ¥90 billion
($616 million) in overseas markets to finance net zero initiatives.
•  Major investments include: ¥95 billion for a 3.5-year ramp up of electrical steel sheet production
capacity; ¥15 billion to build a new electric arc furnace in Chiba for stainless steel production, ¥15
billion for JVs with India’s JSW Steel, and ¥75 billion for R&D of steel manufacturing processes and
business investments.
•  CONTEXT: Demand for electrical steel, which is composed of iron ore and silicon, is on the rise as

it’s used for electromagnetic devices and is essential for EV motors, power distribution,
transformers and other components. JFE’s net zero R&D projects include cutting emissions in
steelmaking and recycling carbon into methanol.
• TAKEAWAY: In the past decade or so, JFE Steel’s product strategy has been to use as little nickel and other
critical raw materials as possible to offer less expensive value added steel. While electrical steel hardly contains
critical metals, demand for nickel-containing stainless steel will surge for building corrosion-resistant hydrogen,

ammonia and carbon recycling infrastructure. It will be interesting to see what kind of products the new Chiba
stainless steel plant will offer to meet the new infrastructure demands.

Japan to allocate ¥20.7 billion to fishery industry over China’s import suspension
(Nikkei Asia, Sept 4)
•  Japan will allocate ¥20.7 billion in additional relief for its fishery industry, which faces a seafood
import ban by China due to concerns over treated water released from the Fukushima NPP.
•  The goal is to support the fishery industry by increasing domestic consumption, ensuring

sustainable seafood production, addressing reputational damage, exploring new overseas markets,
and providing compensation. In total, the govt will provide ¥100 billion to the industry through
various funds.
•  Japan also plans to diversify its seafood export channels to reduce dependency on China, while
urging China to engage in scientific discussions about the environmental impact of the water
discharge.

•  CONTEXT: Tensions between Japan and China have escalated over the water discharge. Japan
argues the water is safe, while China has imposed a blanket import ban on Japanese fishery
products.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO responds with measures to China’s food import suspension
(Nikkan Kogyo, Sept 5)

o  TEPCO announced additional measures in light of China's import suspension of
Japanese seafood due to the release of treated water from the Fukushima NPP.
o  They’ll set up a consultation support center for affected businesses in Miyagi Pref and
increase the number of personnel involved in the response from the initially planned 400
people nationwide to 1,000 people by the end of the year.
o  The company may add further consultation centers in Hokkaido, Kansai, and Kyushu.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan submitted a complaint to the WTO regarding the Chinese ban and seeks discussions

through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (a multilateral trade pact in which Japan and
China are also members). To diversify domestic seafood exports, Japan has promised incentives to businesses
entering new markets other than China. However, this is difficult because along with Hong Kong (which has
mirrored mainland China’s actions) China is the leading market for Japanese seafood, comprising about 40%
of seafood exports.

•  The company is expected to post its highest profit in 18 years by March 2024, with a consolidated

net profit forecasted at ¥305 billion for the fiscal year.
•  This surge in stock price follows a period of stability in the range of ¥1,100 to ¥1,300 and a recent
announcement of robust financial performance.
• TAKEAWAY: Like all nuclear power operators, KEPCO was hit hard by the 2011 Fukushima disaster. However,
KEPCO is the most dependent of Japan’s utilities on its nuclear reactors for both electricity volumes,
environmental impact and finances. The Kansai utility has had a rough past decade, spending vast sums to
import fossil fuels as an alternative. Now, with the state again backing nuclear power and all of its reactors

restarted, the company has seen profits return and its stock price has followed.

boosting efficiency of decommissioning work. Project cost is estimated at about ¥5 billion, with
support from state incentives and venture capital.




Asilla uses AI to guard against electric cable thefts
(New Energy Business, Sept 4)
•  Asilla is using AI to take measures against copper electric cable thefts. The company develops
behavior recognition AI technology to detect dangers, find lost children, analyze purchasing
behavior, and suspicious behavior.
•  The service consists of advice and support by security experts, as well as more basic consulting for

security measures.
•  CONTEXT: See also Japan NRG Aug 21 issue for copper cable thefts in Gunma Pref, which has
less solar power stations than its neighbors but has a high concentration of overhead transmission
power lines. Theft cases are spreading nationwide. Recently, Tokyo Infrastructure Energy
Investment said their Ushuku 2 MW power station lost 30% of power capacity due to a copper
cable theft.

• TAKEAWAY: Copper prices ranging above $8,000/ ton are triggering thefts globally. The cut-off cables are
sold as scrap at discount prices; but cables with no corrosion may fetch higher prices. Power stations with old
equipment are less targeted than new ones.

Green lawmaker Akimoto arrested for alleged offshore wind bribery
(NHK, Facta, Japan NRG, Sept 7)
•  Lawmaker Akimoto Masatoshi was arrested for allegedly taking ¥60 million in bribes from former
Japan Wind Development president Tsukawaki Masayuki.
•  Akimoto is accused of facilitating JWD’s offshore wind businesses by leading parliamentary

debates in favor of JWD in 2019.
•  Akimoto denied the allegation, saying the money was for a horse owned by the two individuals.
Tsukawaki, the former JWD president, has not been arrested yet.
•  CONTEXT: Since his first election into the House of Representatives in 2012, Akimoto’s focus has
been on energy, advocating renewable and anti-nuclear causes. He served as the parliamentary
vice minister of MLIT from 2016 to 2018, and has been active in the House committees on METI

and MLIT affairs in recent years.
•  Akimoto is accused of influencing state policies to benefit the company, including advocating for
less restrictive regulations on wind projects and asking the govt to revise the evaluation criteria for
offshore wind power auctions in which JWD also happened to participate.
• TAKEAWAY: If found guilty of receiving bribes and influencing offshore wind rulemaking, he will face a prison
term of up to seven years. It remains to be seen if investigative efforts expand outside of the Akimoto-JWD

nexus and if there’ll be separate probes by third parties that may lead to a review of wind auction rules.



Chubu Electric to reduce electricity bills for households

(Asahi, Sept 7)
•  Chubu Electric announced a reduction in electricity bills for the average household over two
months (Jan-Feb) next year. This discount, applicable to households with members aged 22 or
younger, or 65 or older, amounts to a 10% reduction in electricity fees.
•  Chubu Electric's improved financial performance allows them to return around ¥130 billion of the
¥200 billion obtained from a business fee increase to customers, with approximately ¥3 billion

allocated for discounts for households.
•  Additionally, a discount on business fees of ¥2.09/ kWh, already in place from June to Oct, will
continue until March.

JERA open to new LNG deal with Qatar, if terms are right
(Bloomberg, Sept 7)
•  JERA global CEO Kani said the company is in talks with Qatar about a new long-term LNG deal
but is seeking “win-win” terms. Any deal will only happen “if we find some common ground.”
•  JERA allowed a massive 5.5 million mt/ year contract with Qatar to expire at the end of 2021
because the seller would not offer more flexible terms.
•  CONTEXT: Typically, Qatar does not allow buyers to dictate changes to agreed supply volumes or

the destination at which the cargo must be received, and does not allow re-sale before delivery.
• TAKEAWAY: Walking away from a contract that supplies a significant portion of Japan’s 70 million tons of LNG
imports each year was not only a major energy and commercial decision, it caused ripples in political relations
between Japan and Qatar. The tensions may only have been eased recently after PM Kishida’s visit to the
country. But the fact remains: Qatar wants the sales contract to have a high number of parameters fixed in
stone, whereas for Japan, and JERA in particular, more flexibility is paramount given weather volatility,

uncertainty about future gas demand, and other factors. It would be a major change for Qatar to agree on
different terms. But with the U.S. eagerly taking market share thanks to a much greater degree of flexibility by
suppliers, Qatar may see a benefit from adjusting its stance.



Suzuki Motor and Indian dairy farms to build biogas plants
(Company statement, Sept 7)
•  Suzuki Motor group, the National Dairy Development Board and Banas Dairy agreed to build four
biogas plants in the Gujarat state of India. The total investment is estimated at ¥4 billion.
•  The biogas will be generated from fermented cow manure. It will be converted into methane, then
into car fuel. “Biogas filling stands” will also be set up at the biogas plants to supply drivers.

•  The plant operation is set for 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: Livestock manure-derived biogas is spreading globally as many govts consider biogas-derived
fuel and electricity to be carbon neutral, although emissions are still released in the gas production process
(notably, in the heating of the manure and compression of the biogas). Previously, biogas’ main use was
electricity generation but it has now expanded to vehicle fuel, hydrogen and methanol production, which are
possibly more profitable. Plastic manufacturers are developing biodegradable green plastics using manure-

derived methanol, expecting regulatory tightening of non-biodegradable plastic use in consumer goods.


LNG stocks at power utilities plunge to lowest since Feb 2022

(Government data, Sept 6)
•  LNG stocks of 10 power utilities stood at 1.73 million tons as of Sept 3, down 13.9% from 2.01
million tons a week earlier. The stocks were the lowest since 1.69 million tons in Feb 2022.
•  The end-September stocks last year were 2.66 million tons. The five-year average for this time of
year was 2.06 million tons.

ANALYSIS

BY JOHN VAROLI

Japan and Critical Raw Materials:
Scouring the Globe for Friendly and Reliable Sources

Since the war in Ukraine divided the global market into two hostile blocs, Japan has
had to seek out alternatives to its closest neighbors, Russia and China, for supplies of
energy, as well as the metals and critical raw materials (CRMs) that are crucial for the
energy transition, which is accelerating with the recent passage of the GX.

This new urgency is forcing Japan to look much farther from home for supplies, which
in turn increases costs and raises other potential geopolitical risks.

Russia is a major global supplier of aluminum, nickel, palladium and vanadium
production, while many of the world's rare earth metals, such as dysprosium and
neodymium, are primarily sourced in China. These metals and CRMs are essential for
clean energy technologies, such as electric vehicle motors, solar panels and wind
turbines.

Sanctions targeting Russia have excluded it from being a big supplier to G7 countries,
and growing tensions with China are also leading to supply chain disruptions. Last
month, China began to restrict exports of the rare metals gallium and germanium.

Japan and its G7 allies worry that China will restrict other critical minerals in the near
future. Therefore, the Japanese government is seeking solutions. JOGMEC is the
state company that will lead this search for CRMs abroad. While close allies in North
America and Australia are obvious partners, Africa, the Middle East and India are also
now of major interest as potential sources of cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel and other
CRMs.

In addition, Japan is eyeing projects with ASEAN nations to recover CRMs from
industrial and consumer waste. In short, Japan is open to innovative ideas and
scouring the globe for CRM supply that not only reduces emissions but also
geopolitical risk.


CRM club and rivalry in Africa
As a densely-populated island nation of 125 million people who live on a surface area
smaller than California, Japan has to procure most of its natural resources from
abroad. Over the past decades, this has made the country highly dependent on both
allies and rivals. Such a geographical disadvantage, however, means that Japan has
plenty of experience in managing supply chain shocks.

Prime Minister Kishida believes that western-oriented countries should diversify
procurement through the Critical Raw Material Club concept, and strengthen
communication between consuming and resource-rich countries. Japanese and
European companies have pledged to build up inventories and identify potential
chokepoints in supply chains. Toward that goal, earlier this year Japan signed bilateral
agreements with the EU and the U.S.

| future. Therefore, |

In March, Tokyo formalized an agreement with Washington to promote fair
competition and market-oriented conditions for trade in CRMs, and to ensure
transparent, and equitable critical minerals supply chains. In early July, Japan signed a
similar agreement with the EU.

Finally, last week, METI minister Nishimura traveled to the UK to discuss cooperation
on developing CRM production, especially in Africa, and strengthening supply chains.

Africa is going to be a region where all three allies – the U.S., EU and Japan – will
compete to secure supplies of CRMs. In Africa, Japan is starting a new era of activity
focusing on the continent’s mining sector, building on years of diplomacy and pilot
investments in Botswana and South Africa. Towards that goal, Nishimura visited five
African countries in August.

Japan now plans to collaborate with Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and
Namibia to develop supply chains for cobalt and other materials used in EV batteries.
This move will also help counter efforts by Russia and China to control stakes in
Africa’s mining industry.

Infrastructure development is crucial for mining economies, requiring collaboration
among multiple companies. As the state natural resources corporation, JOGMEC is
leading the charge for Japan, for example engaging with African countries to provide
remote sensing technology that will identify potential mining sites using satellite
imagery.

In Namibia, the goal is to reinforce the supply chain especially for rare earth metals.
On August 8, during the METI minister’s visit, Japan agreed with Namibia’s Ministry of
Mines and Energy to expand bilateral mining sector cooperation. Next year, both
countries plan an event in Tokyo that will focus on Namibia’s mining prospects.

Congo, which is Africa's top producer of cobalt, copper and lithium, is set to be a
major area of competition and geopolitical rivalry. The situation there is complicated
by a strong Russian and Chinese presence. China holds a 68% stake in Sicomines, the
copper and cobalt joint venture with Congo’s state mining firm Gecamines.

While Africa is a leading growth opportunity, the continent is fraught with challenges.
Leaders tend to be charismatic strongmen. Japan’s staid and conservative corporate
culture will be tested by the need to form long-term partnerships for high-risk
projects. Also, the perennial threat of asset nationalization is stronger in Africa than in
many alternative destinations.


Global sourcing
To help ensure stable supplies of CRMs, in mid July, PM Kishida met with Crown
Prince Mohammad bin Salman in Saudi Arabia to expand their relationship from one
based on fossil fuel sales (mainly, crude oil and natural gas) to close cooperation in
clean energy and mining.

Saudi Arabia also has substantial deposits of bauxite, phosphate, copper, gold, iron,
and zinc. In 2020, the nation launched the "National Strategy for the Mining Sector,"
which has the goal of developing mining into a third pillar of the country's industrial
base after oil and petrochemicals.

| competition and market-oriented conditions for trade in CRMs, and to ensure |
| --- |
| transparent, and equitable critical minerals supply chains. |

PM Kishida was particularly keen to entice Saudi Arabia to jointly invest in rare earths
mines and refining facilities in third countries, as well as in the production of hydrogen
and ammonia, and e-fuels. In turn, Japan aims to help accelerate the development of
resources already mined in Saudi Arabia, such as copper, iron and zinc. Once again,
JOGMEC will play a major role, contributing expertise to assist Riyadh in conducting
geological surveys.

Meanwhile, in South America, Chile is a major target of Japanese investment. JX
Metals group company, Pan Pacific Copper (PPC), continues to develop the
Escondida mine in the Atacama Desert; local concentrate is then processed into
copper cathodes at the Saganoseki smelter in Japan.

Trading house Mitsubishi Corp is also involved in Chile, recently taking a 5% stake in
the Canadian-controlled company, Marimaca Copper, which aims to produce 50,000
tons of copper cathode per year for 15 years. Production will begin by about 2030.

Across the Pacific Ocean, in Australia, Idemitsu Kosan is securing lithium supplies. In
mid June the company acquired a 15% stake in Delta Lithium Ltd for A$53 million.
The company runs two projects in Western Australia: the Mt. Ida project that holds
about 12.7 million tons of lithium reserves and the Yinnethara project.


Recycling
In addition to primary metals production, Japan is exploring the opportunities of
urban mining – the recycling of electronic waste. To get scale, the focus of recycling
for Japan lies in Southeast Asia.

At the end of August, Japan announced a collaboration with ASEAN countries to
extract valuable materials from discarded electronic devices such as smartphones.
With electronic waste in ASEAN reaching 3.5 million tons in 2019 and that volume
growing, the partnership will establish rules for waste disposal to address
environmental and health concerns.

Japan plans to help set up guidelines for waste disposal, including systems for
registration and certification of collection and dismantling businesses.

While all the initiatives mentioned above are still in the early stages, the intensity of
Japan’s effort to secure the necessary supplies of CRMs is ramping up. Clearly this
issue is a top priority for the government, which recognizes that plans for the energy
transition will come to naught if the necessary supplies of vital metals are not
secured.

However, securing CRMs by setting up the infrastructure and supply chains is only half
the battle. The rest will be about the costs involved. Failure to secure competitive
supplies will raise the prices of clean energy production, and that would compromise
the main tenant of the energy transition – clean, abundant and affordable energy.

INTERVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

TOP INTERVIEW:
UK Biomass Specialist Drax Speaks on Japan Market and CCS

Drax Group is a renewable energy utility and a supplier of sustainable biomass. It
operates a portfolio of biomass, hydro-electric and pumped hydro storage assets
across four sites in England and Scotland.

The company also operates a global bioenergy supply business with manufacturing
facilities at sites across the U.S. and Canada, producing compressed wood pellets for
its own use and for export to Europe and Asia.

Drax has supplied sustainably sourced biomass to Japan for over a decade. It now
sees the potential to grow its Japan sales. To learn more about the company’s plans,
Japan NRG spoke with Okamoto Yasuhisa, Managing Director of Drax Asia.


Biomass Market in Japan
What is Drax’s interest in the Japanese market? What opportunities and scope do you
see right now?

Drax has several supply contracts with customers in Japan that involve the supply of
millions of tons of biomass over the next decade. The Japanese market provides a
great opportunity for Drax.

As a leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business, we are keen to
build new partnerships with counterparties that value not only our biomass supply
capabilities, but also our technical know-how gained from converting our own coal-
fired units to biomass.

Sustainably sourced biomass is a proven technology in efforts to phase down coal –
providing a reliable, renewable alternative fuel source. Drax would like to support
Japan in its decarbonisation journey.

We have transformed our UK power station from Western Europe’s largest coal-fired
power station into one of the continent’s largest decarbonisation projects. We’re also
uniquely set up with end-to-end biomass production, supply, generation and sales
experience which gives us the ability to support the Japanese industry in coal to
biomass transitions. We now have a Tokyo-based team.

Using Japanese Carbon Capture Technology
Drax installed a carbon capture system at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire. It
was made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and it was supposed to run as a trial for a
year. So, tell us how that trial went and what happens next?

We successfully held a pilot of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ (MHI) carbon capture
technology at Drax Power Station in Selby, UK, where we tested the technology’s
suitability for use with biomass flue gases at Drax.

20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

| TOP INTERVIEW: |
| --- |
| UK Biomass Specialist Drax Speaks on Japan Market and CCS |

The pilot captured around 300 kilos of CO per day and tested two of MHI’s
2
commercially available solvents. We selected the KS-21 solvent because it proved to
be the most compatible with our technology.
Following the pilot, Drax and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) agreed a long-term
contract for Drax to use MHI’s carbon capture technology in BECCS (bioenergy with
carbon capture and storage), which we hope to deliver by 2030. It will see the largest
deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation in the world. By
2030, Drax could be the world’s first carbon negative power station, supporting the
UK in achieving net zero by 2050.

We’re engaged in formal discussions with the UK Government about the BECCS at
Drax Power Station and hope to be able to deliver our first unit by 2030.

Japan Collaboration Projects
Any other collaboration that Drax has with Japanese companies in the UK, Japan or
third countries?

Through acquired Canadian assets, Drax was the world’s first company to contract the
supply of sustainably sourced biomass to Japan with a modest start in 2009. This has
grown to about two million tons per year over the past decade, which we intend to
double by 2030.

We’ve worked in partnership with several Japanese companies during this period
including technology suppliers, dry bulk carriers, charter vessel suppliers and major
trading companies. An example of this is the work we’re doing with MOL Drybulk to
reduce the emissions and fuel costs associated with shipping biomass by deploying
wind power technology on its vessels.

Biomass Market Dynamics
How have the prospects for biomass power generation changed since the net-zero
announcements across the world? The sector seems to be growing, but not as fast as
sources like solar and wind. What are the constraints on new biomass developments?

Sustainably sourced biomass is a proven technology for supporting energy security
while phasing down coal. The global market for sustainable biomass is forecast to
grow significantly as more countries look to phase down coal from their energy
systems, creating growth opportunities to sell pellets to customers in Asia and
Europe.

Drax is well placed to meet that increased demand, with 18 operational pellet plants
offering capacity of c. 5Mt/ year and access to global markets in Europe and Asia from
ports in western Canada and the US south. Our goal is to increase our capacity to
8MT by 2030.

In Japan specifically, achieving the aim of carbon-neutrality by 2050 will require the
country to substantially accelerate the deployment of low-carbon technologies,
address regulatory and institutional barriers, and further enhance competition in its
energy markets.

Biomass generation has different constraints than wind and solar, such as
infrastructure, logistics and fuel sourcing requirements, however biomass is also
21

unique because it is a flexible, reliable renewable energy which can be turned up or
down to maintain a secure grid.

Intermittent renewable technologies such as wind and solar cannot do this.
Intermittent technologies also rely on baseload energy generation, such as sustainable
biomass, to support the grid when they are not generating.

Countries need multiple solutions to achieve Net Zero while maintaining energy
security. Realising those goals will depend on investment in innovative green
technologies across the renewables spectrum, which baseload biomass power can
support.

Are there any other technologies that you feel work well with / pair with biomass? Is it
batteries, or other renewables, or gas-fired generation, etc?

Drax has plans to pair its biomass generation with carbon capture and storage,
BECCS, Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). BECCS is the world’s
only shovel-ready, industrial scale, carbon removals technology. Carbon removals will
be needed to compensate for sectors with harder to abate emissions like construction
and aviation if we are going to achieve our Net Zero goals.

A recent University of Oxford study, “The State of Carbon Dioxide Removals” showed
that nearly all realistic global pathways to limit warming to 1.5C require developing
and deploying carbon removal technology and more renewable power – BECCS does
both. Drax is well placed to retrofit and build new BECCS facilities, making us ready to
support the global transition to net zero.

We’re accelerating our plans for global BECCS projects and have the goal to deliver
14 million tonnes of carbon removals per year by 2030.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ Coal
Australia will face electricity shortfalls in the next ten years as 62% of its coal fleet,
which supplies most of its power, will be retired. Power demand is expected to
continue growing along with the population and economy.

Australia/ Natural gas
Workers at Chevron Australia have gone on partial strike, threatening as much as 7%
of global LNG supplies. News of the strike sent European natural gas prices rising
almost 10%. A total strike is due to begin on Sept 14.

Brazil/ Carbon credits
State-owned oil company Petrobras made its first carbon credit purchase, buying
175,000 carbon credits from Projeto Envira Amazonia in the Amazon rainforest. The
company said it plans to spend at least $120 million in carbon credits by 2027.

China/ Coal
Since last year, China has approved 152 GW of new coal plants, more than all the coal
in the EU combined. The country’s largest coal companies are eager to build more
coal plants before 2025 since the government has prioritized energy security.
North America/ Natural gas
Canada’s Enbridge will buy three utilities from Dominion Energy for $14 billion,
creating North America's largest natural gas provider and doubling its gas distribution
business.

Norway/ oil and gas
Eni's local subsidiary, Vaar Energi, will increase exploration in the Arctic Barents Sea to
boost oil and gas production. Such plans have been met with criticism by
environmentalists, but in 2020, Norway’s Supreme Court rejected a motion to stop
Arctic drilling.

Pakistan/ Mining
Barrick Gold wants to invest $7 billion to revive the Reko Diq mine that’s believed to
contain one of the world’s largest untapped reserves of copper and gold. An
estimated $118 billion of investment by 2030 is needed to plug a supply gap that will
be equivalent to 35 Reko Diq-sized projects by next decade, says CRU Group.

South Africa/ Power outages
South Africa, which relies on coal for 80% of its power, is suffering from its worst
outages ever because the state-owned utility’s poorly-maintained and aging power
stations can’t meet demand. South Africa must move towards renewable energy to
avoid levies from the EU.

UK/ Wind power
An annual auction for offshore wind power failed to secure a single contract; major
companies stayed away, saying that the auction price was too low and costs have
soared 40% in the past year. About 3.7 GW of new clean energy projects secured a
contract, but these were for solar and onshore wind. In last year’s auction, a total of 11
GW in new clean energy secured contracts.

U.S./ Oil drilling
The Interior Dept will cancel oil and gas leases in a federal wildlife refuge that were
bought by an Alaska state development agency in the last days of President Donald
Trump. Joe Biden had pledged to protect the 7.7 million hectares habitat.
