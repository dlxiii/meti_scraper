NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


GHG emissions hit record low; focus on concrete, blue carbon initiatives

(Government statement, April 25)
•  Japan's total GHG emissions fell 4.2% YoY to about 1.017 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in FY2023,
a record low and a 27.1% drop over FY2013.
•  Key factors include increased decarbonization of electricity supply (renewables and nuclear
surpassing 30% of total) and reduced domestic manufacturing, says an MoE annual report on
National Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals.
•  Emissions of fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) fell 3.9% from the previous year to around
37 Mt, continuing the decline that began in 2022.
•  MoE reports that CO2 absorption through forests and blue carbon remained little changed YoY at
around 53.7 Mt, covering about 14.2% of total emission reductions since 2013; meanwhile, CO2-
absorbing concrete (CCU) expanded significantly to 121 tons from 27 tons in FY2022, with plans to
accelerate carbon-credit certification.
•  MoE also said that offshore blue carbon initiatives will be expanded. The govt plans to establish a
promotion system through the collaboration of the relevant ministries and agencies and public-
private partnerships.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan NRG has covered CO2-absorbing concrete in several prior Analysis texts and, while it is an
interesting technology, the usual issues of cost and consumer-side pressure are yet to be resolved. However, the
blue carbon initiative is worth paying attention to and could prove to be a niche but important part of Japan’s
strategy to reach NDC targets.

Ex-trade minister Seko comments on Japan-U.S. energy cooperation
(Facta, April 30)
•  CONTEXT: In an interview with the monthly magazine, ex-METI minister Seko expressed optimism
about the long-term prospects of Japan–U.S. energy cooperation.
•  Seko advocates using gestures, such as visiting sites like Alaska’s LNG fields and publicly expressing
interest as a tactic to resonate with President Trump. Seko even suggests the Alaska LNG project
might eventually become a Japan–U.S.–Russia trilateral energy initiative, once geopolitical
conditions allow.
•  Japanese negotiators must prepare theatrical, persuasive responses that appeal to Trump personally.
Seko also suggests using visual storytelling – such as maps showing Japanese investment creating
jobs in the U.S. and numbers-driven presentations – which was effective during past negotiations.
•  To counter trade shocks and possible recession, Japan must be ready with monetary easing, tax cuts,

and fiscal spending. Diplomatically, Japan should take the lead in ASEAN and act as a bridge
between the EU, TPP, and RCEP to uphold free trade.
•  Seko also praised Akazawa's recent talks with Trump, urging critics to focus on diplomacy and
results over appearance.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is mulling further U.S. investments as a way to avoid the potential economic blow of tariffs.
One such investment could be in the Alaska LNG, which could also aid broader geopolitical interests, especially
defense cooperation and energy competition with Russia. Taiwan has recently agreed to import LNG from a
potential future Alaska project and Thailand has made similarly positive noises. This adds pressure on Japan to
follow, but how the government and private companies would share the responsibility for such a large project
and investment is as yet unclear.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Sojitz launches carbon credit fund with U.S. firm
(Nikkei Asia, May 1)
o  Sojitz is launching a $200 million carbon credit fund in partnership with the U.S.-based
Ecotrust Forest Management and others to focus on sustainable forest management in the
U.S. Pacific Northwest. It will generate carbon credits.
o  The goal is to enhance carbon absorption by optimizing logging and promoting biodiversity.
Investors will benefit through carbon credits and financial returns.



Hitachi eyes growth from energy grid business despite Trump policy risks
(Nikkei, April 28)
•  Hitachi expects its power grid business to drive growth over the next three years, despite potential
U.S. policy shifts under Trump. In FY2024, its Green Energy and Mobility segment led profit growth,
rising 85% to ¥369 billion.
•  For FY2025, Hitachi forecasts a 15.3% rise in net profit to ¥710 billion.
•  A new three-year plan aims to boost operating margin to 13–15%, and expand services around core

businesses like trains and grid systems. It will invest ¥500 billion in data centers, possibly through
acquisitions.
• TAKEAWAY: Hitachi remains bullish on its grid business despite possible reversals in U.S. clean energy support.
The uncertainty of U.S. energy regulations presents a challenge for foreign firms, but Hitachi's focus on
diversified global growth strategies, including digital and green energy, is expected to help mitigate these risks.
This also underscores the global momentum behind energy infrastructure upgrades.

Regulator urges utilities to split non-fossil certs pricing from electricity
(Denki Shimbun, April 28)
•  Japan’s Fair Trade Commission recommended that major utilities clearly separate prices for
electricity and non-FIT non-fossil certificates in internal transactions between generation and retail
units.
•  The regulator flagged possible antitrust violations if utilities provide these certificates free to their
retail units but charge independent power retailers.
•  CONTEXT: Of the 10 major utilities, eight already separate pricing, while two continue unified pricing
under long-term contracts predating the establishment of the non-fossil market.
•  The commission also advised lowering the current minimum bid requirement of 100 MW for
renewable energy in long-term decarbonization auctions and supported allowing renewable projects
with battery storage to participate in capacity markets.




NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


EGC finalizes plan to revise imbalance charge system

(Government statement, April 25)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) finalized a proposal to revise the
imbalance charge system.
•  A key topic was the "Cumulative Price Threshold System," which lowers the cap on imbalance
charges in areas where spot market prices remain high.
•  Starting FY2026, the revised system sets imbalance charge caps at ¥50 when reserve rates are at
8%, and ¥300 when below 3%. If spot prices exceed ¥200 in 30 slots over seven days, the imbalance
charge cap in that area will drop to ¥100 the next day.
•  CONTEXT: The imbalance charge is a unit price that offsets the excess or shortfall of actual supply and
demand, and serves as the basis for price signals. This system is designed to impose reasonable costs on
those who cause imbalances and to provide appropriate incentives to system users.
• TAKEAWAY: Although expanding the system’s coverage to prevent price inconsistencies was discussed, it was
deemed unnecessary due to high costs and the low chance of such issues. The revised plan will be open for
public comment in May, and the new rules could start in April 2026 after official approvals.



Major utilities forecast lower revenue and profit amid rising costs
(Company statements, Denki Shimbun, May 2)
•  Nine of the 10 major regional power utilities (EPCOs) project lower revenue, and eight see profit
declines for FY2025, citing higher material, labor, and equipment costs due to inflation.
•  Only TEPCO has yet to release a forecast.
•  In FY2024, sales reached record highs for Hokuriku, KEPCO, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa due to
increased electricity sales. Operating profits declined at eight, except Shikoku and Okinawa. Still, six
companies saw their second-highest profit levels ever.
•  In FY2025, lower fuel prices and reduced electricity demand are expected to crimp revenue.
Challenges include inflation and competition in wholesale/ retail power. Costs are also rising.

o  Kansai Electric faces reduced nuclear plant utilization due to an increased period of time its
units will spend in scheduled maintenance.
o  Hokkaido Electric sees costs related to restarting Tomari NPP Unit 3.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Chubu Electric forecasts a decline due to rising grid maintenance costs.
o  Hokuriku Electric expects reduced wholesale power sales.
o  Shikoku Electric anticipates higher repair costs for thermal plants.
•  Most utilities are concerned over potential U.S. tariff impact; Chubu Electric noted that a similar
policy in 2019 caused a 2 TWh drop YoY in industrial demand in the region, suggesting possible
negative impacts worth billions of yen.

Electricity spot market sell-bids hit record high

(Denki Shimbun, April 28)
•  Sell-bids on the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) reached a record daily average of 1.327 TWh
in March, up 3.4% from February, driven by subdued demand despite increased plant maintenance.
•  Monthly total sell bids were at an all-time high of 41.1 TWh, a 14.4% increase MoM, while buy-bids
declined 2.8% to 29.55 TWh.
•  Daily average buy-bids fell 12.2% from February to 0.954 TWh, reflecting warmer weather and
reduced electricity consumption.



Hokkaido Electric eyes early launch of Ishikari-wan Shinko Unit 3
(Company statement, April 28)
•  Hokkaido Electric will move up the start of operations for LNG-firing Ishikari-wan Shinko Power
Plant Unit 3 to FY2033, four years earlier than the planned December 2037 start. This follows its
successful bid in the second round of Long-term Decarbonized Power Sources Auction, results of
which were disclosed on April 28.
•  CONTEXT: In 2023, the company delayed the start of Unit 2 to Dec 2034 and Unit 3 to Dec 2037. In
2024, they moved Unit 2’s schedule up to within FY2030. The power plant is being developed with
future hydrogen co-firing in mind. It currently has one 569 MW LNG-firing unit in operation.



Mitsubishi’s DGA joins ACEN for early coal-fired power shutdown in Philippines

(Company statement, May 7)
•  Mitsubishi Corp and its subsidiary Diamond Generating Asia (DGA) joined ACEN, GenZero, and
Keppel Ltd.
•  Their goal is to use transition credits for early retirement of a 246 MW coal-fired power plant in the
Philippines. Mitsubishi and DGA offer this access to Japan’s trading emission scheme.

•  The plant's operator is South Luzon Thermal Energy Corp. It aims to retire the plant by 2030 instead
of 2040, and replace output with clean energy.
•  CONTEXT: Transition credits are a new type of high-integrity carbon credit. The award is for replacing
coal plants with renewables. This mechanism, approved under Verra’s Verified Carbon Standard, could
become a model for more coal-fired power plants to be shut down.
• TAKEAWAY: Retiring a coal-fired power plant can prove to be costly, especially in SE Asia. Estimates suggest
costs could reach $1 billion. By using transition credits, companies hope to bridge the financial gap generated by
the early dismissal.



Nagano village builds microgrid, aims for stable electricity supply and reduced outage
(Nikkei, May 1)
•  Ikusaka Village (Nagano Pref) is building a microgrid powered by solar and small-scale
hydroelectricity to supply energy to vineyards and public facilities.
•  The project includes a hydro plant using dam outflow (100 kW+), and is funded partly by MoE
subsidies. It’s expected to be operational by FY2028.
•  CONTEXT: Ikusaka faces frequent power outages due to its mountainous location and dependency on

electricity from nearby towns. The new grid aims to eliminate these risks while supporting the core
grape industry.
• TAKEAWAY: Combining local renewables, agricultural support, and disaster preparedness, the project is a model
of sustainable development for small communities.



Sumitomo extends UAE gas power plant contract
(Company statement, May 2)
•  Sumitomo Corp, TAQA and ENGIE signed a 15-year extension of its PPA with the Emirates Water
and Electricity Company. This is for the Shuweihat S1 power plant in the UAE. Launched in 2005,
the contract was set to end in June 2025.
•  The plant will shift from a combined power and water desalination facility (1.5 GW power, 100
MIGD water) to a gas-fired open-cycle power plant. It will have a reduced capacity of 1.13 GW.
•  The new configuration allows the plant to operate only when needed.

Marubeni signs offtake from and signals investment in Exxon’s Texas ammonia plant

(Company statement, May 7)
•  Marubeni and ExxonMobil have signed a long-term agreement for the annual supply of 250,000
tonnes of blue ammonia from ExxonMobil’s planned Baytown, Texas facility. The plant aims to
remove 98% of the CO2 emissions from the manufacturing process and produce up to 1 million tons
of ammonia per year.
•  The ammonia will primarily be supplied mainly to Kobe Power Plant (owned by Kobe Steel), where
it will be used for co-firing by 2030.
•  Marubeni will also take an equity stake in ExxonMobil’s project, laying the groundwork for a global
low-carbon ammonia supply chain.
7



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The final investment decision is expected in 2025, contingent on regulatory approvals and
supportive policy.
•  CONTEXT: The Bayston facility is expected to be the world’s largest of its kind, capable of daily
production of up to 1 billion cubic feet of low-carbon hydrogen.
• TAKEAWAY: This is one of the first major ammonia offtake agreements signed by a Japanese firm, following
several deals clinched by JERA. It is also the first major deal struck by a non-power sector player. The key point
here is that the FID is reliant on government support. This likely refers not only to Japan’s CfD auction but also
U.S. IRA credits.



China overtakes Japan in hydrogen patent competitiveness
(Nikkei, May 2)
•  For the first time, China has surpassed Japan in global competitiveness in hydrogen-related patents,
especially dominating in four of five key areas: production, storage, transportation/ supply, and
safety management.
•  Utilization is the only area where Japan maintains a lead. The rankings are based on a
competitiveness score from 180,000 patents filed globally between 2013 and 2022, analyzed by
Tokyo-based data firm Astamuse.

•  China’s lead is particularly pronounced in hydrogen production, where its companies benefit from
lower costs and large-scale systems. As of 2023, Chinese-made green hydrogen production
equipment costs are just one-quarter of those made in Europe. China now has 60% of global
electrolyzer capacity, with increasing overseas orders.
•  CONTEXT: Following President Xi Jinping’s 2020 carbon peak pledge, China’s annual hydrogen patent
filings doubled those of Japan. By 2024, the number of Chinese firms entering electrolyzer production
had surged to 100–200, compared to only a few players in Japan (e.g., Asahi Kasei, Toshiba).



Idemitsu lowers profit targets for decarbonization amid delays in H2 projects
(Nikkei, April 29)
•  Idemitsu Kosan might revise downward its 2030 profit target for its decarbonization business, citing
delays in commercializing next-gen fuels like hydrogen and ammonia.
•  Originally aiming for non-fossil fuel businesses to make up over 50% of profits, the company now
views a 20–30% share as more realistic.
•  President Sakai said the company will focus on balancing stable fossil fuel supply with energy
transition goals, with a new mid-term plan due later in FY2025.
•  CONTEXT: Despite the shift, Idemitsu continues to prioritize SAF and solid-state EV batteries, while also
exploring overseas production options. Fossil fuels still account for around 90% of its profits as of
FY2023 (end of March 2024).
• TAKEAWAY: Soaring material costs and weak demand, especially in hydrogen, have prompted a rethink similar
to that seen among global peers like BP and Shell.



TOCOM  holds 1st Tokyo green hydrogen trial trading

(Organization statement, April 30)
•  In May, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) will hold the first Tokyo Green Hydrogen Trial

•  JOGMEC will begin surveying sites in Japan to identify subsurface zones where naturally occurring
hydrogen can be economically extracted.
•  The study focuses on rock formations like serpentine and peridotite, known to generate hydrogen
through chemical reactions with water.
•  CONTEXT: Hydrogen emits no CO2 when combusted. The expected production cost of natural hydrogen
is as low as $1/ kg, making it much cheaper than green hydrogen.



Tokyo Gas to implement e-methane production test solicited by Tokyo Govt

(Company statement, May 7)
•  Tokyo Gas inked a deal for the Tokyo Govt's "Green Methane Production Project Using Green
Hydrogen and CO2 from Sewage".
•  The project will run from April 2025 to March 2027. It involves the production of e-methane using
green hydrogen produced in Keihinjima and CO2 derived from mixed gas containing sewage sludge
as feedstock.
•  This is the first project to produce e-methane by continuously feeding raw materials through pipes
without separating CH4 and CO2 from gases generated from sewage.
•  CONTEXT: Tokyo Gas Group has held demo tests for e-methane production since March 2022. The goal
is to examine the practical application of local production and consumption of e-methane, as well as
identify problems, and promote its use.

Booming BESS, Nuclear Retrofits Win Big in
Round 2 of Japan’s LTDA Auction

The second Long-Term Decarbonized Power Sources Auction (LTDA) confirmed the
explosive growth of Japan’s battery energy storage (BESS) market, as such projects
dominated both successful and unsuccessful bids.
The results underscore the technology’s growing role in enhancing grid flexibility and
supporting the integration of variable renewables like wind and solar. Additionally,
among the winners announced at the end of April were two pumped-storage hydro
plants, one ammonia co-firing retrofit, and one adjustable hydro project.

In the FY2024 round, total bids reached 13.61 GW, with 6.34 GW — roughly 47% —
awarded. Of this, 5.03 GW (worth ¥346.4 billion per year) went to projects ranging
from BESS and thermal plant retrofits to other decarbonized solutions.

An additional 1.31 GW was secured by four dedicated LNG-fired plants under a separate
category, reflecting the importance that energy planners put on LNG’s role as a lower-
carbon, dispatchable power source.
The auction also reflects government willingness to help cover safety upgrades of
nuclear plants, as four utilities secured awards for 3.15 GW. This is seen as progress in
the effort to restart long-idled reactors such as Tomari NPP Unit 3 and Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa NPP Unit 6.

CCS-equipped plants, synthetic methane, and ammonia co-firing projects – while
technically eligible – were excluded from this LTDA round due to pricing and technical
readiness.

Japan NRG examines the LTDA results in detail.

Big win for BESS
This year’s LTDA auction saw strong participation from both Japanese and international
players, especially in energy storage. As Japan boosts its renewable energy capacity,
battery storage is moving from a supporting role to center stage. With solar and wind
power growing rapidly – and regularly getting curtailed in the hours when supply
exceeds demand – adding more flexibility and balance to the grid has become a national
priority.
The latest LTDA auction results reflect this urgency. BESS projects dominated the
number of submissions. There were 27 BESS project winners and a total awarded
capacity of 1.73 GW.

In terms of project numbers, for the second year running the biggest winner was
Shirokuma Power. Last year, it helped Hexa Renewables score the most awards as an
EPC partner. This year, Shirokuma Power, founded in 2016 to develop and operate solar
plants, managed to secure 11 projects (total capacity of 377 MW) through its various
special purpose vehicles (SPCs) such as SRE and Aoba. The company is believed to have
submitted over 30 bids.


19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

A joint venture between U.S.-based Stonepeak and Singapore’s CHC and Taiwan’s HD
Renewable Energy were awarded five BESS projects each. Stonepeak and CHC’s venture
captured a total of 284.23 MW. The duo won 131 MW in the previous FY2023 auction.
This year, the venture also partnered with Shizen Energy on one grid-scale project
operating for six hours or more.
HD Renewable Energy secured around 300 MW (1.5 GWh) of BESS projects across
Aomori, Fukushima, and Hokkaido, with the largest of these nearing 100 MW. The
Taiwanese firm also secured 73 MW of capacity for two projects in Mie and Fukuoka
Prefectures last year.

Bison Energy, active in Japan’s solar market since 2016, won three projects totaling
197.75 MW, including a 129.79 MW long-duration facility in Fukushima.

Auction winners included big international utility names. France’s EDF Group secured
119.26 MW, the second largest capacity for a single BESS project.

UK-based Eku Energy was awarded 119.26 MW for its 150 MW/ 600 MWh Eshi project
in Okayama, one of Japan’s largest planned BESS facilities, expected online by 2030.
The contract is recorded as 119.27 MW after applying an efficiency adjustment. The
second win follows its first project, the 30 MW Hirohara BESS in Kyushu.
The strong showing by BESS operators is not surprising given the surge of enthusiasm
most showed in the LTDA last year. The big gap between the size of bids and awarded
capacities is what prompted the government to expand the energy storage allocation of
the LTDA to 1.5 GW for Round 2.

Overall, only a fifth of the submitted BESS bid capacity (6.95 GW) ended up as winners.
These were further split into 3–6 hour and over 6-hour systems as Round 2 encouraged
longer duration storage. Each of these sub-categories had price caps, but uptake in the
6+ hour category was low due to its perceived higher risk and longer development
time.
Just six of the winning BESS projects from Round 2 will operate for over 6 hours. One
more long-duration project – pumped hydro – was also selected.

Safety updates for nuclear power as new addition
Last year’s LTDA auction surprised by allocating a sizable 1.3 GW of capacity allocation
to Chugoku Electric to build a third reactor at Shimane NPP. This year, the nuclear
credits went to three existing facilities that need funding to complete safety upgrades:

•  Tokai No. 2 (1.056 GW)
•  Tomari No. 3 (902.1 MW)
•  Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 6 (1.195 GW)

All three have approval to restart from the Nuclear Regulation Authority, yet Tomari’s
green-light arrived just a couple of days after the auction results were published, leading
some to question the role that the government wants LTDA to play in the nuclear sector.
Still, the main challenge for the nuclear winners will be meeting their LTDA
requirements. After all, approval from the NRA is not enough to guarantee that a reactor
can restart. There is also the need for local consent, which remains uncertain amid
persistent public opposition to nuclear energy and complex facility upgrade processes.



20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Tokai No. 2, for example, faces restart delays due to seawall construction and a 2021
court ruling citing inadequate disaster preparedness. The plant must also coordinate
evacuation plans for 940,000 residents across 14 municipalities.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 6 faces financial and trust challenges. Fuel loading is
scheduled for June 2025, but full restart may slip to FY2026 or later if public support
and compliance with new counterterrorism requirements aren’t secured.

LNG as a transitioning fuel
While the LTDA system primarily targets decarbonized power sources, it also includes a
limited provision for LNG-fired power. Dedicated LNG plants are permitted to bid
through the third round (FY2025), provided they commit to full decarbonization by
2050.

Under this scheme, LNG is seen as a transitional solution to help stabilize the grid and
prevent short-term supply-demand imbalances. As the government obviously doesn’t
deem LNG as a ‘decarbonized’ source, only dedicated LNG-fired projects – offering
relatively low CO2 emissions and grid flexibility – are eligible to bid in the LTDA. These
projects must also begin decarbonization efforts within 10 years of starting operations.
In the FY2024 round, LNG-fired capacity secured 1.31 GW at ¥45.6 billion per year.
Four projects were awarded this year, with the category’s total allocation capped at 2.24
GW.

One notable winner in this year’s auction is Hokkaido Electric, which secured a contract
for its 569.4 MW Ishikariwan Shinko Power Station Unit 3 in Otaru City. As the final
unit in a 1.7 GW, three-unit LNG complex, Unit 3’s commissioning was accelerated from
FY2037 to FY2033. The Ishikariwan plant – Hokkaido Electric’s first LNG facility – is
central to the utility’s move away from coal. Unit 2, awarded in the FY2023 LTDA
round, is scheduled to come online in FY2030.
How LNG will fare as a fuel as Japan continues to decarbonize is unclear, and this likely
explains the weak interest in the LNG category this year. There were only four bids and
all were successful; but, even so,this left 2.69 GW unallocated. This year’s LNG category
was capped at 2.24 GW.

Future bids and challenges ahead
Ahead of announcing R2 auction results, the government disclosed proposals for
changes to the LTDA framework, set to apply from FY2025. The updates aim to address
rising construction costs and encourage investment in new power sources.
The introduction of differentiated Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) by
technology type is also planned, reflecting varying risk profiles. These changes aim to
better support long-term decarbonization projects and encourage the sector’s stable
growth.
Key updates planned for the subsequent LTDA tenders are:

•  Adjusted business return rates: The standard business return rate of 5% will be
modified based on the construction period.
•  Increased bid price cap: The maximum bid price was doubled from ¥100,000/
kW to ¥200,000/ kW to reflect increased construction costs.
•  Higher price cap for emerging technologies: The maximum price for hydrogen,
ammonia, and thermal power with CCS will be raised.
•  The proposal comes with new categories such as CCS and long-duration energy
storage (LDES) on the table.

Conclusion
While the FY2024 LTDA auction results highlight the growing importance of battery
energy storage systems (BESS) in integrating variable renewable sources into the grid,
the auction also saw progress in nuclear energy with awards for safety upgrades to
existing plants. Still, challenges remain in restarting these reactors due to local approval
and safety concerns.

Meanwhile, LNG continues to draw some attention as a transitional fuel, but future
changes in the auction framework suggest an interest from officials in incentivizing
other low-carbon sources, such as ammonia, etc. Yet, with BESS an oversubscribed
power source for two years in a row, it’s possible that the government will launch an
entirely separate auction for it.
The allocation of power to a variety of sources, including LNG, also raises questions over
the role of the LTDA as a tool to specifically support decarbonization. Still, with green
capital increasingly uncertain where to deploy, Japan has the opportunity to burnish its
credentials as a safe haven.

ANALYSIS

BY ANDREW STATTER
Energy Jobs in Japan: Making the most of a change in company ownership

Mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector are common. These range from a strategic
merger such as BP and JERA’s offshore wind businesses, as well as targeted acquisitions
to build capability as in the cases of Seajacks to Marubeni or Electroroute to Mitsubishi.
Or, as increasingly seen in the market, it might be corporate acquisitions targeting the
clean energy portfolio as illustrated by NTT’s majority acquisition of Green Power
Investment.
In fact, many companies in the energy space begin with the end in mind. Development
platforms sponsored by private equity funds typically have a limited investment time
horizon in which they will maximise portfolio value with a view to exit at a certain time.

As an employee, how can you act and react to such changes? What opportunities exist in
a change of ownership situation, and what threats should you be aware of and prepared
to navigate?

Which side are you on?
A jumping off point for this inquiry would be whether you are with the acquiring or the
acquired (or the majority or minority shareholder). Advantages on the acquiring /
majority side are:
•  Tendency for upper management positions to be filled by majority stakeholders
providing fast-track, career step-up opportunities;
•  Strategic direction, company culture, rules and benefits are usually shaped by
the acquiring company;
•  The inevitable impacts of change within the business will be lesser;
•  Opportunity to become exposed to new technologies, projects, and business
without changing your company.

Does this mean that if you are on the side of being acquired or taking a minority stake
that you should be looking for the exit doors as soon as you catch wind of the news?
Discretion must be exercised, but we should bear in mind potential benefits that can roll
to the minority side as well.
•  Management independence. An acquisition does not necessarily mean total
assimilation into the proverbial ‘Borg’. Seek to understand whether the intent is
to allow your company to remain independent, and self-manage.
•  Potential career growth opportunities. It is not a given that the new
management team will be made up exclusively from the acquiring side.
•  Financial upside. Equity payouts, shares in the new company, structured earn-
outs may be on the table. However, even without these you may have the
opportunity to renegotiate favourable terms.

Knowledge is power
The more you know about the deal before it happens, the more informed you will be
and better able to shape your strategy. Understanding the deal structure itself to identify
ownership structure, management plan and potential payouts is key. Beyond this, take
the time to learn about the company culture, working style, benefits and promotion
pathways on offer at the new firm. At a more granular level, study and assess the

25



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

strengths and weaknesses of the team you’ll be joining and assess your future value to
strategically position yourself in the new environment.

This can be relatively easy to do as negotiations take months and may be transparent to
an extent. However, in other cases the decision is made far above your pay grade and
you could wake up Monday morning to an announcement of new ownership!
Rule #1, prepare to stay and thrive:
Often, not all the answers to the questions we’ve explored above will be clear until after
the deal is done and well into the post-merger integration phase. Be prepared for the
best. Blind optimism is not what I am advocating for here; rather, control and influence
what you are able to.

Identify the key actors. As the management structure becomes clear, identify who are
the leaders, how they see success in the business, and what challenges they are
benchmarked against. Build a picture of not only the business’ general direction, but the
pressures that those above you are under. With this, you can position yourself to align
and be most useful. Side note on this: be mindful of actors who may have been
displaced and become disgruntled. It’s usually better to avoid being pulled into political
battles, and instead focus on results.
Create your strategic value. This can be a great opportunity for you to step up. By
identifying where your particular knowledge, technical skill-sets, relationships and
experience are strong, you can position yourself as a key asset. Assess and benchmark
yourself against people from the other side who may be in a similar role. A post-merger
risk is that duplication of roles is likely to emerge, especially in cases of similar
businesses combining.
Proactively solve problems. Despite the best intentions of motivated buyers, incentivised
sellers and experienced consultants, no integration has been perfectly smooth. Problems
will occur, friction will be an issue, cultures will clash and systems will be a mess.

Challenges = opportunities. If you are able to identify and lean into solving the
inevitable issues that come up, you will be viewed favourably by leadership, and
potentially create new promotion and growth pathways for yourself.

Rule #2, develop an exit strategy:
Not everyone will thrive in this environment. Especially at upper management levels
where positions are limited, and in roles where duplication occurs an exit may be
necessary. Even if your position or authority is not eliminated or diminished, the
working style, new management, and career prospects may no longer be desirable.
Preparing an exit strategy in parallel with doing what you can to thrive is the best
strategy. In any job change, people will factor in the trifecta of timing, role and
conditions. If you can eliminate timing from the equation and focus on securing an exit
that is an ideal position in a desirable firm at compelling conditions, it is ideal. In the
case that you wait too long and the company pushes for your exit, timing becomes your
overwhelming priority.

When should you start talking to your network and touching base with reputable
recruitment agents? Early is always better. You do not need to have made up your mind
to leave to initiate discussions with potential new employers. Be honest in discussions,
manage expectations of both potential employers and professionals supporting you. You
will not burn bridges by having conversations with potential employers and opting not
to join them, provided you manage expectations wisely. Conversely, being viewed as

26



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

passive talent will give you greater leverage in negotiations compared to someone who
is clearly desperate to escape.

Negotiate
In almost any situation in an acquisition situation, you can negotiate to improve your
position. Here are a few examples:
•  Regardless of which side of the deal you are on, look to negotiate a promotion
or broadening of your responsibilities.
•  If you’re on the side being acquired, this is a chance to renegotiate your
package to the new firm. More cash and stock options are the obvious targets;
however in some cases the acquiring company needs the human resources of
the target and are willing to offer cash retention bonuses to keep talent.
•  If you have an equity stake, the opportunity often has negotiable pieces. Partial
early payouts, transfer of stock value to that of the acquiring company, increase
in equity portion for the purposes of retention or building in a lucrative earn-
out clause.
•  If you are to be laid off, the acquiring firm has a vested interest for this to go
smoothly and for people to leave happily and not cause issues. Leverage this
into a strong severance package to buy you time to find your next opportunity.
In summary - be proactive, not reactive:
All too often we see people simply go along with the flow and accept what comes down
the line. The deal happened for the interests of leadership / owners / investors upstream
of where you sit; so it is on you to look after your own self-interest.

Post-merger integration creates competition and challenge. Be a player, not a spectator.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Pumped hydro
Energy major AGL Energy acquired two pumped hydro energy storage sites in NSW, totalling
14 GWh. The two early-stage sites, which are both 10-hour durations, were acquired from
renewable energy developer Upper Hunter Hydro Top Trust.
China / Oil refiners
Recent U.S. sanctions on two small Chinese refiners for buying Iranian oil have created
difficulties receiving crude. So, they sold the products under other brand names.

China / Clean energy
The Longdong-Shandong project has launched; it’s China's first "wind, solar, thermal and
storage integration" energy base delivery system. More than half of the electricity transmitted
by this UHV is clean power such as wind, PV, and energy storage.
China / Oil shipping
China is widening its clandestine supply chain that carries Iranian crude. A tanker identifying
itself as Global discharged about 2M barrels of Iranian oil at a Shandong port in late April.
However, the vessel was in fact a very large crude carrier called Gather View that’s sanctioned
by the U.S. and that took over the identity of a previously scrapped ship.

India / Energy security
As the conflict with Pakistan intensifies, India is boosting security at key energy sites, such as
power stations, refineries and LNG terminals.

India / Green hydrogen
Coal India Ltd plans to invest around $3 billion to set up about 4.5 GW of renewable energy
capacity, significantly bolstering India’s green hydrogen and ammonia production.
Indonesia / Coal
The world's largest exporter of coal for power generation shipped out 150 MT of thermal coal
over the first four months of 2025, said Kpler; this is the lowest in three years for that same
period. The drop was caused by weak demand in China and India – the world's two largest coal
consumers.

Indonesia / Oil products
Indonesia will cut its fuel imports from Singapore and source supplies from the U.S. and
Middle Eastern countries, hoping to find better prices. SE Asia’s largest economy will gradually
eliminate shipments of oil products from Singapore, which account for more than half its
imports, said Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia.
Philippines / Floating offshore wind
All three offshore wind projects developed by BuhaWind Energy secured Dept of Energy
approval. This allows prioritized permitting across various national and local state agencies.
Copenhagen Energy and PetroGreen Energy Corp founded BuhaWind Energy in 2022.

Vietnam / Electricity prices
Vietnam’s retail electricity price climbed 4.8%. Since early 2023, electricity prices in Vietnam
were hiked four times: 3%; 4.5%; and two times consecutively, at 4.8%.
