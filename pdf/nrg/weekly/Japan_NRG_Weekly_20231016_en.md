NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY







Tokyo Stock Exchange begins trade in carbon credits; J-Credits on offer
(Japan NRG, Oct 12)
•  Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) began trading carbon credits on Oct 11. Registered members can
trade the existing carbon credit format, known as a J-Credit.
•  The new market will simplify companies buying and selling credits, and provide transparency in
carbon pricing.
•  As of Sept 19, a total of 188 entities had registered to trade, said the TSE.

•  During the first day, trading volume was equivalent to 3,689 metric tons of CO2. The transaction
price for a J-Credit in the energy-saving sub category was ¥2,850/ ton-CO2; a J-Credit in the forest
sub category traded at ¥9,900 in the morning session, and ¥7,000 in the afternoon session.
•  CONTEXT: The TSE held a pilot from September 2022 to January 2023, initially allowing trading of
about 70 types and sub categories of J-Credits. However, the high rate of failed trades led to a
narrowing of the focus to six types, making it easier for trades to be completed. In April, Japan

began the phased introduction of a carbon pricing scheme to encourage companies and cities to
curb emissions.
• TAKEAWAY: The government wants to have a clear, definitive carbon price to better evaluate the costs of
different energy sources in a net-zero environment. In theory, this is a sure way to demonstrate how clean
energy technologies are cost-competitive. However, the challenges to forging a unified price on 1 ton of CO2
are not small. After all, carbon credits represent a “negative” value; in other words, the cost of avoiding or
reducing the existence of a ton of CO2, rather its creation. Seen in that light, pricing reflects the various

degrees of effort across disparate industries that CO2 reduction involves. At some future point, the carbon
credits market will need to reflect the differences. But as the trials last year showed, initially trading needs to
be as streamlined as possible to take root.




Nagano Pref to require solar operators to make “scenery protection plans”
(Japan NRG, Oct 10)
•  The Nagano prefectural assembly passed an ordinance requiring solar operators to file land
conservation and natural scenery protection plans, effective April 2024. The rule covers all new
installations above 10 kW, excluding rooftop panels.
•  Any solar project, no matter its size, in the areas reserved for forestation and natural disaster

protection, will require approval of the Nagano governor.
•  A prefecture official told Japan NRG that due to its wide scope, the prefecture is studying the
possibility of splitting regulatory oversight: 10-50 kW projects under local municipalities; while
projects above 50 kW under prefectural authority.
•  CONTEXT: There’s roughly 200 MW of solar capacity now in operation in Nagano Pref. Solar
restrictions started to emerge at village and city levels in 2021.

• TAKEAWAY: Four prefectures and 20 municipalities have similar ordinances on natural scenery protection,
targeting large installations. The Nagano ordinance is the most stringent.

Prefecture Solar installations covered by the ordinance

Hokkaido Over 5 meters in height, 1,000 sq/m

Yamanashi Over 10,000 sq/m
Hiroshima Over 13 meters in height, 1,000 sq/m

Shimane Over 1,000 sq/m

Nagano  Over 10 kW capacities




METI mulls changes in environmental impact assessment for wind farms
(Government statement, Oct 11)
•  METI plans to revamp the environmental impact assessment process, dividing potential projects
into three categories: 1) no impact, 2) possible impact, and 3) major impact on the environment.
•  The ministry plans to increase the items on its checklist to review project scoping and primary
environment consideration. These might include the amount of land refills, distance from the
nearest residential building, etc.

•  CONTEXT: In the first half of FY2023, the environmental impact of 44 clean energy power plants
were reviewed – 39 were wind projects, each over 50 MW in capacity. However, some large
projects were cancelled following community opposition.



Japan and World Bank launch effort to diversify global renewable energy supply chains

(Nikkei Asia, Oct 12)
•  The World Bank, Japan and several other countries launched the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-
chain Enhancement (RISE) to diversify renewable energy supply chains amid concerns over reliance
on China for critical materials essential for EVs and solar panels.
•  RISE aims to support emerging nations financially and technologically in processing raw materials
and assembling final products to ensure a stable global supply and to mitigate economic security
risks. With initial contributions exceeding $40 million, this partnership targets developing countries

in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
•  CONTEXT: China holds a significant share in processing raw materials and assembling EV
batteries. It accounts for 10% of global lithium production, but 55% of its processing. In total,
China holds a 75% share in battery production. At least 90% of substrates used in solar panels,
such as glass and silicon, are also made in China.

Toyota and Idemitsu partner on all-solid-state batteries production for BEVs
(Company statement, Oct 12)
•  Idemitsu Kosan and Toyota Motor have partnered to accelerate the mass production of all-solid-
state batteries for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), targeting commercialization by 2027-28.
•  Their collaboration will primarily focus on developing mass production technology for solid

electrolytes and enhancing productivity. They aim to improve sulphide solid electrolytes, which are
crucial for high-capacity BEVs.
•  The collaboration will progress through phases: developing and testing sulphide solid electrolytes,
initiating mass production at a large pilot facility, and evaluating full-scale mass production for
future commercialization.
• TAKEAWAY: Automakers are required to phase out gasoline vehicle production, but the Japanese market lags

behind the net zero trend as EVs account for only 2% of total car sales, and FCVs are less than 0.1%. Imported
EVs account for the majority of such sales in Japan. The local auto industry hopes that solid-state battery
development, not just by Toyota but also by other automakers, will be a gamechanger.



Honda Motor, Mitsubishi in talks to form EV-based power balancing venture
(Company statement, Oct 11)
•  Honda Motor and Mitsubishi are in talks to form a JV to offer vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power
balancing services through which EVs store excess renewable power.
•  The JV will be set up in 2024. Honda’s EV model “N-VAN e”, which will be released in spring

2024, will be used to store power. The JV plans to launch a service framework allowing vehicle
owners to sell power in 2026.
• TAKEAWAY: The govt is likely to push the spread of V2G as well as V2H (vehicle-to-home) services by
providing subsidies for equipment called “power exporter,” which is required for increasing power output
from batteries. Vehicle battery output is limited to 1,500 watts when not driving. Honda Motor told Japan NRG
that any Japanese EV and FCV models following the CHAdeMo charging standards will be able to connect to
the V2G network. Tesla models, however, are not compatible with CHAdeMo.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan looks to Qatar to boost LNG supplies amid concerns about future supply
(Nikkei Asia, Oct 8)
•  Mitsui is considering taking a share in Qatar’s North Field in the Persian Gulf, where two expansion
projects are in progress, both set to launch in 2026.
•  Upon completion, Qatar’s annual LNG production capacity is expected to hit 126 million tons,
overtaking the U.S. and Australia.
•  Mitsui’s final decision will be influenced by factors including contract term, price, and profitability.

The goal is to establish a Japanese consortium that has a stake in North Field, with power provider
JERA also evaluating participation.
•  CONTEXT: Japan is the world's largest LNG importer, purchasing 72 million tons in 2022, with
10% coming from Russia’s Sakhalin-2 project. As relations with Moscow have soured, Japan is
eager to secure LNG supply from friendly nations.
•  In Indonesia, Mitsubishi, INPEX and others are expanding production at the Tangguh gas field to

11.4 mt/ year. Of the increased production, KEPCO will procure up to 1 million tons to fuel power
plants.

Japan Asks Brunei for Stable LNG Supply
(Jiji Press, Oct 9)
o  Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa asked Brunei for a stable supply of LNG during a visit to

the country and met with Erywan Yusof, Brunei’s second foreign minister. Both agreed to
strengthen economic relations between Japan and Brunei.
o  Also, Kamikawa and Erywan said that Japan and Brunei will work together in responding
to forceful efforts to change the status quo in the South China Sea.
• TAKEAWAY: Since the war in Ukraine and western sanctions disrupted global energy supplies, Japanese
traders see Qatari LNG projects as a viable investment. The visit of Qatar's energy minister to Japan late last
month signaled potential for new LNG deals as concerns about security of supply mount, pushing more

diversification of procurement. However, historical tensions, contractual disagreements over LNG off-takes and
geopolitical factors still pose challenges to Japanese-Qatari cooperation. Notably, stringent terms for long-
term contracts could exclude Japanese companies from Qatar's LNG projects.




Activist fund looking to dismantle Cosmo, which is in talks with potential white knights
(Sentaku, Oct-2023 issue)
•  Cosmo Energy’s management believes that Murakami is intent on dismantling their business rather
than looking for ways to boost its value in the current shape. Cosmo management wants to keep
the oil and renewables businesses in the same company, seeing the latter as a carbon offset for the

former.

•  Cosmo will soon decide whether to hold an EGM to determine takeover defense measures. If 10%
of minority shareholders are unhappy with Cosmo’s current corporate value, it’s likely that voters
won’t approve takeover defense measures.
•  Meanwhile, Cosmo is searching for a “white knight” to come in as a major shareholder and defend
it from Murakami. The company is in talks with multiple parties, such as Kansai Electric, a major

Cosmo shareholder.
•  CONTEXT: Activist investor Murakami Yoshiaki has become one of the top shareholders of Cosmo
Energy Holdings, Japan’s third-largest oil refining company and also an investor in wind power.
Murakami seeks to change the company’s strategy, but management resists his growing influence.
In June, management won approval from shareholders to install a ‘poison pill’ defense that
effectively blocks the activist investor from owning more than 20% of the company.
• TAKEAWAY: After several rounds of industry consolidation, Japan is left with three major oil and oil production

wholesalers. Activist investor Murakami seems to believe that this is one too many. Aside from the corporate
governance angle, the situation touches on an important difference of opinion around the energy transition.
Some believe that traditional energy firms should not lead development of new energy systems; others see
this as not only inevitable but also a prerequisite for net zero.




Hamas-Israel conflict will be very long war: foreign policy expert
(Japan NRG, Oct 11)
•  The Hamas-Israeli conflict is likely to be “a very long war”, said Miyake Kunihiko, a former Foreign
Ministry official, now a research fellow at Canon Institute for Global Studies. He spoke at the

RISCON Tokyo conference.
•  Depending on if Iran gets involved, the conflict could spread to Persian Gulf states, eventually
impacting Japan’s energy supplies.
•  CONTEXT: The Middle East accounts for about 95% of Japan’s crude oil and a substantial portion
of its LNG supplies. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are Japan’s main energy suppliers in the region.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan will be cautious of any political statements around this conflict in case it escalates beyond
Israeli-Hamas fighting. Japan’s G7 partners have already strongly backed Israel, angering Arab countries; and

thus, Japan could suffer through guilt by association. This year, PM Kishida has worked hard to improve
relations with key powers in the Middle East. That success could be undone if civilian casualties on the
Palestinian side inflame public opinion across the Middle East and the global Muslim community.

Cable Thefts on the Rise,
Potentially Slowing BESS Investments at Solar Farms

This summer, copper thefts soared globally, most notably dealing a $200 million loss
to Aurubis, a Germany-based copper producer. Metal thefts are also rising in Japan,
where the number of such incidents in 2022 doubled over 2020’s levels, and will reach
a record high this year.

In Gunma Prefecture, copper thefts increased six-fold from last year, and the figures
are doubling and tripling in other prefectures. Half of the thefts occur at solar
operators, which are now forced to divert some of their budget earmarked for battery
energy storage systems (BESS) to facility repairs and security improvement.

Confounding the situation is the fact that the culprits are rarely caught, and so they
act with a feeling of impunity. Even if high copper prices subside, thieves would most
likely target other items from solar farms that can be recycled and resold.

If this situation is allowed to fester any further, it has the potential to become a national
economic and even international security issue. As states add protectionist moves in
the name of securing essential minerals, markets could fragment and prices elevate,
triggering even more thefts of metals in general and not just copper.


Solar panels as desired prey
From 2020 to 2022, metal thefts in Japan doubled from 5,478 to 10,368 incidents,
driven by strong copper demand. In Q1 of 2022, international copper prices rose
above $10,000/ ton, compared to pre-COVID levels of $6,000/ ton.

Prices subsided in the second half, and copper now trades at around $8,000/ ton.
Thefts, however, show no sign of abating, and in fact, they’re increasing at a faster
pace. This is in part related to the government lifting COVID restrictions in May. Since
then, requests for enhanced security systems from solar operators have surged.

“Inquiries from solar farms in the north Kanto region namely Ibaraki, Gunma and
Tochigi prefectures are up,” one security official told Japan NRG.

Number of metal thefts (copper, steel and alloy items)
2020                     5,478
2021                     7,534
2022                     10,368
Source: National Police Agency
Note: The police do not provide national data on copper thefts.

Ibaraki, north of Tokyo, accounts for over 10% of nationwide metal thefts, ranking it
top among prefectures. Ibaraki is likely the theft hotspot because it has the country’s
largest solar capacity – 4.4 GW. Copper cables at the region’s solar farms are the most
lucrative target.

“The thieves are mostly taking things of higher value. They tend to leave behind thin
cables and take the thick ones,” one Ibaraki police officer told Japan NRG.

Scrap copper cable retails at twice the price of scrap copper tubes, and over five
times more than aluminum or steel scrap. In addition, solar plants are easy targets
because their equipment is placed in wide outdoor spaces.

Nearly all solar farms are located in sparsely populated areas. Cables can be cut and
removed easily, requiring little manpower. Two to three people with large knives and
a truck to haul their prey away can carry out a heist in less than 30 minutes.

Solar plant thefts typically take place when it’s dark and there’s no generation. Power
stations supplying low-voltage power are targeted more than those with high-voltage
power.

With manned security seen as expensive, solar sites tend to rely on remote
monitoring. But operators often become aware of the theft only when they notice
power generation is low for hours despite ample sunlight.

To compare, wind, geothermal and hydroelectric power plants, which are also located
in sparsely populated areas, have not suffered copper thefts. Their equipment is
installed in buildings and often have walls or tall fences around the premises. Solar
power plants operated by regional utilities have also escaped thefts. They have
security staff monitoring the plants remotely, 24/7.


Thefts to slow BESS deployment plans
BESS is a vital part of renewables energy infrastructure, compensating for solar or
wind’s intermittency by enabling a stable supply of electricity and thus avoiding
curtailment. Reasons for intermittency include weather conditions and power grid
limitations.

But copper thefts are now slowing down or delaying battery energy storage system
(BESS) installations at Japanese solar farms as operators have to be careful of costs
amid tight profit margins, an energy consultancy told Japan NRG. Besides the loss
itself, insurance rates rise after the thefts.

Losses from a single cable theft can total around several million yen. Before these
incidents became common, operators were able to rely on their insurance. At that
time, insurance companies were competing for solar clients and some offered low
rates. The operators benefited, but that’s not the case anymore; insurance rates are
skyrocketing, one operator told Japan NRG.

| July 2023 | 1,392 | 714 |  |  | 51% |  |  |

For example, a 600 kW Hanyu City solar plant was hit four times by thieves in the last
three years. Now, the rise in insurance costs is pushing operators to take security
seriously. Thefts causing losses of over ¥10 million are rare, but do occur. For context,
a 1 MW solar operator on the Feed-in-Tariff would have received about ¥10 million in
2022 for supplying 1 GWh of power.

The current record is a theft of 6.5 kilometers of cables worth ¥45 million in Kofu City
in February last year.

Copper cable thefts exceeding ¥10 million
Date    Location           Stolen cable Value of stolen
length     cables
Feb 2022 Kofu City (Yamanashi) 6.5 km ¥45 million
Dec 2022 Hokuto City (Yamanashi) 3 km ¥19 million
Sep 2022 Sagamihara City (Kanagawa) 3 km ¥15 million
Oct 2022 Katori (Chiba)    3 km       ¥15 million

Mar 2022 Ota City (Gunma)  2.5 km     ¥13 million
Jul 2017 Kashima City (Ibaraki) 1.9 km ¥12 million
Source: Media reports

Total financial damages from the thefts include damaged equipment and lost revenue
from disruptions in generation output. One victimized 1 MW solar operator said it
took three days to restore the cables and restart power generation.

Bigger plants can remain offline for a week or longer, the operator said. The Hokuto
City government that operates the 2 MW power station, which was hit by a ¥19 million
cable theft last year, will take ¥100 million to fully recover from damages. The ¥15
million theft at a 1 MW power station in Sagamihara City saw total damage of ¥40
million.


Beefing up security
Aware of the grueling threat, plant operators are investing in security. A video
surveillance system for a 1 MW plant costs several million yen, including installation
work. A second operator has deployed an infrared ray intruder detection system but it
was setting off alarms when birds flew over. An AI-assisted surveillance camera was
offered as an alternative.

Camera systems, however, have limited impact. Japan’s privacy protection law does
not allow the use of high-resolution video with images of identifiable people. It is
legal to take high-resolution video, but in order to analyze the video, people in the
video need to be notified. Any changes in privacy laws would possibly invalidate
cross-border privacy data transfer agreements and would be challenging.

Since thieves are market driven, their target items are changing. Steel scrap may
possibly be the next target. Steelmakers worldwide are shutting blast furnaces that
use carbon-intensive coke and iron ore, and are building electric arc furnaces. Electric
arc furnaces use scrap as feed.

When the new wave of electric arc furnaces comes on-stream in a few years, global
scrap demand will inflate by several million tons/ year, likely outstripping supply.

Thieves could turn to steel fences on sidewalks or even rip out car bodies at
unattended EV and hydrogen charging stations.

Indeed, charging stations face the same vulnerability as solar plants: equipment and
cars are outside in an open space. One EV station manager told Japan NRG that he
feels no threat because he’s insured. That certainly provides a peace of mind at least
in the financial sense. But it’s also exactly what solar operators were saying just a few
years ago.

COLUMN:        ENERGY      JOBS    IN  JAPAN

BY ANDREW STATTER

Choosing a Representative in Japan: Expat or Local Hire?

As the Japanese energy market evolves, we’re seeing an increase in the number of
multinational firms investing in the country, and setting up a local entity and creating a
direct presence. Making a move to set up a local office is a big decision, and shows
commitment and intent to be active long-term.

Companies need to find the right balance between engagement with local
stakeholders and alignment with plans set by global HQ that has made this decision
and investment. This often leads to a challenging conundrum on whether to send an
expat to Japan or hire a local as the in-country director or representative.


Factors to keep in mind
Some high-level pros and cons for taking the expat route:

Pros:
• A known voice is reporting back to HQ, speaks the internal language and
understands how to navigate the company, gain approvals and investment, etc.
• Bringing a true expert from an advanced market can be attractive for business
partners, and also for purposes of talent attraction.
• As a non-Japanese, there’s more room to bend the rules and take a different
approach to the business.

Cons:
• Language and cultural barriers. Since Japan is a highly homogenous country, even
an expat with a high level of language and cultural understanding will be seen as
an outsider.
• Communication gaps with business partners, and failure to ‘read the air’ in
Japanese business can render the company to be a second choice, and then face
a struggle to penetrate the market.
• Risk of creating an image of a lack of commitment to Japan’s market.

On the surface it seems companies that prioritize internal communication and
alignment would take an expat route, while those who put local partnerships at the
forefront of their wishlist would invest in a local hire. However, the situation is often
more complex.


Maturity of your specific market
The Japanese energy industry has historically learnt from overseas markets and then
adapted to its own needs. Post-Fukushima (March 2011) the country has leaned
heavily on European players for the solar boom; the liberalization of the power retail
business was modeled closely on the UK market; and offshore wind is currently
looking to leverage European expertise, etc. This can lead to a window of opportunity
for a foreign firm to bring new value to the market. However, once the business
becomes localized, Japanese firms will hold a clear advantage.


22


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

A good example is the solar business. At the start of the FIT era, European firms
flooded the market and created a value chain largely outside of Japanese circles.
Foreign developers built projects with foreign EPCs, financed by overseas investors.
Once Japanese firms gained experience in structuring finance for MW-sized solar
projects, and gained the necessary engineering expertise, they became increasingly
competitive.

Currently, with a proven, de-risked business model, large Japanese firms with access
to powerful offtakers and abundant cheap capital have a stronger business plan and
value proposition than many of the foreign players that were dominant before.

On the other hand, areas where business models are not yet proven and not yet de-
risked will see a high level of interest for Japanese companies to partner with and
learn from foreign players from more mature markets. The BESS (Battery Energy
Storage) space is a good example of this.

The current Japanese market is heavily dependent on subsidies from METI. Local
players are typically developing small (<2MW) projects, both to learn how to monetize
and operate this asset class, and also because Japanese banks are not willing to
provide project financing since they also lack an understanding of how to scrutinize
and de-risk such projects.

Simply put, bringing experts from overseas holds higher value in immature markets.
However, it’s also important to ensure that this person holds genuine, valuable market
knowledge that will be seen as a strategic asset by local industry partners.


Image of commitment: are you coming or going?
As we’ve written in this column previously, the Japanese tend to value stability;
whether this be for a consortium partner, a technology vendor, or an employer.
Seeing a clear, long term vision for the local business and commitment is key to
winning business and talent here.

The message to the market is very different based on the timing of when a company
decides to put an expat in the top position at the local firm.

Sending an expat from Day 1, with a newly established entity is fine, providing that
two clear criteria are met. Firstly, that person brings real experience and value to the
market. Secondly, this person is seen as a temporary solution: their mission is to hire a
local Japanese leadership team to develop a succession pipeline and thus take over
the role once their expatriate assignment is over.

Successfully making this transition to a local hire after the first expat sends a message
to the market that the company has gained a strong foothold, has identified clear
growth potential and is comfortable in giving autonomy to the local entity.

On the other hand, assigning an expat to the role that was previously occupied by a
local leader sends a message that HQ has serious questions about the local market,
and are considering whether to continue investing or start making an exit. We can
already see examples of this in the offshore wind sector as subsequent bid rounds
increase in competitiveness, in supply chain complexity and material costs increase.

Representative or other key leadership position?
Consider also the vertical hierarchy of Japanese corporations. In a meeting with
multiple stakeholders, business cards are exchanged, and a hierarchy of who is who –
and who should be talking to whom – is established very quickly. This is reflected in
the seating arrangements and meeting flow. If your business is reliant on close
partnerships with local Japanese companies, then having a local hire as country
representative can ensure smooth communication and trust.

Sending an expatriate in another key role – Project Director, Technical Director,
Commercial Manager, etc – allows HQ to have their own person with home market
values in place without trading this in for a show of commitment to the local market.


Key points when looking at hiring a local representative:

• Agility. Many Japanese leaders come from large, well-structured organizations
with clear processes and manners of doing business. Test to see how many
different environments your prospective leader has been in, and how quickly
they’ve adapted. Even those who worked for one company their whole career
may have gained agility via secondments and overseas assignments.

• Decision-making ability. Beware of decision-making by consensus and
distributed accountability. Screen for risks taken, examples of your candidate
making a decision against the majority, starting a new initiative on the side, etc.

• Managing up. A ‘yes man’ is only acceptable when business is good enough not
to see their flaws. During your interview process, challenge your candidate to
criticize your firm; and to come up with a Japan-specific strategy that includes
pitching to you regarding the investment that they’ll need from HQ in order to
achieve their goals.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Australia/ LNG strike
Workers at Chevron’s Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG plants gave notice to resume
strikes from Oct 19, which could send prices higher. Workers are required to give
seven working days notice before stoppages begin. Negotiations are ongoing but
have come to an impasse.

China/ Diesel fuel
The U.S. and Europe are counting on Chinese exports to ease tight global supplies of
diesel, heating oil and jet fuel. While China is not a major source of crude, its growing
refining capacity has made the country a fuel exporter in recent years. Russia's ban on
diesel exports has sparked higher prices globally.

Finland/ Pipeline attack
A gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia under the Baltic Sea was damaged in
what may have been an attack. The gas in the pipeline comes from Russia. Gas
accounts for 5% of Finland’s energy mix.

France/ LNG
TotalEnergies signed a 27-year LNG deal with Qatar, extending France’s commitment
to fossil fuels beyond 2050. Starting in 2026, Qatar will supply 3.5 million tons of LNG
annually to France. This will be Qatar’s largest and longest deal with a European
company.
Mozambique/ LNG
Eni wll make a final decision on its second floating LNG project in Mozambique by
next July. The deal is “90% done”, the company said. The floating LNG ship would
start producing and exporting within four years.

Oil markets forecast
The IEA lowered its forecast for oil demand growth in 2024 to 880,000 bpd, from 1
million bpd, amid worries of worsening global economic conditions. By contrast,
OPEC forecasts that demand will rise by 2.25 million bpd in 2024. The difference
between the two forecasts is 1.37 million bpd, or about 1% of daily global use.

Russia and Iraq/ Oil policy
Vladimir Putin and Iraqi PM Al-Sudani met in Moscow to coordinate within OPEC+ in
order to stabilize world markets. These talks come as Saudi Arabia and Russia will
continue with voluntary oil supply cuts of a combined 1.3 million barrels of oil per day.

Russia/ LNG exports
Gazprom is against the Murmansk LNG export project planned by rival Novatek,
saying Russia won’t have enough gas for domestic needs. Gazprom had a sharp fall in
output in the first half of this year, to 100 bcm/ year. Murmansk LNG would receive
about 30 bcm/ year.

Venezuela/ Oil exports
Venezuela is circumventing U.S. sanctions by using a dark fleet of tankers and various
strategies to conceal their location. The dark fleet that ships Venezuela’s oil to
customers, mainly in Asia, has grown with help from Russia and Iran.

U.S./ Hydrogen power
President Biden announced recipients of $7 billion in federal grants across 16 states to
develop 7 regional hydrogen hubs to jump-start clean hydrogen production to supply
industrial users like steelmakers and cement plants.

U.S./ Oil merger
ExxonMobil will buy rival Pioneer Natural Resources in a $59.5 billion deal, making
the company the biggest producer in the leading U.S. oilfield. The deal combines the
largest U.S. oil company with one of the most successful names to emerge from the
shale revolution.
