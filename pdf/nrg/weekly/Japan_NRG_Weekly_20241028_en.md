NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Hydrogen Act that unlocks state subsidies goes into force, application deadline unclear

(Japan NRG, Oct 25)
•  The Hydrogen Society Promotion Act passed by the Diet in May went into force on Oct 23. ANRE
also published initial guidelines for applications for hydrogen/ ammonia purchasing subsidies,
which are often referred to as the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme.
•  ANRE said the timetable will be disclosed “in a little while” with the start and deadline for subsidy
applications unclear.
•  CONTEXT: Earlier this year the government announced the allocation of ¥3 trillion to subsidize the

purchase of low-carbon hydrogen or ammonia. The CfD subsidies would pay the price difference
between buying conventional fuel and clean hydrogen/ ammonia alternatives.
•  CONTEXT: The Act is meant to support the creation of several hydrogen hubs nationwide that
would include infrastructure for importing, storing, moving and utilizing hydrogen and related
clean fuels.
•  Overseas producers of low-carbon hydrogen or ammonia won’t be able to apply for the CfD
subsidies directly. Only domestic producers or Japan-based entities engaged in importing and/or

distributing the fuel in the country can apply. Overseas producers can partner with domestic
partners on hydrogen supply chains in Japan.
•  Also, companies involved in storage and domestic transport of hydrogen will be able to apply for
subsidies to cover part of the FEED engineering and construction costs.
• TAKEAWAY: See this week’s Analysis section for a detailed breakdown of the subsidies and their outlook.

SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
KGC partners with Hydrexia Singapore on hydrogen supply business in Japan
(Company statement, Oct 23)
o  KGC, 51% owned by Kitahama Capital Partners, signed an MoU with Hydrexia Singapore
to develop hydrogen supply solutions in Japan.

o  Initial efforts focus on the Ninja Energy Data Center where hydrogen-fueled cells provide
power, improving energy efficiency through heat recovery and facilitating a sustainable
power source for RE100 clients.
o  Hydrexia will provide magnesium-based, solid-state hydrogen storage technology,
offering a safer alternative to compressed hydrogen and enabling efficient hydrogen
production, transport, and storage.



METI, MoE draft report on legal issues and concepts for emissions trading system

(Government statement, Oct 18)
•  METI and MoE drafted a report on legal issues and concepts for the CO2 emissions trading system
to be launched in FY2026.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The report addresses concerns about "carbon leakage," where companies might relocate to
countries with lower carbon costs, and suggests that the government provide support to prevent
industries like steel and chemicals from moving abroad.
•  To ensure fair emissions pricing, it advocates for mandatory centralized trading to avoid market
fragmentation and imposing fines proportional to emission allowances.
•  Further discussions on the trading system’s design, including mandatory corporate participation

and certification systems, are ongoing in a dedicated carbon pricing working group led by the
Cabinet Office.
•  The main points to codify in civil law are rights pertaining to emission allowances, rules for the
trading of emission allowances, and the relationship with existing laws such as the Civil Execution
Act and Bankruptcy Act.
•  In emission trading allowances, major issues are discipline for traders and brokers, discipline for

emission allowance exchanges, and measures against unfair trading.
•  For a smooth operation of the emissions trading system, accounting must ensure stability,
predictability, and transparency between companies.
•  CONTEXT: A legal review is necessary because the purpose of Japan's emissions trading system is
to reduce GHGs in an economical manner, to "promote a smooth transition to a decarbonized,
growth-oriented economic structure" as stated in the GX Promotion Act, and to "contribute to the

improvement of people's lives and the sound development of the national economy."
• TAKEAWAY: Once Japan’s carbon credits market is fully operational, it could easily become as large as any of
the existing domestic energy markets. The move toward this, however, will be gradual as numerous
adjustments will need to be made in the operation and reporting of manufacturing and other businesses.



ANRE updates cost estimates of thermal and nuclear power generation

(Government statement, Oct 18)
•  ANRE updated its estimates for thermal and nuclear generation costs in FY2040.
•  Thermal power generation includes conventional thermal power, thermal power with CCS, and co-
firing and exclusive use of hydrogen and ammonia. The main differences from the previous
estimates set in FY2021 are:
o  Coal-fired and oil-fired power plants are only a reference in 2040 due to the difficulty of

building new plants.
o  Shipping will also be included in the reference cost because vessels are expected to be
used to transport CO2 from power plants with CCS.
o  Co-firing is set at 10% hydrogen, and 20% and 50% ammonia, and it’s assumed that
"blue" fuels will be imported from overseas and "green" fuels will be produced largely
domestically.
•  Nuclear generation assumptions have been updated as follows:
o  Capital and O&M costs are calculated based on the latest plant data.

o  Additional safety measure costs reflect the latest estimates.
o  Accident risk response costs are expected to decrease due to new safety measures, but
will be further quantified.
o  Nuclear fuel cycle costs are estimated to increase.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Renewable energy and cogeneration systems/ fuel cells were discussed at the second WG meeting
in August; a major discussion will take place at the next meeting.
•  CONTEXT: As the government moves forward with its review of the Basic Energy Plan, the "Power
Generation Cost Verification Working Group" was launched in July to estimate the power
generation cost of each power source. Before the current Sixth Basic Energy Plan was finalized in

October 2021, the cost of power generation was examined in the same way.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE to revise FIT/ FIP certification to avoid wind turbine radio interference
(Government statement, Oct 22)
o  ANRE proposed a revision of FIT/ FIP certification in order to be compliant with a new
Ministry of Defense rule to prevent radio interference from wind turbines.
o  When installing onshore wind turbines, it’s necessary to notify the Minister of Defense

before the start of construction; and if there’s an impact on defense radar, construction is
prohibited for up to two years.
o  FIT/ FIP certification for onshore wind will be "conditional" while any possible radio
interference is investigated; if any is found, certification can be revoked.
o  CONTEXT: This new regulation is due to the large number of wind turbines that could
potentially interfere with radar used by the Self-Defense Forces, as well as with radio

communications between satellites and ground stations.



IEEJ releases its global energy outlook through 2050
(Institute statement, Oct 18)
•  The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan released its “IEEJ Outlook 2025”, a forecast of global
energy supply/ demand through 2050.
•  The assessment is made using both a "Reference Scenario" that assumes a continuation of past
trends, and an "Advanced Technologies Scenario" that assumes the maximum possible
deployment of new energy and environmental technologies.

o  Global primary energy demand will increase 14% (over 2022 levels) in the Reference
Scenario; but would decline 6% after peaking in 2030 in the Advanced Technologies
scenario.
o  In both scenarios, primary energy demand in developed countries and China is on a
downward trend; meanwhile, other emerging and developing countries, including India
and ASEAN, are the main drivers of increased demand.
o  Energy conservation, renewable energy, and CCUS are particularly effective means of

reducing CO2 emissions.
o  Demand for fossil fuels is highly uncertain.
•  The report examines the role of LNG and natural gas, and energy security risk scenarios as ways of
dealing with the uncertainty of the energy transition.
o  LNG will continue to play an important role and demand will grow.
o  Various risks impact the stability and security of energy supply; and the risks of

underinvestment in fossil fuels, geopolitics, destabilization of electricity supply, critical
minerals supply, and cyber-attacks are particularly important.

•  CONTEXT: The IEEJ publishes its global energy supply/ demand outlook annually using its own
energy model that’s also used in ANRE's Long-term Energy Supply/ Demand Outlook and in
calculations of power generation costs. The IEA's "World Energy Outlook" and the U.S. Energy
Information Administration’s "International Energy Outlook" are both well-known global energy
outlooks. Since the three outlooks are based on different scenarios, they’re used as a reference for

comparison.
• TAKEAWAY: The IEEJ is the closest think tank to METI so it is safe to assume that its forecasts will be reflected
in the upcoming new Basic Energy Plan. Among the many takeaways, one that stands out is the support for
continued usage of LNG, which is expected to gain stronger support in the next Plan.



ANRE proposes criteria for a long-term qualified solar power operator

(Government statement, Oct 22)
•  ANRE proposed requirements for certification as a "long-term stable qualified solar power
operator" that will consolidate and efficiently operate small low-voltage solar power businesses.
•  The requirements include:
o  It must be a responsible entity that can earn local trust;
o  Long-term business operations are expected;
o  Projects can be implemented without the FIT/ FIP systems.

• TAKEAWAY: Starting spring 2025, the government plans a system to certify operators that can carry out
renewable energy power projects as “long-term stable qualified solar power operators”, and to discuss
measures to promote business consolidation. There are several ways to read this. One is that a certification will
raise the barrier for entry, further filtering out the operators without strong experience or desire to invest in the
solar industry over the long term. The initial result may be a drop in the total number of developers in Japan.
However, this certification may also be used to improve trust in new projects with local communities, which

should help to improve the rollout of new capacity over the mid to long term.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE seeks to strengthen cyber security for distributed power sources

(Government statement, Oct 22)
o  ANRE proposed to strengthen cyber security measures for distributed power sources.
o  Due to their limited impact on the grid, distributed power sources have not faced strict
cyber security measures compared to large-scale power plants; but there have been
cyber-attacks probing their vulnerabilities.
o  Even in the case of small-scale solar power generation, it is necessary to strengthen cyber
security because any device connected to the Internet may become a target.
o  CONTEXT: As DX progresses, the threat of cyber-attacks is on the rise, and the electricity

sector requires ongoing efforts to improve cybersecurity. METI’s Power Sub-Working
Group of the Industrial Cyber Security Study Group is charged with this task.

Idemitsu and Mitsubishi launch study for U.S. low-carbon ammonia supply chain
(Company statement, Oct 23)
•  Idemitsu and Mitsubishi Corp will explore efficient operations for clean ammonia carriers and
shipment terminals, as well as participation in ExxonMobil's low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia

project in Baytown, Texas, and the offtake of ammonia.
•  The Baytown project aims to capture 98% of CO2 emissions, with FID expected in 2025 and
production set to begin by 2029. It will produce 900,000 tons of hydrogen and over 1 million tons
of ammonia per year.
•  Idemitsu plans to use its Tokuyama Complex in Yamaguchi Pref as a key ammonia import hub, with
a target of supplying over 1 million tons annually by 2030 as a fuel and a raw material.
•  Mitsubishi is considering converting its Namikata LPG Terminal in Ehime Pref into an ammonia

terminal, setting up a supply hub to serve end-users from the power, transport, and chemicals
industries.



INPEX, Chubu Electric to study a CCS value chain between Japan and Australia
(Company statement, Oct 21)
•  INPEX and Chubu Electric will study a CCS value chain for Japan and Australia. CO2 would be
captured in Japan and sent from Nagoya port to Australia for storage.
•  The goal is to start CO2 injection around 2030. INPEX, along with TotalEnergies and Woodside,

holds a GHG storage permit in Australia's Bonaparte Basin. INPEX is targeting 2.5 million tons of
CO2 injection per year by 2030.
•  CONTEXT: INPEX operates the Ichthys LNG Project off the coast of Northern Australia and has
plans for CCS projects to store its CO2 emissions.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Akita Pref holds seminar on CCS

(Nikkei, Oct 25)
o  Akita Pref held a seminar on CCS to encourage local companies to participate. About 70
representatives from Akita-based companies attended.
o  A representative from Itochu Corp’s CCS business unit reported on the progress of the
"CCS Project for the Japan Sea-side Tohoku Region." The project proposes capturing
and transporting up to 1.5 million tons of CO2 per year.
o  The CO2 to be captured is from the Nippon Steel Oita Works and Taiheiyo Cement’s DC

Kawasaki Plant. Storage will be on Akita's coast, with Akita and Funakawa ports serving
as potential liquefied CO2 receiving bases.
o  The project is still in a research phase. An FID is expected by late FY2026. Seven
companies, including Itochu and Nippon Steel are overseeing the project.



Osaka Gas develops DAC technology for CO2 absorption
(Nikkei, Oct 23)
•  Osaka Gas is developing DAC technology to extract CO2 from the atmosphere, completing a
prototype using materials with micro-scale pores; this increases the surface area for more efficient

CO2 absorption.

•  The device is being tested at a research facility in Osaka, and incorporates a porous material called
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combined with amines.
•  Thanks to MOFs, the device can reduce energy consumption by 50% compared to existing DAC
technologies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Ventuno discusses using J Blue Credits to certify CO2 absorption from seaweed
(Nikkei, Oct 21)
o  Ventuno seeks certification for carbon credits for CO2 absorbed by seaweed. The
Fukuoka-based beauty industry company specializes in health foods and cosmetics. The
seaweed is farmed in Itoshima City, Fukuoka Pref and is used as an ingredient.
o  Discussions center on using "J Blue Credits" to certify CO2 absorption by seaweed.

Itoshima City and the Itoshima Fisheries Cooperative are also participating.


Cosmo Oil Marketing to test carbon credit trading service

(Company statement, Oct 22)
•  Cosmo Oil Marketing is testing “Cosmo Zero Carbon Credit” that uses the J-Credit scheme to
offset CO2 emissions from fuel oil consumption.
•  Cosmo Oil plans to launch the service in 2025 and will allow customers to offset emissions without
registering for J-Credit trading themselves.
• TAKEAWAY: Cosmo Oil's initiative is an attempt to open the carbon credit market to a wider range of

participants, such as smaller businesses and municipalities. In general, the market faces high costs and
complex regulations, discouraging smaller players.



Japan’s jet fuel shortage leads carriers to cancel flights

(Nikkei Asia, Oct 23)
•  Japan's airlines have a jet fuel shortage problem, leading to cancellation of flights and entire
routes. Narita airport has had about 60 flights canceled each week.
•  The issue stems from reduced oil refining and shipping capacity due to declining gasoline
demand. Only 19 refineries remain in Japan, half the number in 2000.
•  There are also problems with logistics. The consolidation of petroleum products distributors has
reduced the number of transport vehicles.
•  The govt seeks to improve logistics and asks airlines to post fuel needs in advance.

•  CONTEXT: Declining refinery capacity is directly related to the effort to transition away from fossil
fuels to clean energy. For example, the push to expand the public’s fleet of EVs has led to a
decrease in demand for petroleum products. In this context, the jet fuel scarcity is not surprising,
though certainly unintended.
• TAKEAWAY: The jet fuel shortage is impacting tourism. The number of international flights are still down 30%
compared to pre-pandemic levels. Meeting Japan’s goal of 60 million annual inbound visitors by 2030 will be

difficult if the jet fuel deficit isn’t solved. But the other major issue involved here is logistics. Moving the fuel
from refineries to airports and between terminals requires a large fleet of trucks. A shortage of truck drivers
and this year’s new restriction on overtime hours have strongly affected the fuel supply chain.

Japan’s Petroleum Association calls for promotion of SAF use by airlines
(Japan NRG, Oct 24)
o  The head of the Petroleum Association of Japan called for regulations to urge airline
companies to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

o  The existing policy requires oil wholesalers to supply a certain amount of SAF, but it does
not require airlines to use it.
o  Kito Shunichi, who is also the president of petroleum firm Idemitsu Kosan, said on Oct 24
that “Regulations and systems are needed to promote understanding among airlines and
(encourage) the use of SAF.”
o  He added that the cost of building SAF production facilities has been rising, and called

for more state support.


EU-Japan clean energy policy working group launches

(Government statement, Oct 25)
•  A new working group on clean energy industry policy comprising members from EU and Japan

EEX to launch electricity options from Q1 2025, add new contracts

](Japan NRG, Oct 23)
•  The EEX said it will roll out new derivatives contracts in Japan starting Q1. Option on electricity
prices, as well as daily futures contracts for the Kansai area, will be added to the offering.
•  The exchange is also looking at adding long-term duration contracts, for up to five or six years, to
cater to generators looking to hedge cash flows over the longer period.
•  The options contract price will be calculated as the average of electricity spot prices during the
delivery month (average price options). This will be available for both the Tokyo and Kansai area,
and up to nine months expiries.
•  The EEX will also switch its annual futures contracts from calendar year to fiscal year (starting April

1) to accommodate common practice in Japan. Fiscal year contracts will be available for both base
and peak loads, and for the Tokyo and Kansai areas.
•  Finally, the EEX plans to open an exchange order book for Japan power futures (between 4-6pm
Tokyo time) to pool liquidity with traders and brokers operating in EU electricity markets. Demo
testing of the new function starts in December.
CONTEXT: The EEX electricity futures market has seen rapid growth since launched about four

years ago. TOCOM also offers electricity futures trading, but EEX has a dominant market share.
• TAKEAWAY: Options have been something that a large number of power traders have asked for in Japan, and
such contracts have considerably bolstered trading volumes in other countries. In this sense, the news has
been well received by market participants. Almost as significant will be the opening of the order book to pool
liquidity with capital trading during European hours. This should continue to bolster overall volumes and
incentivize “integration” of Japanese and European electricity trading, if not from a price-setting perspective
then from an operational standpoint and in terms of capital allocation.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Citadel-owned Energy Grid says its new owner will help expand volumes
(Japan NRG, Oct 23)

o  Energy Grid, a Japanese power wholesaler acquired by U.S. hedge fund Citadel, will be
able to tap into its parent company’s capital strength to expand the scale of its trading
transactions and offer more opportunities to hedge long-term price fluctuations, said
Kinoshita Yohei, president of Energy Grid.
o  The firm currently has “flat” exposure in the power futures market, Kinoshita said.



ICE looks to enter the Japan’s electricity futures market

(Japan NRG, Oct 23)
•  The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), owner of the New York Stock Exchange, plans to enter the
Japan market to offer trading in electricity futures contracts.
•  Trading is due to start on Dec 9, subject to regulatory approval.

11



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The exchange described a 24-hour base and an (8am-8pm) peak load contract in each of the
Tokyo and Kansai areas. The financially settled contracts will trade in yen. Unit of trading is 1 MW;
the minimum price change will be ¥ 0.01/ kWh.
•  The trading in Japanese contracts will be operated by ICE’s Futures Europe Rulebook.
•  CONTEXT: Currently, the power futures market in Japan is split between Germany’s EEX, which

has the dominant volume share, and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, or TOCOM, which is a unit
of the Japan Exchange Group (JPX).
•  CONTEXT: According to EEX, as of September, the number of clients trading more than 100 GWh
per month on the exchange had increased to 25, which is 3.6 times that of a year earlier. The
number of clients trading more than 500 GWh has also increased from zero to nine.
• TAKEAWAY: This year’s power futures trading volumes will exceed those of last year by several times amid
growing interest in hedging risks and locking in future electricity prices against volatility in weather, politics,

and fuel costs. Still, ICE is one of the world’s biggest marketplace operators and its entrance to Japan has
caused a stir among market players. Yet, it starts about five years behind the EEX and TOCOM. Another U.S.-
based exchange, the CME, already tried to enter the Japanese futures market without gaining traction. Should
ICE attract a new pool of capital that’s currently not invested in Japanese power derivatives, then it will likely
do well, essentially replicating the approach of the EEX. Otherwise, it may need to battle with the EEX for
clients. While the market is growing rapidly, there are plenty of revenue opportunities for all exchanges.
Building a client base in Japanese power, however, is not so simple. Meanwhile, the existing players have

evolved their products and are adding new contracts, such as options. This is definitely an area to watch.



METI wants power retailers to take on greater responsibilities: Terazawa
(Japan NRG, Oct 23)
•  Recent policy discussions inside METI aim to increase the responsibility that power retailers have to

their customers – the end-users of electricity, said Terazawa Tatsuya, CEO of the Institute of Energy
Economics, Japan (IEEJ), during Power Week.
•  CONTEXT: METI is anxious to avoid a repeat of the 2022 situation when a sudden surge in prices
left a significant minority of power retailers unable to secure the necessary electricity volumes on
the wholesale market and then filed for bankruptcy or simply abandoned the sector altogether.
Around a fifth of firms with a power retailer license exited this business, which forced the major

power utilities to take on those customers as providers of last resort. The situation caused
confusion and concern among end-users, power suppliers and energy officials.
•  How METI will seek to increase the scrutiny on retailers is as yet undecided, but according to
Terazawa, who sits on several government energy committees, one solution could come through
encouraging retail firms to have a varied portfolio for their electricity procurement.
•  Retailers should avoid relying on the wholesale market for all of their volumes and instead aim to
ensure that a portion of their supply comes via long-term contracts, etc. Retailers should also

actively use the futures and other derivatives contracts to hedge their positions, Terazawa said.
• TAKEAWAY: To date, METI has issued over 700 power retail licenses amid a rush to increase competition in
the sector since the 2016 electricity market liberalization. METI somewhat regrets its fully open approach after
some retailers left consumers stranded. Today, acquiring a new license to retail electricity in Japan is said to be
increasingly difficult and some companies entering the market chose to buy existing license holders as a way
to cut through the bureaucracy. The upside from stronger regulation of retailers will mean that firms that

currently hold a license, but are largely dormant, will likely find it unattractive to maintain it. As a result, they
will either seek to sell out or cancel their permit. Either way, the quality of the remaining retailers should
improve and a greater percentage will be active.




Base load market prices rise in both East and West for second 2024 power auction
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 21)

Discussion on compulsory bidding in the balancing market
(Denki Shimbun, Oct 25)
•  OCCTO convened the Demand-Supply Adjustment (i.e. Balancing) Market Study Subcommittee,
chaired by Professor Yokoyama Akihiko of Tokyo University to discuss "institutional measures" that
would require specific businesses to submit bids to the balancing market.
•  The focus will be narrowed to day-ahead transactions to stimulate activity in correlation with the

spot market. The decision on whether to introduce new measures will also be based on a parallel
review of actions such as loosening bid requirements and price discipline.
•  Initially, the committee reviewed the scope of contracts covered, based on a survey conducted
among all 75 trading members, with 39 responding.
•  When asked why supply was challenging, the top response (from thermal operators) cited “output
reduction across multiple units.” Among pumped storage operators, the main reason was

“reservoir capacity limitations.”
•  Topics for future discussion include how to calculate cross-regional reserve margins and the timing
of startup decisions for power sources with lengthy activation times.

•  Tohoku Electric made its second application to the NRA for approval of the design and
construction plan at Onagawa NPP Unit 2. It relates to the Specific Severe Accident Response

Facility (SSARF).

16



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The SSARF serves to protect the reactor containment from damage in case of terrorist
threats. The facility must be built within five years of the main facility construction approval, thus by
Dec 22 2026.
•  CONTEXT: Tohoku Electric will restart the unit on Oct 29. The reactor is set to begin power
generation in early November and commercial operation in December.

• TAKEAWAY: Monitoring the situation at Onagawa NPP Unit 2 is important for two reasons. The first is it will
play a key role in meeting increased energy demand in the winter. The second is that it will be the first restart
of a boiling water reactor (BWR) in Japan since the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident. BWR reactors are still
assumed to be less safe simply because this was the type used at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP. There have been
numerous advances in BWR reactors since the models at Fukushima were installed. In any case, this will be an
important step for the nuclear industry.

Shell, Mitsubishi to launch Canada LNG by mid-2025
(Nikkei, Oct 25)
•  Shell and Mitsubishi Corp plan to start production at their “LNG Canada” project by mid-2025.

They said it’s now 95% complete.
•  Shell is also considering doubling the production capacity, and might invest as much as $5 billion
annually in upstream gas and oil development through 2030.
•  Production capacity will be about 14 mtpa. JERA, Tokyo Gas, and Toho Gas are expected to
import about 15% of the output.
•  Shell also plans to source LNG from a Mexico Pacific project on the country’s west coast if it

launches in 2029 as planned.
• TAKEAWAY: While LNG demand tightness is expected to ease in 2025-2027, a rebound is expected as more
Asian countries turn to the fuel. Japan, China and South Korea will be competitive markets for companies like
Shell or QatarEnergy. Shell's strategic location in Canada and Mexico avoids the Panama Canal, offering a
faster and cheaper route to East Asia than from the Middle East.




Qatar struggles to ink new LNG deals with Japan and South Korea due to competition
(Reuters, Oct 21)
•  Qatar is struggling to secure new LNG deals with key Asian buyers such as Japan and South Korea,
due in large part to competition from the U.S., UAE, and Oman.
•  These rivals offer more flexible, short-term contracts. Qatar continues to insist on the use of
destination clauses and long-term agreements, limiting buyer flexibility to resell cargoes.
•  CONTEXT: Japan's demand for LNG is declining, driven by nuclear restarts, renewables, and a

slowing economy. Thus, Qatar's market share in Japan has dropped.
• TAKEAWAY: While Qatar is expanding LNG production, only 48% of its future output has been contracted.
Thus, Qatar might find itself forced to be more active in the spot market. Some in the market also believe that
Qatar will start to offer more flexibility in its contracts as its new capacity under construction comes closer to
operating.

Hydrogen Project Rollout in Japan Waylaid by Choppy Politics and Cost

After years of planning, new hydrogen and ammonia projects in Japan were expected
to get the green light in 2024 with the rollout of state subsidies. Industry expectations
were high and potential exporters from Asia, the Middle East, North America and
Australia have been on high alert to sales opportunities.

Progress remains uneven, however. While the Diet passed the Hydrogen Society
Promotion Act in May, taking effect last week, on Oct 23, before the promised
November deadline, key details on when the application process for state subsidies
begins, and some other parameters, still remain unclear. According to ANRE, these
will take “a little longer.”

Example sheets in the application forms suggest that METI still envisages subsidies to
flow into the hydrogen and ammonia supply chains in the near future. People familiar
with the subsidy procedures, however, now admit that recent political upheaval in
Japan, and to a small extent the upcoming U.S. election, have put progress on pause.
It would be a major, positive surprise if even one subsidy is awarded this year.

Since Kishida’s August announcement not to seek reelection as head of the ruling
LDP, politics have taken priority over policy considerations in Tokyo. Ishiba won the
most crowded LDP leadership race in recent decades, only to face lukewarm
popularity soon after taking office. Ishiba immediately called for a general election to
cement his position, but early results show that the Oct 27 election massively weaken the
LDP’s control of the Diet.

As the next steps for Ishiba and his Cabinet are uncertain, and the U.S. presidential
vote due in a week, few see the METI minister signing off on any major hydrogen
developments in the immediate future.


Act in action
Switching to hydrogen or ammonia from fossil fuels is in most cases more expensive,
and demanding a green (i.e. renewables-powered) version of the former is especially
so. As such, the government vowed earlier in 2024 to offer a subsidy often referred to
as a Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme.

The CfD, already deployed in the UK and a few other nations, offers to pay buyers of
fuel the difference between the cost of a hydrocarbon-based product and a hydrogen
or ammonia alternative.

Japan’s subsidy program offers support for two use cases. One is to plug the price
gap between, say, the cost of securing coal to burn in a thermal power plant and that
of buying low-carbon ammonia. Japan’s definition of what qualifies as “low-carbon”
ammonia, hydrogen and synthetic fuels such as e-methane is spelled out in the
documents related to the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act.



20



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

In short, it allows for hydrogen to cause emissions of no more than 3.4 kg of CO2
equivalent in the making of one kilo of hydrogen. This carbon intensity measure is
applied on a “well to gate” basis, which means it includes the emissions from
upstream and transportation, but excludes some others, such as in the storage and
service segments.

The subsidy program is also aimed at covering part of the Front-End Engineering
Design (FEED) of infrastructure facilities that will transport and store low-carbon
hydrogen and its derivatives.

Both use cases essentially reward the Japan-based demand side players, covering
additional costs that they’ll incur from importing, storing, moving and utilizing low-
carbon hydrogen and ammonia.

The subsidies won’t be awarded directly to overseas manufacturers of hydrogen and
its derivatives (although domestic producers of the same can apply). However,
overseas producers would benefit from their Japanese importers securing the funds to
pay for the premium that hydrogen-based alternatives demand compared to
conventional fuels.

The subsidies are offered for as long as 15 years but can only apply for imports or
domestic production that will begin ammonia / hydrogen supply before or in 2030.


With the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act in force as of Oct 23, METI posted its initial
documents to explain the subsidy application procedure and offer examples of how to
do so.

How much will subsidies cover?
At the start of 2024, the government announced that ¥3 trillion would be set aside in
the budget to cover the CfD and related support measures for hydrogen. According
to METI comparisons, that’s significantly more than what other countries have offered
to hydrogen suppliers to date.

The ¥3 trillion, however, will barely cover 0.5 million tons of annual hydrogen
equivalent supply, according to ENEOS calculations. Tanaka Hideaki, the GM of the
hydrogen business department at the oil wholesaler, voiced concerns that this amount
is six times less than what the government sets as the country’s low-carbon hydrogen
demand goal for 2030.

By 2040, METI forecasts that Japan will be utilizing 12 million tons of hydrogen a year.
So, how would the current subsidy budget enable this when domestic demand at
present is at just 2 million tons and nearly all of that is gray hydrogen, asked Tanaka at
a recent industry event. In other words, it is made from fossil fuels without any carbon
capture and doesn’t qualify as “low-carbon”.

From the government viewpoint, ¥3 trillion is already a large amount and more than
ample to get things going, countered a representative of the Development Bank of
Japan. After all, the CfD and related measures seek to inject money into regions that
want to position themselves as hydrogen hubs. If these areas truly wish to achieve this
goal, rather than simply benefit from the latest available subsidy, then they and

21

associated local industries need to think how to create a commercially viable
infrastructure and trade around hydrogen, the state banker said. “State institutions
cannot fund all interested parties.”

State-owned resource company JOGMEC is in charge of administering the CfD and
related hydrogen subsidy scheme and is now evaluating 10 hydrogen hub / supply
chain proposals. Eight of those are tied to specific locations and three are near major
cities.

JOGMEC senior vice president Yamamoto Koji said at a hydrogen industry event last
month that “¥3 trillion is not enough but it’s relatively large compared to other
countries,” citing budget allocations from Germany, the UK, and Australia as at least
eight times smaller.

JOGMEC is open to supporting blue and other types of hydrogen, and sees CfD
funding starting “soon” and projects launching in 2030, according to Yamamoto.

Financiers of Japan’s hydrogen supply chains are more sanguine. A banker in charge
of hydrogen financing at the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)
explained that their team had reviewed more than 100 hydrogen or related projects in
the last two years, but despite signing 30+ MoUs, “we closed only one deal”. The
reason is that hydrogen prices are too expensive for most Japanese buyers to jump
into long-term offtake supply deals.


The DBJ banker said they may need to accept that some projects won’t secure offtake
for more than five years following launch because of the uncertainty around hydrogen
supply volumes and prices in the 2030s. The banker said there are other options aside
from CfD that hydrogen suppliers and buyers should consider, including LTDA power
capacity auctions.

Conclusion
Factors that should help to alleviate concern on the demand side will be the
introduction of real carbon pricing, according to an official from trading house
Marubeni, but this is not expected until at least 2026.

Meanwhile, firms involved in hydrogen hub projects are concerned about securing
licenses to operate amid public anxiety over hydrogen and ammonia safety issues.
Construction costs are also high due to rising interest rates and raw material prices,
which means that timing for a Final Investment Decision (FID) of local hydrogen
projects is becoming crucial.

“The government should raise awareness that going green will increase prices. People
should understand it and be motivated to accept higher prices,” said Ikushima Wataru
Marubeni’s GM for its new energy business development department.

At times of political upheaval, however, the government is less keen to trumpet higher
prices and announce big spending on energy subsidies. If there is even one subsidy
award announced before 2025, we should take it as a pleasant Christmas gift.

Building an Offshore Wind Workforce: Japan Struggles to Train Skilled Talent

This is the second article looking at measures to foster skills needed to advance the
expansion of wind power generation in Japan.

In the next five years, Japan’s preparedness for the expansion of offshore wind power
generation will be put to the test with a number of large-scale projects set to come
online that would account for an estimated 3-5 GW in capacity if built.

However, to realize the government’s clean energy goals for 2030 and beyond, the
offshore wind sector is in dire need of attracting tens of thousands of qualified and
motivated workers.

Recently, a growing number of private training centers have started offering programs
for established technical workers, raising expectations that wind power projects
already in the pipeline have a good chance of completion on time. But the lack of
structured university programs to prepare a permanent wind power workforce is
raising concerns about whether Japan is ready to build and maintain large-scale
offshore wind projects for decades to come.


Private training centers can only partly fill the void. Japan must step up its game in
terms of both fostering and securing top talent for a wide range of jobs, from
technological innovators to on-site wind installation and maintenance technicians, as
well as experts in industrial health, safety inspections, search and rescue operations,
as well as maritime and shipping.

Japan NRG takes a look at recent initiatives aimed at rectifying the current deficit of
essential skilled workers that could impede the growth of the nation’s wind energy
industry.

Where are the university programs for wind?
Japan has a total of 796 universities, and of these, 114 private and public universities
offer technology training courses that feature renewable energy generation as part of
their curricula. But what does this mean for the offshore wind industry?

University students currently enrolled in technological studies are concerned that
existing programs aren’t sufficiently relevant for their career in the sector. Several
students attending the recent Global Offshore Wind Summit in Sapporo City said
they’re worried that the curriculum doesn’t prepare them to gain employment in the
wind power industry.

To be fair, given that the industry is in its infancy and wind technology is still
developing, it’s not surprising that Japan’s universities have not had enough time to
adequately structure programs to foster all the skills that the wind power industry
currently needs.



23



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Nevertheless, to address the issue, several universities have set up a consortium that
aims to establish an educational framework that will upgrade existing curricula and
target students who might later want to find employment in the offshore wind
industry.

Among the consortium’s leading members are Nagasaki University, Akita University,
Akita Prefectural University, the University of Kitakyushu and Chiba University. These
institutions are in close vicinity to planned offshore wind projects, or in zones
designated by the government for possible future wind power systems development.
The group is working with major utilities such as JERA, TEPCO Renewable Power,
Kyuden Mirai Energy, and Chubu Electric, trading house Mitsubishi Corp and
academic and research institutions, as well as the non-governmental ship classification
society, Class NK.

Japan currently has ten so-called promotion zones designated as ready for offshore
wind project development. The government has selected developers for eight out of
the ten of those areas, with the remaining two expected to be announced by the end
of 2024. Other areas selected as suitable for wind farms – another nine promising
zones, and 11 preparation zones in the more preliminary stages – are concentrated
around coastal areas of Hokkaido, the Tohoku region and southernmost Kyushu
island. The list below does not include the three recently added preparation zones off
the coast of Wakayama and Akita prefectures.


















Source: METI

Looking to the UK and EU for inspiration
The consortium is drafting a scheme based on the UK's educational program called
the Industrial Doctoral Centre in Offshore Renewable Energy (IDCORE), which helps
students acquire technical skills and other transferable expertise. The group plans to
set up internships at existing offshore wind farms to help students gain practical real-
world skills, similarly to the IDCORE program.

The private sector is also joining forces in utilizing internships to foster new talent.
During the Global Offshore Wind Summit, an official from Denzai, a heavy lifting and

transportation firm, said his company plans to offer internships to help students get a
glimpse into a wind farm’s real working environment.

This is crucial because work on an offshore wind farm can be grueling, where workers
face a wide range of professional challenges and hazards that they wouldn't encounter
in land-based wind projects. From raging seas to moving heavy equipment that
doesn’t allow any margin for error, the offshore wind sector demands a category of
workers who are rugged and resilient in character, as well as proficient in their work.

The offshore wind industry will also have to engage transportation and other logistics
firms, as well as preparing staff how to act in emergencies, as well as rescue
operations. Towards a solution, the Japan Wind Power Association is collaborating
with international organizations such as Global Wind Organization, as well as firms
from EU countries with operational offshore wind farms, to grasp the industry’s
complex and novel employment needs.

One crucial step is compiling guidelines on skill sets for technical workers. So far,
JWPA in collaboration with GWO have issued guidelines only for entry level
technicians. The industry needs more detailed guidance to cover an advanced and a
broader range of skill sets.

As offshore wind power generation starts to take off, Japanese companies that are
slow to plan the skill set of their human resources in this field will later struggle to find
skilled professionals to fill key positions. What adds to the challenge is that Japanese
firms need to restructure their organizations to adjust to the current needs of the
market.


Most Japanese corporations have long relied on the lifetime-employment model
where staff commit to the company until retirement, while acquiring skills on the job.
This model, which contradicts employment practices in Western countries, has also
placed focus on collective responsibility, and has resulted in more expectations
placed on company loyalty over the advancement of skill sets that are needed in
emerging industries like the wind sector.

Traditional Japanese firms face difficulties in reforming their hiring systems to
introduce positions for highly skilled individuals that will be needed for large-scale
operations; these cadres will demand to be paid accordingly and have career
expectations that don’t naturally slot into the current job progression at such firms.

For now, most job openings in Japan lack a clear job description that would appeal to
people with expertise in specific areas, as they often correspond with the skills of job-
seekers.

Conclusion
Japan has little time to train and build a workforce. Work is now commencing on
offshore wind farms that are slated to be completed in 2030. The first generation of
such workers are going to have to take a crash course in order to meet that deadline.
Otherwise, Japan will need to rely largely on talent from outside of Japan, and while
this option seems sensible in the short term, it’s a band-aid solution that also assumes


25



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

overseas talent will not be tempted by offshore wind jobs elsewhere in Asia / around
the world.

Compounding the challenge is the government’s goal of as much as 45 GW of
offshore wind capacity by 2040. While that target seems far away, the fact remains
that installing such a massive amount of capacity is going to require a small army of
skilled workers. And those technicians need to be prepared years in advance.

Whatever progress Japan makes in offshore wind technologies, be it in fixed or
floating turbines, and in terms of perfecting project management, will count for little if
there are not enough people to install and operate the facilities. Policy and business
planners often zero in on the supply chain bottlenecks. This time they need to check
on the people.
