NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


ANRE starts discussions on implementing 7th Basic Energy Plan

(Government statement, June 2)
•  At the Basic Policy Subcommittee, ANRE discussed energy policy for 2040.
•  The MoE, MLIT, and MAFF also reported on progress of their initiatives.
•  Officials agreed that as global power demand grows, countries must deal with balancing energy
security, economic impact, and decarbonization.
•  The Govt will consider these global changes and proceed with implementing the policies outlined in
the 7th Basic Energy Plan.
•  CONTEXT: In February, the Cabinet approved the Plan and the Outlook for Energy Supply and Demand
in FY2040.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ANRE discusses renewable energy and grid development
(Government statement, June 3)
o  ANRE reviewed progress toward realizing goals for the 2030 energy mix, and outlined
policies to make renewable energy a main baseload source by 2040.
o  ANRE also proposed a mechanism to set operational capacity and margins for inter-regional
interconnection lines needed to resolve congestion in power grids.
o  Renewable energy growth uses “non-firm” connections that allow output control during
congestion. As inter-regional lines expand, local grid congestion might increase. This must
be managed by controlling power flows and capacity limits.
o  CONTEXT: As renewable energy use expands and power demand increases due to facilities like
data centers, the need for grid development will grow. To plan and carry out this efficiently,
institutional measures are needed, including more efficient financing, as stated in the 7th Basic
Energy Plan.



EGC launches oversight group for ‘other market revenue’ in LTDA scheme
(Government statement, May 30)
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) has launched a new group to
monitor so-called ‘other market revenues’ under the Long-Term Decarbonized Power Sources
Auction (LTDA) scheme.
•  Under the LTDA framework, winning bidders must return to OCCTO around 90% of revenues
earned from markets outside the LTDA mechanism (e.g. wholesale power sales or balancing

markets).
•  To ensure fair implementation, EGC will scrutinize how much revenue operators declare from these
additional sources, helping prevent underreporting and excess public subsidy.
•  CONTEXT: The LTDA aims to support only new power generation investments, with bids based on fixed
costs. To simplify and prevent inflated bids, expected revenues from other markets are set to zero at the
auction stage. However, once projects begin operating, they can earn substantial additional revenues. To
avoid overcompensating operators while still preserving their incentive to operate efficiently, a clawback
mechanism returns a portion of these ‘extra’ revenues to the system—hence the need for EGC
monitoring.

OCCTO discusses long-term outlook for cross-regional grid

(Agency statement, May 30)
•  OCCTO began discussing the long-term outlook for cross-regional grid development.
•  In preparation for the 3rd Master Plan for cross-regional grid systems, OCCTO must decide whether
to revise the premises and scenarios in the current long-term outlook.
•  By year’s end, the unit cost of standard power transmission and transformation equipment will be
recalculated to account for rising labor costs and inflation.
•  Regarding renewal of existing interconnection lines, OCCTO will evaluate them on a case-by-case
basis. It won’t assume the same capacity as before.
•  CONTEXT: Current long-term policy for the cross-regional grid outlines potential enhancement plans for
each possible scenario, based on expected trends and a cost-benefit evaluation. By year’s end, OCCTO
will decide whether changes to the approach and scenarios are needed, and then in 2026, it will assess
how those impact long-term outlook.



OCCTO discusses out-of-market balancing capacity deduction in EPRX
(Agency statement, June 3)
•  OCCTO discussed deduction of out-of-market balancing capacity as a measure against insufficient
bids in the EPRX (Electric Power Reserve Exchange).
•  After investigating factors for out-of-market balancing capacity related to thermal power and
pumped-storage, OCCTO concluded that a certain volume can be deducted from the EPRX FY2025
procurement requirements.
•  Although the deduction volume varies by area and product, total procurement across the nine areas
could be reduced by 20% to 70%.
•  Deductions will be applied gradually and continue until March 2026.
•  CONTEXT: OCCTO already announced its policy to deduct out-of-market balancing capacity from the
required amount in the balancing market, EPRX. However, the specifics and effective date weren’t
discussed previously.

Kansai Electric achieves 30% hydrogen co-firing at Himeji power plant
(Company statement, June 6)
•  Kansai Electric reached the target hydrogen co-firing ratio (on a volume basis) of 30% as part of a
fuel blending demo at the natural gas-fired Himeji No. 2 Thermal Power Plant, Hyogo Pref.
•  CONTEXT: This is Japan’s first hydrogen co-firing power generation using a commercial-scale gas
turbine.
•  The demo started in April with the blending ratio increasing over time.
•  Part of the power generated is supplied to the Osaka-Kansai Expo.
• TAKEAWAY: While JERA has focused its Japan co-firing efforts on ammonia fuel and coal-fired power plants,
Kansai Electric has been tasked by NEDO to demonstrate the potential for hydrogen and natural gas blending.
The hydrogen co-firing rate was initially set at 10%, which is the level at which the LTDA mechanism, for
example, would accept subsidy applications. However, Kansai Electric’s NEDO-mandated goal was to test the

30% benchmark with the idea that by mid-century gas-fired plants like Himeji could switch entirely to clean-
burning hydrogen.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
INPEX to test hydrogen and ammonia production using gas as feedstock
(Company statement, June 6)
o  INPEX began a demo test (in Kashiwazaki City, Niigata Pref) that produces ‘blue’ hydrogen
and ammonia. The facility uses natural gas from INPEX's nearby gas fields.
o  The CO2 emitted during production will be injected into previously depleted gas reservoirs
in the Hirai District of the HigashiKashiwazaki Gas Field using CCUS technology.
o  The hydrogen will be used for local power generation; some will be processed into
ammonia thanks to catalysts by Japanese startup BHB Tsubame and supplied to local firms.
o  After the trial, full-scale hydrogen production is set to begin in autumn, at about 700 tons
per year.

NEWS:    SOLAR     AND   BATTERIES


RTS says Japan must roll out 7 GW of solar power annually by 2030

(Organization statement, May 28)
•  RTS Corp said that annual solar installation capacity through 2030 and 2040 must grow
significantly in order to meet GX goals and GHG reduction targets.
•  CONTEXT: RTS is a Japan-based research and consulting firm specializing in solar PV and renewables.
•  Japan must roll out 5-7 GW of solar power capacity per year by 2030, aiming to reach between 103
GW (AC) and 117.6 GW (AC).
•  For 2040, the target is between 203 GW (AC) and 280 GW (AC); the annual rollout needs to be 10-
16 GW (AC) per year from 2030 onwards.
•  The firm also said about 460,000 non-residential solar power installations, totaling around 29 GW,
will reach the end of their FIT period between FY2032 and FY2036.
•  As of Dec 2024, total battery grid applications and connections were:
o  95 GW in projects under consideration;
o  8 GW with confirmed connection contracts;

NEWS:    WIND    POWER      AND   OTHER     RENEWABLES



METI and MLIT discuss support for offshore wind projects

(Government statement, June 3)
•  On June 3, METI and MLIT discussed offshore wind development taking into account feedback from
public comments on the revised public auction guidelines.
•  A major focus was the proposal to allow Round 1 auction projects (initially under the FIT) to shift to
the FIP, which faced strong opposition.
•  CONTEXT: Mitsubishi, winner of three Round 1 fixed-bottom projects, requested pricing scheme
revisions due to inflation and yen depreciation.
•  In the wake of Mitsubishi’s decision to halt projects in the pipeline, METI has been working on
offshore wind support measures, including the FIP transition and capacity market participation for
zero-premium projects.
•  However, some stakeholders criticized the FIP shift as undermining trust, noting past public
documents explicitly assumed FIT-based implementation.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  METI received feedback from 14 offshore wind developers and two industry associations. Some
suggested a re-tendering process or allowing runner-up bidders a chance if original winners can't
proceed.
•  Some argued that if FIP is allowed, it should be under zero-premium terms to maintain fairness. But
METI also faced criticism that price adjustment mechanisms don’t support zero-premium projects
effectively.
•  Many requested support for offtakers of offshore wind power to improve market viability.
• TAKEAWAY: Industry players anticipate that METI will need to offer enhanced support to help developers
accelerate projects, warning that without such intervention, delays could trigger a cascading impact on other
firms across the supply chain.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Murakami-Tainai offshore wind farm sees delays, but keeps 2029 launch
(Nikkei, June 3)
o  Work is delayed on an 180 MW offshore wind farm near Murakami and Tainai in Niigata
Pref that’s led by Mitsui & Co, Osaka Gas, and RWE’s Japan unit.
o  Work on onshore electrical facilities is taking longer than expected as contractor
negotiations slowed, pushing back some work originally set for April to October. However,
the target operation date of June 2029 remains unchanged.
o  CONTEXT: Similar delays are affecting other projects, such as the Mitsubishi-led offshore wind
plan off Choshi, Chiba, due to rising material and construction costs.
• TAKEAWAY: Delays plaguing Mitsubishi-led projects from Round 1 are rippling through the industry, impacting
port access and disrupting supply chains critical to Round 2 and Round 3 projects. As Mitsubishi continues to

reassess its stalled developments, frustration is mounting among developers and stakeholders, who increasingly
urge the govt to step in and provide support to keep the broader pipeline on track.



Japan to permit building offshore wind farms in the EEZ
(Government statement, June 3)
•  The House of Representatives in the Diet passed a revised version of the Renewable Energy Sea Area
Utilization Act, allowing offshore wind power facilities in the Exclusive Economic Zone.
•  CONTEXT: The EEZ extends up to 200 nautical miles (around 370 km) from the coast, and gives
countries special economic rights.
•  The govt can now designate suitable zones within the EEZ as areas open for development.

•  The change aims to accelerate expansion of offshore wind power; work in the EEZ is seen as more
feasible since permitting is less of a problem due to fewer chances of conflict with other
stakeholders.
•  CONTEXT: While fixed-bottom turbines are common in shallower territorial waters (22 km from the
coast), floating wind turbines will become the main option in deeper EEZ waters.
• TAKEAWAY: The news has been well received by industry players, who view the revision as a necessary step
toward unlocking Japan’s vast offshore wind potential. The move aligns with the Basic Energy Plan approved by
the Cabinet in February, which sets a target of raising wind power’s share in the energy mix from the current 1%
to 4–8% by FY2040. The EEZ policy revision creates new opportunities, particularly for floating offshore wind.
However, given that floating tech in Japan is still in the demo phase, and commercial projects could take up to a
decade to come online, the govt must provide sustained policy support, as well as foster investment and
technological advancement.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  A Task Force will discuss technical readiness, business models, site selection, and regulatory
frameworks.
•  Led by the Cabinet Office, the task force will include industry experts, researchers, and govt
observers (MEXT, METI, and the NRA). Key focus areas include prototype reactors, pilot plants,
financing, and international collaboration.
•  CONTEXT: Recently, nuclear fusion startup EX-Fusion raised ¥2.6 billion from VC firms, boosting
valuation to between ¥12 billion and ¥16 billion. The firm wants to prove 100-watt power generation
by 2030 and achieve commercialization around 2040. Govt subsidies are expected to help offset the
¥400 billion cost of building a commercial reactor.



Japan implements GX Decarbonization Act, NPPs can operate for over 60 years

(Nikkei, June 6)
•  Japan has now implemented the GX Decarbonization Act, which allows nuclear power plants to
operate beyond 60 years. It was originally passed in May 2023.
•  The legislation update resulted in amendments to five related laws, including the Electricity
Business Act and the Reactor Regulation Act. It permits extending the 60-year operation period by
excluding the time that NPPs had to shut down due to safety reviews or court rulings.
•  CONTEXT: The rules that reactors operating beyond 30 years must also submit a Long-Term Facility
Management Plan every 10 years still apply. They relate to equipment degradation and maintenance
strategies.



Tokyo Court overturns ruling that TEPCO execs must pay damages over Fukushima

(NHK, June 6)
•  The Tokyo High Court overturned a ruling that had ordered four former TEPCO execs to pay ¥13
trillion in damages over the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011.
•  The court ruled that the execs couldn’t have foreseen the massive tsunami before the 2011
earthquake, and thus were not liable. This decision nullifies the Tokyo District Court’s 2022 ruling
that held them responsible.
•  A shareholder lawsuit argued that a 2002 govt earthquake report made the tsunami risk foreseeable.
TEPCO conducted its own estimate in 2008 suggesting a 15.7-meter wave was possible. The
plaintiffs claimed the execs failed to act and install protective systems.
•  Yet, the appeals court found that the 2002 report did not have enough credibility to compel reactor
shutdowns or take countermeasures. The judge said it was "understandable" the execs didn’t feel a
strong sense of urgency at the time.
•  Still, the court noted that standards of responsibility for company directors on nuclear accidents
should be reviewed.
•  The plaintiffs intend to appeal to the Supreme Court.



Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP faces delay in restart, public hearing to continue

(Government statement, May 30)
•  The planned summer restart of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP is now unlikely. Niigata Pref said public
hearings to gather residents’ opinions will continue through Aug 31.

11



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: The extended timeline means that Governor Hanazumi will not need to make any decisions on the
restart until later on in Sept or even after. Once gaining consent, TEPCO has said that Unit 7 would need two
months from restart approval to full operation. Unit 7 was the initial target for the first reactor restart at the
NPP. It already has fuel loaded and its technical restart preparations are complete. But, despite TEPCO's initial
focus on Unit 7, the utility is now likely to switch attention to Unit 6, which should begin fuel loading on June
10. Under current anti-terrorism regulations, Unit 7 is only allowed to operate until Oct 13. Unit 6 has approval
to operate until Sept 2029.

incident in May.



Fire occurs at Tokai No.2, the 11th in three years
(NHK, May 30)
•  On May 30, a small fire occurred at the Tokai No. 2 NPP in Tokai Village, Ibaraki Pref. It began from
a cable connected to equipment during welding work in the reactor building's basement.
•  CONTEXT: A fire also occurred in the central control room in February. There were 11 similar incidents
in the past three years; nine have happened since 2023.
• TAKEAWAY: Tokai No. 2 is a story of aging infrastructure, regulatory friction, and eroding public trust. It got
restart approval in 2018 and was included in the LTDA, but remains idle due to legal setbacks, construction
delays, and safety concerns. The latter include these repeated fire incidents. This latest fire is minor, but for a

nuclear-skeptic public it could be a signal of the reactor’s operational fragility.

Australia extends operations of Woodside’s North West Shelf
(Reuters, May 28)
•  Australia approved Woodside Energy’s request to extend operations at its North West Shelf LNG
facility until 2070. This avoids the project's shutdown in 2030. The decision concludes a six-year
process marked by delays and environmental opposition, and issues related to protecting ancient
cultural heritage.
•  Govt officials set conditions on air emissions to protect local cultural heritage. Woodside must
respond within 10 days to complete the approval.
•  CONTEXT: Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) owns a 16.6% stake in the project; it’s evenly owned by
Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co. In December, Woodside upped its stake in North West Shelf to 50% by
acquiring Chevron’s share.
• TAKEAWAY: The extension is a much-needed boost for Woodside and all of Australia’s natural gas sector. In
recent years, there’s been sinking investor confidence in Australia’s gas sector due to uncertainties caused by
efforts to abruptly end activity in the country’s fossil fuel sector. A recent report revealed that 95% of gas
company CEOs see Australia as less attractive for investment than five years ago. With this decision, Woodside
can develop new gas fields, such as the offshore Browse project.




METI unveils policy for resource development in fossil fuel sector
(Government statement, June 6)
•  The govt aims to expand financial support via JOGMEC’s risk-sharing tools, to enhance LNG
security. It also aims to boost storage infrastructure and establish cargo swap arrangements.
•  Another goal is to diversify fossil fuel supply chains, such as maintaining long-term oil and gas
contracts with partners in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. This also applies to coal contracts.
•  The govt plans to expand offshore exploration in regions like Hokkaido, considering extending tax
incentives like depletion allowance for mining activities.
•  There are also initiatives such as the Asia Transition Finance framework and the Energy Career
Academy to support energy transitions in emerging economies and train energy professionals.




Japan, Taiwan, South Korea attend briefing on Alaska LNG

•  The govt will review applications for businesses interested in CCS exploratory drilling in the
Tomakomai area.
•  Once approved, the chosen companies will begin test drilling to confirm the storage capacity of the
underground reservoirs.
•  The goal is to establish Tomakomai as a key hub for Japan’s CCS infrastructure.
•  CONTEXT: The area covers around 96 km2. In 2016–2019 a demo project stored 300,000 tons of CO2
in the same site. Nearby power plants and refineries proposed a large-scale CCS project. It aims to
sequester 2 Mt of CO2 a year.




Govt talks on EU-CBAM key issues and Japan’s response
(Government statement, May 30)
•  The govt discussed the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). There are three major
challenges for Japanese exporters:
o  CO2 emission calculations,
o  Carbon price deductions, and
o  Third-party verification requirements.
•  The EU proposed simplifications, including exemptions for SMEs (importers under 50 tons/ year). It
allows default carbon price values when actual data is unavailable. Still concerns remain,
particularly around verification rules.
•  CONTEXT: The EU currently restricts certification to European-accredited bodies, which increases costs
for Japanese firms.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is advocating for mutual recognition of verification bodies, like the UK's approach.
Additionally, supply chain complexities highlight the need for standardized reporting formats. While the EU’s
simplified rules offer some relief, the Japan side wants further flexibility.

Intercontinental Power Links: A Feasible but Complex
Path to Energy Resilience

The recent blackout that swept the Iberian Peninsula and parts of France has brought
renewed attention to the risks and rewards of interconnected power grids. While some
blamed the scale of European interconnections for the April 28 outage, the broader
takeaway is more nuanced: properly managed interconnectors may be critical to
resilience.
That message resonates in Japan, where energy experts have long debated the merits of
regional interconnection. Japan remains an energy island, with no electrical links to
neighboring countries. But with extreme weather events increasing in frequency and the
energy transition gaining ground, the idea of linking Japan’s grid to one of its neighbors
is again under consideration.

A proposed Japan–Korea subsea power cable would span 220 kilometers across a
relatively manageable seabed. Using HVDC (high-voltage direct current) technology, the
cable would allow the two countries to trade electricity without directly syncing their
grids. That means each grid stays independent, but they can still buy and sell power
when desired.
In a scenario similar to the one on the Iberian Peninsula, the Japan–Korea
interconnection would provide a critical safety net. A 2 GW HVDC link — the typical
scale — could allow one country to support the other with backup electricity during a
major grid failure.

While it won’t replace total demand, it could help stabilize critical infrastructure,
support black-start operations, and buy time for domestic systems to recover in case of
an emergency. In an era of frequent climate-related disruptions, that kind of mutual
resilience is crucial.
Practicality of multilateral connection
In 2022, a group of energy firms founded Japan Interconnector (JI) to develop subsea
power cables projects – aptly known as interconnectors – in the Asia Pacific region. The
first effort, the EEL Project, will be an interconnector from Japan’s Kyushu island to
South Korea’s Busan City, a distance of 220 km. Another connection is also being
considered between Pohang in South Korea and Matsue City, Shimane Prefecture in
Japan.

Given the limited experience of subsea cables in Asia, JI is partnering with the UK’s
Frontier Power, which developed NeuConnect, a 725 km interconnector between the UK
and Germany, (1.4 GW capacity). Shizen Energy is the lead investor in a pre-seed
funding round for the Japan–Korea Interconnector project.
JI is also working on subsea cable projects around Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, such as
the Taiwan Undersea Network Alliance (TUNA), spanning 1,200 km between Kyushu,
Okinawa and Taiwan. Last year, Taiwan began deliberating on a plan to import
electricity from Japan and the Philippines, modelled on Singapore’s regional
interconnector program.

Taiwan is also exploring a broader regional grid initiative, specifically the proposed
Japan-Taiwan-Philippines HVDC interconnector, which, if realized, would foster
17

multilateral electricity trade, spur renewables development and enhance energy
resilience in APAC.

Direction of grid improvements
Japan has already shown strong interest in international interconnection projects, with
companies contributing to initiatives in Europe and Asia through technical cooperation,
feasibility studies, and even infrastructure development, such as the Belgium–UK link.
Also, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation provided significant financing for the
UK–Germany project, with Japan’s KEPCO and TEPCO as investors.
This involvement highlights Japan’s ability to support large-scale cross-border energy
infrastructure, both financially and technically, while also reflecting its broader strategic
commitment to regional and global energy connectivity.

Proponents of bilateral interconnector projects stress that with the progress in domestic
grid improvements, the technical tools for cross-border interconnections in Japan are
also already in place. Earlier this year, OCCTO picked winners for a tender to build a
2GW, 800 km HVDC subsea interconnector between Hokkaido and Honshu to link the
two islands via a line along the bottom of the Sea of Japan. Completion is slated for the
early 2030s.
Advocates for the Japan-Korea link point to global norms like the EU’s 15%
interconnection target, noting that Japan is an outlier in use of such technology to
improve energy resilience. The currently proposed bilateral and regional interconnectors
from Japan – by excluding China – also avoid geopolitically sensitive issues that sank
earlier efforts.

But is Japan’s government ready to embrace interconnection options?

For now, Japan is focused on strengthening power grid resilience via domestic, regional
strategies, according to the latest version of the Basic Energy Plan. The government is
advancing microgrids to help alleviate grid congestion in vulnerable regions. While these
enhance local resilience and energy autonomy, they can’t resolve structural grid
vulnerabilities or replace the need for interregional transmission upgrades.
Proponents of interregional connections, such as the Japan–Korea power cable, argue
that the economics are strong, with power price spreads driven by differences in
generation mix, demand, or weather patterns. Also, though both countries share the
same time zone, there remains substantial potential for electricity trading (arbitrage)
due to structural differences.

Critics, however, often raise energy security concerns in a global environment where
governments seek to onshore critical industries. But under the proposed plan, each
country would control its own converter station and could disconnect the link
unilaterally at any time.
Pan-Asia vision and geopolitical concerns
Despite the advantages, METI remains wary of interconnection proposals, especially
after earlier projects like the Asia Super Grid — which included China and Mongolia —
became politically sensitive. That idea was first publicly proposed in 2011, shortly after
the Fukushima nuclear disaster, by Son Masayoshi, the founder and CEO of SoftBank
Group.

The plan emerged as part of Son’s broader initiative to shift Japan away from nuclear
power and toward renewables, especially solar and wind power. The vision was not only

18



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

technological but also geopolitical — a bold call for regional energy cooperation across
Asia.

The idea gained traction through the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, with the aim
to source wind power from Mongolia’s Gobi Desert and transmit it via HVDC lines to
Japan, South Korea, and China. An MoU was signed in 2016 by SoftBank, Korean utility
KEPCO (unrelated to Japan’s utility), State Grid Corp of China, and Russia’s power grid
company Rosseti.
Feasibility studies were formally launched, but in 2017–2019 progress stalled due to
geopolitical concerns, especially over China’s involvement. Regulatory hurdles and
Japan’s domestic focus on grid upgrades and energy self-sufficiency were other
obstacles.

That effort has faded, and South Korea’s KEPCO disbanded its interconnection team. But
discussions around a Japan–Korea bilateral interconnector have continued
independently, often framed to exclude China for political and strategic reasons.
Moving forward with bilateral plan
JI says its vision is welcomed by Japan’s business community, and sources familiar with
the project confirm that talks with METI continue behind the scenes but the ministry
remains sceptical due to political turmoil in South Korea. Yet, that country’s utility,
KEPCO, remains interested.

On June 4, Prime Minister Ishiba expressed hope for a stable improvement in ties with
South Korea under new President Lee Jae Myung, saying the two countries should
partner in tackling global challenges.

Relations between Japan and South Korea improved under Lee's predecessor Yoon Suk
Yeol after a period of difficulty over issues related to wartime history. But with Lee,
Japan could be back to square one, given his nationalist stance on Japan's 1910-1945
colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.
Japan also worries that pursuing a connection with Taiwan might trigger a reaction
from China. Yet, the international link between Japan and one of its neighbors could
serve as a blueprint for future regional collaboration in Northeast Asia, paving the way
for more flexible, resilient, and climate-aligned electricity systems.

As extreme weather and shifting geopolitical dynamics test national energy strategies,
interconnection may prove not just beneficial but necessary. Success of the Japanese-
Korean project will depend not only on engineering and market logic, but on sustained
intergovernmental cooperation and a credible financing pathway.

Hydrogen Dreams, Fiscal Reality: Comparing the Main
State Subsidy Mechanisms

Japan has big dreams for hydrogen. By 2050, it wants to use 20 million tons of the
clean-burning gas each year – more than any other country today. The government sees
hydrogen not just as a decarbonization tool for heavy industry and shipping, but as a
pillar of national energy security and a balancing element for variable renewables. Yet
turning this vision into reality is proving expensive, and slow.
METI’s 2030 price target for hydrogen is ¥30 per normal cubic meter (Nm³), or roughly
$2.40 per kilogram. But real-world costs remain stubbornly high. Retail prices at
hydrogen stations are still around ¥100/ Nm³, which translates as closer to $8/ kg. And
some demonstration project bids – such as Tokyo’s green hydrogen auction – have come
in at over ¥300/ Nm³.

The scale of the gap is sobering. In order to hit its 2030 benchmarks, Japan must find
ways to cut hydrogen costs and increase annual supply by at least one million tons. It
also needs to support the take-up of hydrogen by hard-to-abate manufacturing without
ignoring interest in the fuel from the power sector, as well as possible future demand
from transport.
That’s where subsidy schemes come in. So far, two main programs have emerged to help
bridge the costs and stimulate demand: the Contract for Difference (CfD) and the Long-
Term Decarbonized Power Sources Auction (LTDA). The former subsidizes the
difference between hydrogen’s production cost and fossil fuel benchmarks. The LTDA,
meanwhile, incentivizes utilities to use hydrogen and ammonia by guaranteeing fixed-
price contracts.

The devil, however, lies in the details. Both schemes carry uncertainties and restrictions.
Japan NRG takes a look at the specifics.

Hydrogen price in CfD
Background: The first CfD tender opened applications at the end of last year and accepted
them until the end of March 2025. METI is making the initial selection before passing the
administration of the subsidies to JOGMEC. The majority of applications are focused on
hydrogen and ammonia, rather than synthetic fuels, with imports making up the bulk of
the offered volumes. A decision on the winners is expected later this year. After that, METI is
due to consider whether to host a second CfD round. As much as ¥3 trillion in subsidies has
been made available for winners of the initial round.
The CfD program aims to address one of the most significant barriers to hydrogen
commercialization: the cost disparity between low-carbon hydrogen and traditional
fossil fuels such as LNG or coal. This program subsidizes the difference, or price gap,
between the actual cost of producing and delivering low-carbon hydrogen and a
reference fossil fuel price.
State support reduces financial risks for hydrogen producers and suppliers, encouraging
investment in production technologies like renewable-powered electrolysis and natural
gas reforming with carbon capture, as well as in logistics infrastructure and storage.

Once approved, CfD winners will receive support for 15 years, provided they report costs
and volumes transparently. After the support ends, they are contractually obliged to
keep supplying fuel on commercial terms for at least another 10 years – an attempt to
build a self-sustaining market.
The formula used to determine the subsidy takes into account capital expenditures
(CAPEX), operating costs (OPEX), fuel inputs, inflation indexing, and financing costs.
The reference price is set to reflect the market-competitive level at which hydrogen
could be traded in Japan.

Despite the formula’s complexity, METI does not publish reference values or caps,
making it difficult for investors to assess likely outcomes. Still, the CfD is expected to be
the primary tool for scaling supply-side investment over the next several years.

[Standard Price] = α1 × A1 + ( α2 × A2 + B1 × (less than 110%) + B2 + C ) / [Total Supply]
• α1: Coefficient considering manufacturing efficiency, etc
• A1: Raw material prices, etc
• α2: Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment
• A2: Costs necessary for the continuous supply of hydrogen, etc., after the supply
begins
• B1: Construction cost for manufacturing, transportation, carrier conversion, and
CCS, etc, necessary for the supply of hydrogen, etc
• B2: Costs required before starting operation
• C: Funding costs, profits, etc
• Total Supply: Total amount supplied during the support period
Notes: When importing hydrogen for supply, fuel costs, charter fees, and overseas
shipbuilding costs needed for overseas transportation are also included.
Hydrogen price in LTDA
The LTDA tackles hydrogen from the demand side – specifically, its use in power
generation. It provides long-term fixed-price contracts, typically for 20 years, to
generators of low-carbon electricity. Projects bid for the minimum premium they need
above expected wholesale power prices to make their projects viable.
While originally focused on energy storage and thermal power retrofits, the LTDA is
expanding to include hydrogen and ammonia-fired power plants. Unlike the CfD,
however, it does not subsidize hydrogen production. Instead, hydrogen fuel costs are
rolled into the total bid price. This forces bidders to optimize their hydrogen sourcing
strategies to stay competitive.

Therefore, the financial viability of these projects depends on the competitiveness of
hydrogen costs relative to other low-carbon power generation technologies and
wholesale electricity prices. This mechanism creates an effective demand signal for
hydrogen in the power sector, motivating suppliers to reduce costs and enabling
hydrogen-fired power plants to succeed in the auction.
The LTDA generally sets maximum bid prices by power source type, but for hydrogen
and ammonia, significant relaxation of these limits is under consideration starting from
the third auction of FY2025. Variable costs such as fuel expenses will also be allowed to
be included in the bid price, not limited to fixed costs.

The maximum price will be determined by adding domestic fixed costs to fuel costs,
based on the most recent govt power generation cost estimates (from February 2025).
The fuel costs will be calculated as follows: The price difference between the total fuel
costs (including both fixed and variable components) and the fuel costs for LNG and
coal. It is assumed that the capacity is operated at a run rate of at least 40%.

Comparison
The CfD and LTDA target different stages of the hydrogen value chain. The CfD is a
supply-side mechanism designed to stimulate hydrogen production and infrastructure. It
offers more direct price transparency and cost support for hydrogen production.
The LTDA, by contrast, is a demand-side tool to pull hydrogen into the power sector.
It emphasizes market-driven competition to secure decarbonized power supply, where
hydrogen cost competitiveness becomes one factor among others in determining project
viability.
Together, they aim to create a functioning market, but the programs face similar
challenges. These include reducing hydrogen costs through tech innovation and
economies of scale, establishing robust international hydrogen trade frameworks, and
ensuring accurate carbon accounting to certify the fuels as low-carbon.

Conclusion
Japan has built an ambitious policy framework to promote hydrogen – one of the few
countries to do so. The CfD program offers crucial early-stage support to bring down
hydrogen prices and scale supply chains. The LTDA, by contrast, ensures demand by
integrating hydrogen into the power sector through predictable long-term contracts.
The schemes are complementary, but only if funding holds up and program rules remain
stable. As METI raises cap prices and expands LTDA eligibility, developers may shift
their focus from the CfD to power generation projects, where revenue is more visible
and fuel costs can be hedged.

METI’s banking on suppliers to cut costs by about ¥70/ Nm³ through CAPEX and OPEX
while also delivering at least one million tons of hydrogen into Japan by 2030 is highly
ambitious to say the least. Many market players will be focusing on the level of carbon
pricing that Japan will introduce in the coming years to balance the price gap between
clean and fossil fuels.
Overall, the government needs to ensure that both of its subsidy mechanisms remain
attractive and their price supports are realistic to ensure that hydrogen volumes start

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / Natural gas
PM Albanese reaffirmed support for natural gas extraction through at least 2070, saying it’s
needed to support the energy transition. Environmentalists pledge to fight him.
China / Coal power
In Q1, China approved 11.3 GW of new coal power capacity, said Greenpeace East Asia; in all
of 2024, China had a 41.5% decline in new coal approvals, reaching 62.24 GW.

China / Ethane imports
The U.S. won't give a license to Enterprise Products (based in Houston) for three
ethane cargoes heading to China.

China / Natural gas
The West-to-East Gas Pipeline has delivered a total of 550 bcm of gas to the Yangtze River
Delta region, boosting development. There are plans to extend the project.
China / Pumped storage
Total installed pumped storage capacity has risen to more than 58 GW, and China ranks first
in the world for nine consecutive years.

India / Renewable energy
Renewable energy’s share in total installed power capacity rose to 49% in April 2025, up from
32% in 2014, said the Union Power Minister.

India / Pumped storage
THDC India launched the first 250 MW of the 1 GW Variable Speed Pumped Storage Plant, the
country’s first. It is located in Tehri, Uttarakhand.
Laos/ Hydropower
Hydropower capacity is projected to reach 16 GW in 2035, with a compound annual growth
rate of 4.8% from 2024 to 2035, reported GlobalData.

Rare earths
The EU is pressing China to ease restrictions on exports of rare earths due to an “alarming
situation” for the car industry, with production lines in danger of shutting down.

Singapore / Interconnections
Long reliant on gas, Singapore wants to develop regional interconnections, primarily via subsea
cables, to link national grids and enable cross-border electricity trade.
