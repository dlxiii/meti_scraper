better than the previous Hitachi Zosen model. It can also operate at temperatures ranging from
100 degrees to minus 40 degrees Celsius.
•  The Co. will begin small-scale production of the prototype and in the meantime seek to double the

current capacity by 2025, as well as to explore commercialization options.
•  CONTEXT: Hitachi Zosen produces solid electrolytes without use of sealant or solvent. This
improves the battery’s electrical resistance and lowers risk of inflammation. The Co. has already
agreed with Japan’s space program to test its batteries in orbit.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Marubeni invests in startup offering super-fast battery alternative
(Nikkei, March 4)

o  Marubeni trading house has invested in an Estonian startup, Skeleton Technologies,
which is working on ultra-capacitors. These are fast-charging energy storage devices that
perform about 100 times better than lithium-ion batteries.
o  Marubeni will be the sales agent for Skeleton’s products in Japan and the rest of Asia.

Toyota develops modular fuel cell system for third-party use

(New Energy Business News, March 5)
•  Toyota has developed a new modular fuel cell system for release as early as spring. The system
packages air and hydrogen services, cooling, power control, and other services into a single
compact unit.
•  The target audience will be operators of trains, ships, trucks and buses, as well as power
companies. Toyota will provide the support of experienced engineers to determine the optimal

layout for each application.
•  The system is available in both vertical and horizontal configurations, and in 60 kW and 80 kW
variants, enabling it to be integrated into a wide range of vehicles. With a supply voltage of 400 to
750 V, the unit is compatible with existing electric equipment.
• TAKEAWAY: Toyota is actively creating the market for fuel cells, not only via its own cars and trucks, but now
also on the servicing side. This should help popularize fuel cells and their acceptance, widen their applications
and eventually lower costs. The fuel cell market at present lacks infrastructure and that is a bottleneck for

further growth. Providing such infrastructure is the route to celling more fuel cell vehicles for Toyota, so even if
this move helps rivals it is less of a concern for the car company.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Toho Gas opens Japan’s first “CO2-free” hydrogen service station
(Dempa Publications, March 2)
o  Toho Gas said it has opened Japan’s first hydrogen service stations that supply fuel
without attributable CO2 emissions. The utility is using carbon offsets and ramping up its
renewable energy output to make its hydrogen qualify for net-zero emissions.

•  The power station will be the world’s largest single-turbine geothermal power station, surpassing
the 140-megawatt Nga Awa Purua Geothermal Power Station, also in New Zealand.
•  Sumitomo Corporation previously teamed up with Fuji Electric on two occasions to construct

geothermal power stations in New Zealand, and Tauhara will be their third such project.



OPINION: Decarbonization, what industry needs to learn from past failures
(Nikkei, March 3)
•  CONTEXT: The author is Nakata Yukihiko, a lecturer at Ritsumeikan Asia-Pacific University.

•  Nakata says that while the global race to cut carbon dioxide emissions may hold the key to the
survival of Japan’s electronics industry, commercial success will not be easy.
•  Prime Minister Suga’s recent announcement of an ambitious plan to make Japan carbon neutral by
2050 is reminiscent of Sharp’s 1974 “Sunshine Project” to develop solar generation technologies,
and many subsequent, similar projects, says Nakata.
•  Japan’s geographical location makes it suited to offshore wind farms, and manufacturers such as

Toshiba are already preparing to manufacture turbines for these farms.
•  Japanese manufacturers have also made impressive achievements in the development of
perovskite solar cells.
•  However, a lack of competitiveness saw Japan’s LCD panel and semiconductor manufacturers lose
out to South Korean rivals. If we do not want to see history repeated in renewables, we must invest
in the sector now and learn from our industry’s past failures, says Nakata.




Kumagai Gumi invests in Vietnamese solar project
(New Energy Business News, March 5)
•  Japanese construction firm Kumagai Gumi has purchased a 30% stake in Vietnamese solar farm
operator Bind Ding TTP Energy & High Technology.
•  Bind Dung operates the 1 GW Cat Hiep solar farm in southern Vietnam, which has a 20-year

agreement to sell electricity to the state-owned Vietnam electricity company at a rate of 9.35 cents
per kilowatt hour.

Kansai Electric restarts Takahama NPP reactor Unit 3, and plans Unit 4 restart
(Various, March 7)
•  Kansai Electric said on March 5 that it will restart Unit 3 of its Takahama nuclear power plant in

Fukui prefecture on March 7. The reactor will reach criticality on March 8 and will run in power
adjustment mode from March 10.
•  Commercial operation will begin after comprehensive load performance inspection in the first 10
days of April.
•  The reactor was closed for planned maintenance work on Jan. 6, 2020. The shutdown period was
extended after damaged heat transfer piping was discovered.
•  The utility also plans to restart Unit 4 of the same NPP in the first 10 days of April, aiming for

commercial operations to being on May 7.
• TAKEAWAY: The restarts indicate that Kansai Electric has managed to overturn negative public opinion in the
Fukui region after its corruption scandal erupted 18 months ago. It shows that the antagonistic stance of Fukui
prefecture’s governor has also softened, likely due to pressure from the national government. Should the two
restarts proceed according to plan, Japan will have the most reactors online since May 2020. That would give
at least a small momentum for the industry to push for a greater return to the Japanese electricity market.

However, with so many false starts in the last few years, it is hard to be certain of any outcome for the nuclear
sector at this point.

•  Tokyo Gas invested ¥20 billion into Octopus Energy and plans to work with the U.K. firm to invest
in energy-related businesses in various European countries. Tokyo Gas has a 70% stake in the new
venture.



TEPCO CEO says will create a new industry in Fukushima based on reactor decommissioning

(Nikkei, March 6)
•  President Kobayakawa gave an interview in which he expressed his intention to create a new
industry in Fukushima prefecture based on the business of decommissioning the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi NPP, site of the major accident 10 years ago.
•  Under current plants, TEPCO plans to complete the decommissioning sometime between 2041
and 2051.
•  TEPCO is supposed to shoulder about ¥16 trillion in costs associated with the accident and says it

needs the restart of its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP to help generate funds. However, President
Kobayakawa acknowledged that the company has lost public trust and it will take an “extremely
long time”. He also said the company / operator must change.
•  TEPCO believes the restart of nuclear is key for Japan to meets its decarbonization goals.
•  Meanwhile, TEPCO wants to develop core, large-scale renewable energy, according to
Kobayakawa.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Mayor of city near TEPCO nuclear plant attacks legal issues around reactors
(Denki Shimbun, March 5)
o  Kashiwazaki Mayor Sakurai Masahiro said on Feb. 25 that he’ll look into establishing a
legal basis for the amendment of Japan’s Reactor Regulation Act.
o  The mayor called attention to the “safety agreements” that exist between municipalities
and power producers, which are not legally binding.

o  The Mayor said he was uncomfortable with a non-legally binding document that can
significantly impact reactor restarts and nuclear energy policy.
o  The Mayor’s comments represent a significant departure from the approach of his
predecessors, who have not intervened in issues of nuclear energy.
o  The Mayor has been extremely critical of TEPCO after the company’s recent security
breaches.

Fukushima Dai-Ichi: TEPCO removes last remaining fuel from Unit 3

(Nikkei, Feb. 28)
•  TEPCO Holdings said on Feb. 28 that it had removed the last 566 fuel rods from the spent fuel
pool attached to the Unit 3 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.
•  This is the second pool to have all its spent fuel removed, which comes before the nuclear
disaster’s 10th anniversary. The recovery effort has taken four years longer than expected.
•  However, around 1,000 fuel rods remain in the pools attached to Units 1 and 2, and work has not
even begun on the removal of highly radioactive molten reactor debris from Units 1, 2 or 3.

METI singles out “healthy” Chubu Electric for praise
(Denki Shimbun, March 5)
•  On March 4, the Ministry of Economy Industry and Trade, in partnership with the Tokyo Stock

Exchange, issued a list of 48 “healthy” businesses from 29 industries in which management, trade
unions, and workers join as a team to improve the health of the business and its employees. To be
selected, businesses also needed to demonstrate strong return on equity.
•  Chubu Electric was among those named, in recognition of initiatives to provide free antibody
testing, endoscopy, cancer screening, and other services to its employees.




The history of Japan’s only decommissioned nuclear reactor
(Nikkei X-Tech, March 4)
•  When you mention decommissioning of nuclear plants, most people think of the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi, which is expected to take another 20 to 30 years to decommission, at a cost of ¥8 trillion.
However, Fukushima is a special case, due to the difficulty of collecting molten debris generated
by the meltdown and subsequent explosion.
•  All of Japan’s nuclear power plants will have to be decommissioned sooner or later. Japanese law

requires nuclear plants to be decommissioned at the end of their 40-year operating life, and 24 of
Japan’s 60 reactors are already slated for decommissioning.
•  There is only one example of a Japanese nuclear reactor that has been successfully
decommissioned: the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor, which was fully decommissioned by
1996. The former reactor site can now be used for construction.

ENEOS signs MoU with Vietnam’s Petrolimex to Develop LNG, Oil, Solar Generation
(Company statement, media reports, March 4)
•  ENEOS said it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-owned Vietnam National
Petroleum Group, also known as Petrolimex. The two parties agreed to pursue a number of

business expansions in Vietnam.
•  ENEOS said it will promote its partnership with Petrolimex also by increasing its shareholding in
the Vietnamese company.
•  Top of the agenda for the two companies is a plan to build and operate an LNG terminal and gas-
fired power plant in the country. ENEOS and Petrolimex will make joint procurement of LNG for
the facilities.
•  ENEOS will also improve Petrolimex’s petroleum products business by linking more of the

procurement to its own refineries. In return, Petrolimex offers ENEOS access to its petroleum
import terminal.
•  The partners will look at the potential to develop a hydrogen business in Vietnam, and also study
solar power generation opportunities, such as by installing panels at service stations and terminals
in the country.
•  CONTEXT: In April 2016, ENEOS first took a stake in Petrolimex, buying 8% of the state company.
The idea was for ENEOS to get access to distribution channels in a growing economy, while the

Vietnamese company would gain know-how from the Japanese side.
• TAKEAWAY: Last year’s transactions, once cleared, should allow ENEOS to raise its stake in Petrolimex to
around 10%. A major delay was the political uncertainty in Vietnam, with the elite Politburo meeting due in
January 2021. The meeting concluded with the Feb. 1 re-election of Nguyen Phu Trong as the General
Secretary of the Communist Party and de facto leader of the country. This political resolution seems to have
instilled confidence on both sides and the original ENEOS-Petrolimex partnership is now expanding from
petroleum products to LNG infrastructure, hydrogen and renewables.

Government approves plan to reorganize No. 4 gas utility, Saibu Gas
(Japan NRG, March 4)
•  CONTEXT: Saibu Gas is Japan’s No. 4 gas utility, ranking together with Tokyo, Osaka and Toho as

the biggest players in the domestic industry. Since 2016, the government has committed to an
unbundling and deregulation of the electricity and gas industries.
•  METI announced on March 1 that it agreed on a plan to restructure Saibu Gas, the group based in
the Fukuoka, Kyushu area.
•  The company will be split into four: Saibu Gas Break-up Preparation Co., Saibu Gas Kumamoto,
Saibu Gas Nagasaki, and Saibu Gas Sasebo. All the entities will be under the control of a holding
company. The changes will be made by March 2023.
•  The government believes that this will increase the value of the separate entities and also lower the

gas unit cost by as much as 16%.
•  The new entities will find it easier to make real estate acquisitions and to increase their capital,
according to a METI statement.




Hokkaido Gas to purchase carbon-neutral LNG from Mitsui
(Denki Shimbun, March 1)
•  Hokkaido Gas said on Feb. 26 that in a first for Hokkaido Prefecture it will soon supplement the gas
it provides with carbon-neutral LNG procured from Mitsui and Co.
•  The first shipment will arrive on March 18.
•  Mitsui and Co. will supply Hokkaido Gas with 64,000 metric tons of carbon neutral LNG each year.,

or around 10% of the utility’s total annual supply,
• TAKEAWAY: See our Feb. 15 edition for details of how the carbon-neutral LNG market in Japan, which is
mostly supported by Tokyo Gas, is developing.





ENEOS to shut down bitumen-fired power plant
(Sekiyu Shimbun, March 2)
•  ENEOS said on Feb. 26 that it will shut down its Osaka bitumen-fired power plant in autumn.
•  While the plant plays an important role in disposing of heavy distillates yielded by ENEOS’ oil
refinery, the company decided that changes in the electricity market and in demand for heavy
petroleum products, as well as new International Maritime Organization regulations on fuel oil
quality, mean that the plant should be closed to enhance ENEOS’ competitiveness.

•  The 159 people employed at the 130 MW plant will be transferred to other areas. Bitumen is also
known as asphalt.

Ten Years on from the Nuclear Accident,
Fukushima Area Aims to be a Silicon Valley of Renewable Energy

Fukushima prefecture vowed soon after the accident at TEPCO’s Dai-Ichi nuclear
station in March 2011 that the disaster would not define it. True to its word, the area
has reinvented itself as a bastion of renewables and energy experimentation that has
elicited interest from startups and industry veterans alike.

Before 2011, Fukushima was home to 10 reactors, the second-largest concentration of
nuclear power in Japan. Ten years on, the prefecture generates over 80% of its
electricity from renewable sources and says this will reach 100% within four more
years. In March 2020, one of the world’s largest green hydrogen facilities opened in
the local town of Namie.

While it’s unlikely that Fukushima’s new energy blueprint will be adopted wholesale
across Japan, the region has become a hotbed of innovation that will have a notable
impact nationwide.

Fukushima’s achievements stem from much more than token efforts at reparations.

From ghost town to gas town
In the aftermath of the accident at Dai-Ichi NPP, caused by the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami, Namie became a ghost town. Lying about 20 km north of the NPP, its
population was evacuated and put into temporary housing. The town was part of a
no-go zone around the wrecked nuclear station.

Many said life in towns like Namie would never return. Many questioned the rationale
and the budgets expended by the government in rehabilitating the lands around the
Dai-Ichi site.

|  | From ghost town to gas town |
|  | In the aftermath of the accident at Dai-Ichi NPP, caused by the March 11 earthquake |

|  | Many said life in towns like Namie would never return. Many questioned the rationale |
|  | and the budgets expended by the government in rehabilitating the lands around the |
|  | Dai-Ichi site. |
|  |  |

Namie has shown a will not only to revive, but to do in a way that’s an example for the
rest of the country.

This year, the town’s authorities started construction of an industrial zone that will be
fully powered by renewable energy when it opens in 2023. The locality of 1,200 or so
has two solar plants and a wind farm. A biomass power plant is due onstream in the
coming months. There are feasibility studies under way for a small hydropower plant
and even an experimental wave power plant.

“We offer no subsidies,” a Namie town official said. “Sure, the town receives
subsidies from the prefectural and national governments for some projects, but that is
not why businesses of all types are coming to Namie. They are not here for the
government money. They come because there’s an entrepreneurial spirit here.”

The town population is slowly starting to recover, even though there is a lack of
available housing. Since the 2011 accident, reconstruction focused on infrastructure
such as industrial parks, power plants and research centers, leaving housing stock
repairs behind.

The industrial revival and the extraordinary circumstances allowed Namie to cut the
red tape and open itself up to trials of various alternative energy projects.

Brother Industry is testing hydrogen pipelines in the area, studying their transmission
efficiency and safety when the pipes are affixed to electric poles.

The town has its own drone testing ground and Nissan Motor has used the locality for
automated driving trials.

Sumitomo Corp. has plans to build a “multi-vehicular hydrogen service station”. This
would be no ordinary stopover for fuel cells. The facility is designed to service both
passenger and commercial fuel cell autos, as well as other vehicles that are yet to be
created. For example, hydrogen bicycles.

Since last March, Namie also plays host to the Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research
Field (FH2R), one of the world’s top hydrogen production plants. It is situated in the
Tanashio Industrial Zone along the coast and has a 10 MW capacity, while also
powered by a 20 MW of solar capacity.

FH2R is already connected to the Tohoku Electric grid, which means it can be used as
part of the local electricity supply, as well as a hydrogen-generating facility.

The plant made headlines in December last year when it supplied the fuel cell systems
that powered rock concerts at the giant Saitama Arena stadium.

FH2R also has plans to add its own hydrogen service station and to conduct on-site
smart car system tests. Town officials expect delivery of the first fuel cell vehicles to
the town sometime this month.

“All sorts of pioneers have come here, from trading houses to construction firms,
carmakers, manufacturers, and academics,” the Namie town official said.

Prefecture-wide rollout of renewables
The rest of Fukushima is much like Namie, renewables-minded. On Feb. 9, the
prefecture government said it wants all of the electricity consumed in the region to
come from renewable sources by 2025. In 2019, renewables accounted for 80.5% of
Fukushima’s power consumption, or 12.07 billion kWh.

Based on 2025 power demand forecasts holding flat at 15 billion kWh, the region
needs to increase its renewable output by 25%.

Since the 2011 accident, the expansion in local renewables capacity has been
immense, rising seven-fold to 2,582 MW by the end of 2019. Most of that is due to
the installation of solar farms. Solar capacity has surged to 2,110 MW, which is a
whopping 32-fold increase.

This strong expansion convinced Fukushima Souden, a JV between a local power
utility and TEPCO, to add new transmission lines in January 2020 in order to link the
new solar plants to TEPCO’s grid system, bringing their energy to a wider market.

The solar push has come despite the fact that Fukushima is not a sunny region. The
area gets 1,700 hours of sunlight a year, less than the national average of 1,900 hours.
However, Fukushima has strong winds, with over 6 m/s on average. It also has the
fourth-largest forest lands in the country and a strong agriculture sector, as well as
many small rivers. Heavy snows in the Aezu area could also be turned into an energy
source, according to the prefecture’s studies.

Over the next decade, the regional government says it wants to make a concerted
effort in non-solar renewable sources.

The reconstruction of Fukushima is far from complete, even ten years on from the
disaster. The area’s advances in energy infrastructure and innovation are yet to be
matched by a revival in comfort and entertainment facilities and even basic lifestyle
essentials, such as supermarkets and drug stores.

Still, Namie officials say the local mood is upbeat and motivated. There is a strong
collaborative spirit and belief in entrepreneurship.

“Every day there are problems, but people help each other.” The key to any real
reconstruction is “comradery, not money.”

January’s Electricity Price Spike Didn’t Kill the Retail Market;
It Opened New Opportunities for “Good Actors


As Mark Twain might have said, reports of the death of Japan’s power retailers have
been greatly exaggerated. In fact, many of the “new electricity firms” that appeared
after the market’s deregulation are now in an even stronger position to succeed and
challenge the incumbent power utilities. Here’s why.

Industry impact of the crisis
About 35% of power generated in Japan is traded on the Japan Electric Power
Exchange (JEPX). As such, when the 24-hour average system price spiked for a few
days in January 2021, and even briefly hit an all-time high of ¥154.6/ kWh on Jan. 13,
many facets of the market were disrupted. Undoubtedly, one of the most-affected
groups was Japan’s new power retailers, which rely on the exchange to procure the
vast majority of their customers’ electricity volumes.

Rakuten Energy, Japan’s 10th-largest household power retailer, stopped accepting
new contract applications. Kazuno Power, established in 2019 to sell renewable
energy in Akita prefecture, suspended all operations. Looop, a large retailer and
renewable power generator, opened talks with several parties to buy distressed power
retail business assets.
While the price spike affected power retailers in general, it especially put pressure on
those offering variable-rate plans. This only applies to 1.86% of Japan’s power sales,
and yet it still adds up to as many as 800,000 contracts, mostly residential.
As the name suggests, the price that customers on variable plans have to pay is, to a
varying degree, tied to the JEPX day-ahead market price and, generally, recalculated
every 30 minutes. This works in the customer’s favor when JEPX prices are low, but it
can flip into a higher power bill if spot electricity prices increase. In the case of the
recent spike, some saw their power bills more than double.

Making things even worse was the fact that many of the retailers aggressively
promoted their variable-rate plans during 2020 when JEPX day-ahead prices were
low. The average weekday price in the Tokyo zone in November was just ¥5.51/ kWh,
down from ¥9.03/ kWh a year earlier.

ENEOS and Nissan even started to announce electric vehicle charging costs based on
variable-rate plan power prices.

How power retailers reacted

Contractually, retailers are not required in any way to compensate customers on
variable-rate plans for a rising price. However, some decided to do so anyway in the
aftermath of the price spike to take partial responsibility and acknowledge that the
average residential customer might not have understood the risks of such pricing.

| It Opened New Opportunities for “Good Actors |

Genie Energy, a retailer that offers both variable- and fixed-rate plans, gave customers
on the variable plan the option to switch.
Those with only a variable-rate plan offered up-to-date power price information and
even an easy way to exit their contract. Shizen Energy reminded customers that their
contracts did not carry a termination fee. Fellow retailer Direct Power waived its
¥2,000 fee for cancellations.

Shizen also announced that it would discount variable-rate electricity bills by up to
¥30,000 yen as compensation. Hachidori Denryoku promised to match the bills
offered by the incumbent power utilities in its customers’ areas, and that it would carry
all excess costs until the end of February.

The above showed a higher level of customer service that the new power retail
companies have brought to the Japanese electricity market.
That said, clearly some of the retailers failed this litmus test. One firm, Haluene,
suspended its main phone line and limited call center availability, blaming the
changes on COVID-19. METI went on to issue formal warnings to a number of industry
players after certain call center response rates dropped below 50%.

Officials may escalate this further and issue an “order for business improvement” to
some retail firms for their failure to properly explain the nature of variable-rate plans
to customers. There’s precedent for this last year after Chubu Electric Power Miraiz
was issued such an order for failure in some cases to deliver legal contract documents
to customers. Violating these orders can be punished with penalties of up to ¥3
million and even revocation of retailer registration.

As a consequence, we expect some retailers to introduce price caps on variable-rate
plans.

New opportunities for power retailers
While the recent JEPX price spike means that retailers have to rethink the way they
structure and present their offerings, the situation also highlighted opportunities in
the Japanese market for products and services that help limit volatility. These include
fixed-rate plans, residential power purchase agreements (PPAs), peer-to-peer (P2P)
power trading, and energy resource aggregation businesses (ERAB).

Increasing adoption of residential PPAs will allow households (just like they allow
corporations) to secure power at a stable rate for a long period of time. For example,
Sharing Energy, a company which entered this space about three years ago, offers
agreements in which it installs solar panels for free in exchange for the household
buying power from the company. After 10 years, ownership of the panels is
transferred to the house owner.
Okinawa EPCo is also eyeing this market. Starting in April, it will offer residential PPAs
that include solar panels and storage batteries.

Creating more opportunities for P2P power trading will allow power consumers access
to new supply sources. Denryoku Sharing started a P2P trading system among farmers
in December 2020. Through this, farmers with agri-voltaic systems can supply excess
power to their neighbors.
Lastly, the growth of ERAB will help stabilize JEPX prices by reducing imbalances
between supply and demand through the introduction of virtual power plants and
demand response services. Yano Research Institute estimates that this market will
grow from ¥4.4 billion in FY2019 to as much as ¥73 billion in FY2030. Some
companies that entered this market recently include Symenergy, which introduced a
demand response service for high-voltage customers, and Enechange and Looop,
which jointly started a demand response service for low-voltage customers.

In addition to opportunities on the consumer side, there are options to explore in
power procurement. Trading on the futures markets has already significantly
increased, and opportunities related to risk management products and services are
expected to grow.

In the short-term, many will remember the JEPX price spike as an energy crisis that
“burned” the burgeoning power retail sector. However, it also acted as a stress test to
weed out the “bad actors” that abandoned their customers and highlighted those
that acted with superior customer service.

It’s not yet clear how many of the 800,000 customers with a variable price plan will
switch to a fixed rate. But, it’s fair to say that the actions of the “good actors” weaken
any government rationale to reverse deregulation of the electricity market, as some
conservative voices in Japanese energy have called for since the advent of the price
spike.

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Myanmar:
The unfolding situation in Myanmar following the Feb. 1 coup is continuing to create
significant commercial and diplomatic challenges for other Asian countries, including
Japan. More than 50 civilian protestors have been killed over the last five weeks, and
it seems a nation-wide strike is imminent that could close access to energy networks,
including the oil and gas pipelines linking the port of Kyaukphyu on the Bay of Bengal
to Kunming in China. Infrastructure sabotage may also be a risk for investors. Last
Wednesday was the bloodiest day so far, with 38 fatalities including children.
One Japanese company has been put on a watch-list by a major institutional investor
because of its links to companies controlled by the military junta. At least 60 other
foreign firms are thought to have economic connections with the junta.
As well as the implementation of sanctions, U.S. government officials halted the
movement of $1 billion in the name of the Central Bank of Myanmar shortly after the
coup. Various sanctions have been enacted by the U.S. and the EU against members
of the junta, but they appear to have been ineffective so far. However, local bank
strikes are crippling the economy.
Air travel into the country is limited due to access to jet fuel at airports. ANA is
refueling in Okinawa prior to completing round-trip flights to Yangon to evacuate
Japanese nationals. Marubeni, Mitsui, Toyota Tsusho, Hitachi Metals, Sumitomo, and
Sojitz are among the 400 Japanese corporate investors in the country. The total
cumulative Japanese FDI investment in Myanmar may exceed $2 billion. France’s
Total, Petronas, and Chevron are also invested in the country. At one point, workers
on a Petronas offshore platform were stranded due to the coup.
The Myanmar army, the Tatmadaw, is the biggest in South East Asia after Vietnam,
with over 500,000 personnel, and a budget of over $2.5 billion or 10% of GDP. Russia,
China and North Korea are its major suppliers. Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is
considering suspending official development aid to the country as Japan’s
Development Cooperation Charter calls for ODA suspensions when basic human
rights are violated.

Oil:
Brent closed the week just below $70, up $20 YTD, following the OPEC+
announcement to keep production cuts in place for an additional month. Rystad
believes oil prices could go significantly higher.
However, the 23 OPEC+ countries are thought to need an average $95 oil price to
balance fiscal budgets.
Meanwhile, CEO of Occidental Petroleum, Vicki Hollub, said she believes U.S. oil
production will never recover to the pre-pandemic peaks.

Biomass:
Microsoft will build a negative-emissions biomass plant in Mendota, California with
Schlumberger and Chevron.

CO2 Emissions:
Global energy-related CO2 emissions were 2% higher in December 2020 YoY
reversing the pandemic-induced reductions.

Aviation:
1). Skydio, a Californian drone-maker, became the first U.S. drone-maker to be valued
at more than $1 billion.
2). Lufthansa reported the worst loss in its history, for FY2020 — $6.6 billion — and
does not expect a full recovery before 2025.

Critical Rare Metals:
1). Last week copper prices exceeded $9,000 a ton. Polymetal, the Russian precious
metals producer, announced it will increase its exploration budget for copper and
other rare metals as the energy transition gains momentum.
2). Tesla signed a deal to buy nickel with a New Caledonian mine, the Goro mine, to
strengthen its lithium-ion cell production supply chains. Tesla also lost almost $100
billion in market capitalization last week.

ESG:
Cevian Capital, the activist investor, is demanding that ESG targets be used to
determine executive compensation.

COP26:
Alok Sharma has been on his first diplomatic tour since taking on the role of COP26
U.K. President on a full-time basis. He has visited Belgium, Nepal, India, Nigeria,
Egypt, Ethiopia, and Gabon last month.

China:
At the NPC conclave in Beijing, China announced an economic growth target of 6%
for 2021 and is planning to create 11 million new urban jobs this year. In the five-year
plan released on Friday, China stressed the need to achieve energy security alongside
the goals of peaking emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.
Specifically, the country committed to build an additional 20 GW of nuclear power by
2025 including SMRs, third-generation coastal plants, and offshore floating nuclear
plants; reduce carbon intensity and energy use per unit of GDP by 18% and 14%
respectively; and promised that 20% of the country’s energy will come from non-fossil
sources by 2025, an increase of 25% compared with 2020.

South Korea:
LG Chem will build a battery factory with GM in Tennessee.

India:
India is investigating whether China orchestrated the 2020 Mumbai power blackouts.

Pakistan:
Pakistan is expected to issue $1 billion in inaugural nature bonds, or sustainability-
linked bonds, later this year that will be used to finance nature-based solutions to
climate-change.

Russia:
1). Moscow will quadruple the number of electric buses by 2030, phasing out all
petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.
2). The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB, and seven
other senior Russian officials and 14 entities in connection with the attempted murder
of Alexei Navalny. The EU applied similar Magnitsky-style sanctions on four different
Russian officials including the prosecutor-general and the heads of the national guard
and the prison service.
3). The U.S. has also imposed sanctions against Igor Kolomoisky, a Russian oligarch,
for corruption committed in Ukraine.

Israel:
An Israeli-owned cargo ship was attacked in the Gulf of Oman, with PM Netanyahu
attributing the attack to Iran.

Egypt:
1). Japan will allocate $240 million to Egypt through JICA to support the green
economy and the development of renewable energies.
2). Egypt is considering making a formal application to host the COP27 summit in
2022. Under the UN system of regional rotation, it would be the turn of Africa to host
the next climate summit. A decision is expected to be made at COP26.

Sweden:
Volvo will transition its entire fleet to EVs by 2030 and phase out dealerships with all
sales conducted on-line.

Portugal:
EDP, the Portuguese utility, announced that it will double RE capacity to almost 75
GW by 2030.

Canada:
Canada’s Neo Performance Materials Inc. will team up with two U.S companies,
Energy Fuels and Chemours, to produce rare earths from monazite sands for use in
EVs.

U.S:
1). ERCOT fired CEO Bill Magnus following the Texas freeze fiasco.
2). Brazos, a generation and transmission cooperative in Texas, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy with debts of over $2 billion arising from the Texas freeze. Bank of
America is now thought to have gained millions from the same extreme market
volatility in Texas as part of its hedging derivatives unit.
3). Charif Souki, the founder of Tellurian, the Houston-based natural gas company,
described the power grids in California and Texas as “dysfunctional”.
4). Exxon appointed two new independent directors and will increase its investments
in carbon capture and storage.
5). The American Society of Civil Engineers gave U.S infrastructure a C- grade in its
annual assessment and called for $6 trillion of infrastructure investments over the next

budgets need to be cut by $200 billion per annum to finance the build-out of
infrastructure.
6). The Association of American Railroads will release a paper today for the U.S.
administration outlining emissions reduction strategies that favor railroad freight
transportation over road haulage.

Kerry as energy transition gains momentum with the advent of the new U.S.
administration.
9). In his annual letter to shareholders Warren Buffett disclosed that Berkshire is the
largest holder of fixed assets in the U.S. with over $150 billion, and his energy
portfolio is unlikely to pay a dividend before 2030 due to capital investments required
to reinforce the U.S. power grid.

South America:
1). The EU-Mercosur trade deal negotiated with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and
Paraguay continues to stall because of environmental concerns over deforestation in
the Amazon.
2). In Brazil, four Petronas board members quit following the sacking of the CEO.
