NEWS:    GENERAL      OUTLOOK       AND   TRENDS


Financial results of 10 major EPCOs: 7 report profit declines or losses

(Nikkei, July 31)
•  The consolidated financial results for Q1 2025 of the 10 major power utilities (EPCOs) were
announced. Seven reported profit declines or losses.
•  Excluding TEPCO, which faced a significant loss, the combined final profit of the other nine
companies was ¥368.3 billion, down 11% YoY.
•  Intensified competition for customer acquisition, particularly in the corporate sector, led to
noticeable sales volume reductions for many companies.
•  Tohoku Electric, which restarted Unit 2 of Onagawa NPP (Miyagi Pref) in October 2024, saw a 38%
YoY decline in net profit to ¥37.7 billion. While the restart reduced fuel costs for thermal
generation, a drop in electricity sales volume – especially to corporate clients – impacted results.
•  Kansai Electric reported a 14% profit decline to ¥99.1 billion, as Unit 3 of Mihama NPP and Unit 3
of Takahama NPP underwent scheduled inspections.

¥900 billion needed for debris removal at Fukushima

(Nikkei, July 30)
•  TEPCO will need about ¥900 billion to prepare for large-scale removal of melted nuclear fuel
(debris) from Fukushima Daiichi Unit 3. The cost covers construction of new equipment and
facilities ahead of debris removal, planned to start from FY2037.
•  TEPCO will book part of the cost as a loss in its FY2025 results. TEPCO funds decommissioning costs
from annual profits.
•  The ¥900 billion figure, part of the overall estimated ¥8 trillion Fukushima decommissioning
budget, covers constructing new facilities atop reactor buildings and dismantling waste storage
facilities nearby.
•  CONTEXT: Debris removal, an estimated 880 tons in Units 1–3, is a key hurdle. TEPCO began trial
removal at Unit 2 in 2024 and has collected only 0.9 g so far. The govt and TEPCO aim to complete
decommissioning of all six Fukushima reactors by 2051. Full-scale debris removal from Unit 3 should
begin in FY2037.
•  CONTEXT: The ¥8 trillion estimate is a rough figure, based on past cases like Three Mile Island. If costs
exceed this amount, TEPCO will need to further strengthen its earnings. As of late FY2024, TEPCO has
accumulated ¥700 billion in a special decommissioning reserve. The company contributes ¥260 billion
each year to the reserve.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO to post loss due to Fukushima decommissioning
(Nikkei, July 31)
o  TEPCO will likely post a net loss of around ¥850 billion for Q1 2025, due to costs related to
preparations for removing debris from Fukushima Daiichi NPP.
o  This is TEPCO’s second-largest quarterly loss since the 2011 earthquake. In contrast, the
same quarter last year saw a net profit of ¥79.2 billion.



Tohoku Electric gains approval for spent fuel dry storage at Onagawa

(Company statement, July 29)
•  Tohoku Electric got prior approval from Miyagi Pref for a spent fuel dry storage facility at Onagawa
NPP Unit 2.
•  The facility will consist of a dry storage building and robust metal containers to store cooled spent
fuel from the Unit 2 pool.


12



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: The company is aiming to start operations in March 2028 for the first unit and June 2032
for the second. Unit 2 fuel pool can hold up to 1,680 assemblies. The reactor resumed operation in Dec
2024. There are around 1,335 assemblies stored. The pool could reach full capacity in four years.
• TAKEAWAY: The approval is conditional on the fact that the facility will be temporary storage. After that, the
utility should send the spent fuel to the reprocessing plant under construction in Aomori Pref. But, the lack of a
workable plan for spent nuclear fuel, due to repeated delays in facilities completion, remains a weak point in the
nuclear sector.



Hamamatsu Photonics and EX-Fusion conduct demo test for laser fusion
(Company statement, July 31)
•  Hamamatsu Photonics and EX-Fusion held a demo test of a key technology for laser fusion research
– irradiating high-power pulsed lasers onto simulated fuel targets.
•  Currently, most laser fusion experiments use single-shot laser irradiation. Yet, future research could
shift toward continuous laser irradiation, enabling more efficient and stable energy generation.
•  If they manage to scale the technology up to kilojoule-class lasers, it could lead to a new approach
to laser fusion.
•  CONTEXT: EX-Fusion plans to conduct a demo by late 2026 to achieve one hour of continuous nuclear

fusion reaction. Success would mark a step toward power generation demos in the 2030s.


Kyushu Electric spots possible drones over Genkai NPP

(Company statement, July 27)

JAPEX acquires stake in oil and gas fields in Norway
(Company statement, July 29)
•  JAPEX agreed with Aker BP to buy a 10% stake in the Alve Nord development and a 3.5% stake in
the Verdande Unit in Norway. For its part of the deal, JAPEX will transfer stakes in several other
licenses and pay $14 million.
•  Verdande should start production in autumn, and Alve Nord in early 2027. The deal is subject to
Norwegian regulatory approval.
•  CONTEXT: Aker BP is one of Norway's main oil & gas companies. JAPEX entered the Norway market in
2023 and this year made a discovery at Kjøttkake. This follows last week’s agreement by INPEX to buy
stakes in several Norwegian oil & gas fields from Pandion Energy.
•  CONTEXT: Alve Nord is an oil & gas development project in the Norwegian Sea, operated by Aker BP
and expected to start production in early 2027. It is a lower-risk asset, already approved and moving

toward output. Kjøttkake, in the Northern North Sea, is still in the exploration phase. While Kjøttkake
has future potential, it requires further evaluation before development can begin.

•  Japan imported 10.2 million kiloliters of crude
oil in June, down 7.6% over May, but 12.3%
more YoY. Nearly 94% came from the Middle
East. In H1 2025, 44% of crude oil came from
UAE and 40% from Saudi Arabia, which may
mean UAE is likely to be the top supplier to
Japan, as in 2024. The first shipment from
Russia in 2025 has arrived, but it was less than
0.1 mil kiloliters.



•  LNG imports in June totaled 4.4 Mt, down 4.8%
over May (4.7 Mt) and down 2.8% YoY. Nearly
50% of LNG came from Australia, and another
30% came from the Asia Pacific region, meaning
nearly 80% of LNG was supplied by nearby
countries. In February, Japan agreed to import
LNG from Canada. LNG from Canada can reach
Japan within 10 days. The first Canadian
shipment arrived in July.






•  Thermal coal imports in June were 6 Mt, up 4.2%
from May. Australia and Indonesia were the top
two suppliers, accounting for over 80% of total
imports. Imports from Canada decreased by almost
40%, those from the U.S. rose nearly 60%. Japan’s
power companies are taking all possible measures
to secure and stabilize electricity supplies during
the hot summer, and coal is a trusted backup.

Offshore Wind in Crisis – But New Areas and Floating Tech Offer Hope
The offshore wind sector, touted as a cornerstone of Japan’s 2050 decarbonization
strategy, is in turmoil. At the center of the crisis is Mitsubishi Corp’s potential
withdrawal from three flagship offshore wind projects, a move that could trigger a wider
collapse of investor confidence, supply chain momentum, and future auctions.

In a significant move to regain momentum, on July 30, METI and MLIT designated the
areas of Matsumae and Hiyama, located off the coast of Hokkaido, as “promotion
zones”. This is the first such designation in the waters off Hokkaido, a region known for
strong winds. The two areas are expected to feature in a public tender as early as this
fall.
Officials hope the announcement will excite project-starved developers, given the
parameters at stake. The Matsumae area has been expanded to 3,710 hectares and is
expected to offer 250–310 MW of capacity. The Hiyama plot is one of Japan’s largest
offshore wind allocations and is projected to accommodate capacities of 910 MW to 1.14
GW.

Designation of the new areas does not come a minute too soon. Mitsubishi has set the
end of summer as its deadline for resolving talks with METI and other state entities over
how – or whether – it continues to develop offshore wind farms. The discussions have
grown complicated, with other wind players sensitive to any signs of favoritism or rule
changes. The outcome is seen impacting projects in other auction rounds.
With the mercury level in talks and on the streets rising, authorities are determined to
salvage their renewables strategies, and the national CO2 reductions associated with
them. Hokkaido areas, a new EEZ Law, and advances in floating wind are just some
positive steps that officials believe support their stance.

The offshore wind sector is in pain, but it’s not terminal.

Mitsubishi’s exit threatens stability
In 2021, Mitsubishi, in partnership with Chubu Electric, stunned the industry by winning
all three sites in Japan’s first-ever public auction (Round 1), offering rock-bottom bids
that many viewed as unsustainable.

Four years on, global and local macro factors have whipped up the necessary outlays by
at least 20-30% due to rising construction and labor costs, a weak yen, and surging
inflation.
In February 2025, Mitsubishi could not hide the pain any longer, booking a ¥52.4 billion
impairment on the projects; Chubu Electric posted an ¥18.6 billion loss of its own.

Among its many missteps, Mitsubishi had failed to lock in its turbine supply before the
cost tsunami arrived. The trading house listed GE’s Haliade-X turbines for all three
projects – a total of 134 units, covering 1.7 GW of capacity.

But with the preliminary steps around area preparation delayed by additional surveys,
it’s understood that the Japanese developer was not ready to place the turbine order. In
2024, GE Vernova (as the company is now known) paused all new orders for wind
turbines citing difficult market conditions.

Mitsubishi had banked on 2021 prices, but faced 2024 costs that the U.S. turbine maker
was in no position to absorb.

Globally, the cost of turbines and their installation accounts for as much as half of the
CAPEX of an offshore wind project. Mitsubishi had reportedly arranged for Kajima Corp
to be its general contractor for all three Round 1 projects. It’s still unclear how much of
that work cost has been locked in, with the developer yet to proceed to the construction
stage.
With internal budgets for its three offshore wind projects no longer making economic
sense, Mitsubishi shocked observers earlier this year by floating the idea of a complete
exit from the sector before softening its stance and promising to reassess its position by
end of summer.

Yet the uncertainty has already stalled the broader market. Round 4 of the public
auctions is delayed. Equipment vendors have paused investments. METI’s offshore wind
strategy, which envisioned as much as 45 GW of capacity online by 2040, faced the
threat of a domino effect.
FIP rule change: help or hindrance?
In an effort to salvage Round 1 projects, METI considered a controversial plan to shift
them from the original Fixed Feed-in Tariff (FIT) system to a Feed-in Premium (FIP)
model. All R1 bids were made under the more predictable FIT, while R2 and R3 were
conducted under the auspices of FIP.

The FIT is more predictable, locking in the sale of electricity under a government-backed
scheme. The buyers are EPCOs, the major power utilities that pay a fixed price for 20
years. The revenue is guaranteed but doesn’t allow operators to pick their electricity
buyers.
Under the FIP, on the other hand, sellers have leeway on production volumes and use
spot power prices or bilateral transactions to make money. The government only
commits to an FIP “premium”: a small subsidy paid on top of the spot electricity price to
pare market risks with some predictable income, thus supporting the rollout of
renewables.

As Japan was still in the process of switching from FIT to FIP during the first offshore
wind auctions, Mitsubishi benefited from the more stable FIT scheme. However, it aimed
to build on its FIT fees with power purchase agreements (PPAs). The developer attracted
potential future offtakers such as Amazon and Kirin as “partners” in its R1 projects, but
with the wind farms not due online until the end of this decade it was too early to sign
the PPAs.
Allowing Mitsubishi to convert its R1 projects to FIP would help to support the projects’
economics – even if it may not plug all the gaps. It would also help attract offtakers at a
more elevated price point aligned with market electricity rates. However, it would also
potentially put R2 and R3 projects at a disadvantage.

Amid fierce competition in the ensuing rounds, nearly all developers put in “zero
premium” bids, which means they agreed to forego the top-up payment from the
government above the market electricity price. So, when these projects go to market
their electricity to offtakers, they could face competition with Mitsubishi’s capacity –
which is exactly one of the reasons some developers pushed back on METI’s initial
suggestion.

Mitsubishi and other firms have explored other means of bringing down costs, such as
sounding out METI’s willingness to accept Chinese-made wind turbines – significantly
cheaper than Western counterparts.
But Japanese officials firmly rejected the idea over national security and industrial policy
concerns. METI still hopes that Japan can develop a domestic or allied supply chain,
even at a higher short-term cost. Meanwhile, turbines carry a multitude of sensors that
can be operated remotely.

In the end, with few options to reduce the main cost item – turbines – and frustration
over the discrepancy between R1 and other projects, industry discussions stalled this
summer.

Some are calling for Mitsubishi to exit and its projects re–auctioned. Others see the
trading house keeping one or two of the projects, and handing the government back the
rest. Potential outside investment into Mitsubishi’s consortium or individual projects has
not been ruled out, although it’s clear to all sides that financial injections alone would
not resolve all the issues.
Industry stalls; Investors retreat
Meanwhile, the furore has backed METI into a corner. As bureaucrats, METI and the
Ministry of Transport officials are not allowed to favor one side or another. But helping
Mitsubishi in some form risks being seen as doing just that, which would damage the
credibility of the Japanese government as a fair market regulator.

Few expect that a brokered solution over R1 projects would be enough. Similar
adjustments are sought by R2 and R3 related parties.

Foreign developers and suppliers, once bullish on Japan, are growing both wary and
impatient. Denmark’s Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) has openly criticized
Japan’s market structure, citing high seabed lease fees, underdeveloped supply chains,
and an unpredictable regulatory environment. At least one of the current project
developers is rumored pondering an exit if an opportunity arises.
GE Vernova’s original plans to build nacelles in Japan with Toshiba, as early as 2026,
seem to be in a frozen state. The appetite of supply chain companies has also been
tested amid poor visibility on future project developments and concern about the scale
of the local market.

Compounding these concerns, Mitsubishi in December 2024 pledged to sell all of its UK
subsea power transmission businesses despite stable earnings, thus reducing Japan’s
ability to secure key infrastructure in-house.
Still, many industry insiders say this is the dip before the sector’s recovery.

Pivot to floating wind
Despite temporary stagnation in the fixed-bottom part of the wind market, there’s been
quiet progress in floating offshore wind. With only narrow continental shelves, much of
Japan’s coastline is unsuitable for fixed-bottom installations. However, it is ideal for
floating turbines.

Recent signs point to growing momentum:
• June 2025: the Diet passed the ‘EEZ Law’ that allows for the installation of offshore
wind farms in Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which covers areas further
than 12 nautical miles from the baseline

19



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o What’s more, unlike current offshore wind development that has to go
through local government and stakeholders, the EEX lies entirely in the
jurisdiction of the national government
• July 2025: METI signed an MoU with Siemens Gamesa and GE Vernova to jointly
develop domestic wind supply chains, including key components like permanent
magnets sourced from Japanese electronics firm TDK.
• June 2025: METI newly designated five floating wind sites off Tokyo Bay
sparking a burst of activity with the first floating demo project in the area.
• METI is working to diversify wind technologies under its Green Innovation Fund
and hinted that it may prioritize floating wind in upcoming auctions.
• July 2025: The recently announced Matsumae and Hiyama promotion zones, while
capable of hosting fixed-bottom turbines, could become test grounds for floating
platforms due to their water depths. METI has also indicated that it will include
specific measures in these zones to ease development, such as alleviating talks with
fisheries stakeholders.
Industry watchers suggest that Japan’s floating wind segment is where the UK’s offshore
wind was 20 years ago: small, high-risk, but full of long-term strategic potential.
What happens next?
The government is expected to make key announcements by the end of summer 2025.
Among the possibilities are:
• Final approval for the FIT-to-FIP switch for Mitsubishi’s Round 1 projects
• Support measures or policy relief for Round 2 and 3 developers (likely, before year-
end)
• Updates to area lease durations, port fee structures, and renewables surcharge
exemptions (the former looks more palatable than the others given the budget
implications of the latter)
• A roadmap for floating wind deployment and a concrete timeline for Round 4
auctions.
If Mitsubishi gives up on some of its R2 projects, it most likely would salvage the Choshi
project off Chiba Prefecture, which has the highest FIT rate and is the most
commercially viable. This would free up Akita sites for re-auction, which while delaying
capacity rollout by a further 2-3 years, could attract new players with more realistic
expectations.

Either way, Japan’s offshore wind market faces the dual challenge of rebuilding trust
while repositioning itself around floating technology. All the stakeholders involved – not
least the officials at METI, MLIT, and MoE – realize that failure to find a compromise
will alienate some industry players and, in a worst case scenario, endanger the entire
offshore wind sector.
The situation is tense, but those with the longer-term lens are already discussing the
next market iterations and the new sea areas that have yet to appear in official
announcements. The groundwork for that is already under way. The sector may now
seem to be at its deepest ebb, but the tide might again soon change, to see better days
ahead.

Energy Jobs in Japan: Building a Workforce for the Hydrogen Economy
Japan’s ¥3 trillion Contracts for Difference (CfD) subsidy program for clean hydrogen
has been heavily oversubscribed, with applications far exceeding the budget according
to METI reports.

Launched by METI in December 2024 and closed in March, the 15-year scheme received
close to 30 applications. METI plans to begin selecting projects on a rolling basis later
this fiscal year, according to Shinichi Kihara, director general for international carbon
neutrality policy.

This reflects a broader global trend, with the IEA predicting a 10x growth in all forms of
hydrogen by 2040, with an increase in green hydrogen estimated to be between 100x to
150x current production.
This is not a linear growth curve; for a hockey-stick curve to be realized, human
resources will face a massive bottleneck if hiring, training and growing the workforce
isn't urgently addressed.

Secure vs borrowed talent
McKinsey & Co. predicts 2 million hydrogen jobs will be needed by 2030, with 30 to
40% located in Asia-Pacific. This contrasts to a current global direct workforce of about
250,000.

To hit this target, the hydrogen industry needs to secure talent. Lets look at the word
‘secure’ – it suggests long-term committed professionals who are trained and specialized.
These are ‘hydrogen people’. Today, few exist and the industry relies on borrowed
talent, professionals with transferable skills. They are trained in another area and
working on hydrogen projects, but may be quickly rotated and shifted out of these.
The think-tank people, economists, bankers and lawyers involved in hydrogen will do
whatever shows promise. Large companies such as major EPCs, trading firms, etc, will
commit talent to hydrogen and related initiatives for as long as they see commercial
success; yet they'll rotate talent out as soon as they feel they won't win projects, or those
projects lack the required profitability. Thus, much of the borrowed talent working on
hydrogen projects today may not be working in the sector tomorrow.
For the hydrogen economy to take off, talent must see, feel and believe in the industry’s
future. This will be shown by individual talent investing in their own education, training
and reskilling to become hydrogen professionals; as well as by talent proactively moving
to companies that win projects or are otherwise committed to continuing to pursue
hydrogen opportunities. Bottom line – if talent is working in hydrogen based on their
employer’s command, rather than their own initiative, the industry will not secure
sufficient workforce.

The real cliff - Execution
In any infrastructure project, the workforce required in the planning and investment
stage is around 10% needed for execution and operations. With the borrowed vs secured
talent argument above, we are focusing primarily on the highly educated talent pool
required for planning and investment. Once projects are approved en masse, we need
people to build them, a lot of people!
21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• White collar talent: Clear policy, bankability, offtake demand, etc, will create
commercial viability that will shift this talent pool to commit to hydrogen.
• Innovation talent: Technological innovation is happening in academia, start-ups
and industrial players already. As with the white collar talent, commercial viability
and demand at scale will drive the innovation industry and related talent.
• Blue collar talent: Hundreds of thousands of engineers, fitters, maintenance
professionals will need to be identified, trained and employed to execute. Unless
building this workforce is addressed prior to establishment of commercial viability,
the need for talent will fall off a cliff.
Why does top talent hesitate?
Recently, at the World Hydrogen Asia event in Tokyo, a constant recurring theme was
the challenge of securing two key factors necessary for clean hydrogen projects to take
off: Project finance, and long-term offtake.
Simply, the challenges in securing these two critical factors demonstrates that major
parts of the industry still have hesitations over the long-term viability of clean hydrogen
and its various downstream use cases that are still largely unproven at commercial scale.

If those in charge of other people’s money are not ready to commit long term, how can
we expect people to stake their own careers and livelihoods long term? I’m not the first
to say this, but those smarter than I need to sort out the economic and thermodynamic
challenges the industry faces before we see a commitment from bankers, offtakers and
workers.

Looking at the mindset of intelligent talent who value their career path, it's clear they'll
choose industries, companies and positions that foster achievements to list on their CV
and add value to professional profiles. This was a frustration for many in offshore wind,
dedicating years to develop a project and preparing a bid, only to lose or worse –for
their company not to bid right before the submission deadline.
Putting the spotlight on one talent segment in high demand right now – Offtake – we
can see hesitation toward hydrogen and its derivatives. An offtake agreement is not
signed in a day. It starts with education, work to get to an LOI, further work and
negotiations to move to MoU. And it takes a lot more to get the talks to term sheet stage
and definitive signed long-term agreements.

In two years in hydrogen, an offtake professional may sign multiple MoUs, however they
are unlikely to close deals. Conversely, had that same professional opted to work in
BESS and renewables space, during that time they would likely have multiple CPPA
deals and a couple of tolling agreements under their belt. You could argue that
hydrogen deals are more complex, but at the end of the day, results and wins on the
board matter.
High barriers to entry and challenges for startups
Unlike simpler segments of the energy industry, hydrogen will require a more highly
skilled, well trained workforce due to safety concerns and technological challenges.

Many of the major/ core players in hydrogen have hired and trained large groups of
young talent. Many investors and developers are large trading houses such as Mitsui,
Sumitomo, and Marubeni that have large pools of talent with plenty of power and
infrastructure experience. Large engineering firms, such as Chiyoda and IHI, are leading
in new technologies and also have large talent pools.


22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

In the mobility and fuel cell sector, players such as Toyota, Honda, and Idemitsu are
long-term supporters of hydrogen technologies. All of these areas, as well as Japanese
EPC firms with extensive experience in LNG infrastructure, are well staffed, trained and
experienced in working on projects both in and outside Japan. Once they are satisfied
with the commercial viability and demand for their projects and technologies, these
firms have the ability to develop internal ‘Centers of Excellence’ and train their
workforce in bulk.
Unlike the solar or even BESS booms, it seems challenging for small to mid-size players
to enter. With already limited talent mobility in Japan for loyalty and cultural reasons,
compounded by a desire to stay with the company that has won projects and invested in
their reskilling, Japanese talent is highly unlikely to move to smaller firms.

Conclusion: Chicken must come before the egg
Japan is betting big on hydrogen and isn't the only country. While projects sit in the
offices of politicians and corporate boardrooms, it can seem progress is made at an
encouraging pace. Once bricks and mortar get involved at scale though, a talent cliff is
looming.
Whether at a company or individual level, if you are bullish about hydrogen, you may
need to invest heavily in talent before it is a sure thing.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Australia / BESS
Grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) discharges hit an all-time quarterly high in the
National Electricity Market, with an average of 162 MW in Q2 of 2025.
China / Clean fuels
Clariant Catalysts and Shanghai Electric have inked a partnership to develop SAF, green
methanol and other renewable energy projects in China.

China / Diesel
China's exports of key refined fuels are on track to jump to the highest in 16 months as refiners
take advantage of rising profit margins, said commodity analysts Kpler.

India / Refinery
Nayara Energy is reducing run rates at its Vadinar refinery as some buyers spurn the refinery
after the EU imposed sanctions. The 400,000 bpd refinery is operating at 80% capacity.
India / Wind power
India has introduced stringent norms for wind turbine equipment makers, requiring them to
source key components domestically and comply with strict data localisation rules.

Indonesia / Nuclear power
Indonesia seeks to launch a nuclear power plant by 2034, and is now drafting and issuing
relevant regulations, and seeking foreign investors.

Malaysia / Nuclear power
Malaysia wants to include nuclear energy in its transition strategy; and the govt completed a
pre-feasibility study on nuclear power, says the Science and Tech ministry.
South Korea / Batteries
LG Energy Solution signed a $4.3 billion contract for supplying batteries to a major
corporation, without naming the customer

Taiwan / Energy security
A Chinese blockade could cut Taiwan’s electrical generating capacity such that the island is
unable to function, said CSIS. “Energy is the weakest element in Taiwan’s resilience against
coercion,” says the American think tank.
