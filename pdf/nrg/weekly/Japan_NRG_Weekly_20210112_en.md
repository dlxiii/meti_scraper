NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY




An update on the COVID situation and measures in Japan
(Japan NRG, Jan .11)
•  As of midnight Jan. 7, Tokyo and its surrounding prefectures have gone into a month-long State of
Emergency (SoE). Osaka, the country’s second-largest metropolitan and industrial area, also
announced an SoE the following day.
•  Several other prefectures asked the national government to expand the SoE to their region. Kyoto
and Hyogo prefectures look set to join Osaka in a SoE from Jan. 13.
•  The SoE conditions are lighter than in most countries since the government lacks strict

enforcement powers. Some conditions are as follows:
•  Citizens are asked not to go out after 8 p.m.
•  All F&B places must shut by 8 p.m., ending alcohol service an hour earlier
•  Goal of 70% reduction in commuter traffic, companies urged to WFH
•  Schools to remain open, university test exams to go ahead as planned
•  Events will still be allowed, but with a limit of 5,000 people as long as that is 50% or less of capacity

(i.e. baseball games can have spectators)
•  Tokyo hit a one-day record of 2,447 new cases on Jan. 7. New infections number was below 1,000
for the whole of 2020, but broke through that level with a sudden spike on Dec. 31.
•  The majority of new infections are among the under 40s.
•  Tokyo has 3,119 patients hospitalized with COVID and, as of Jan. 10, only 4,000 beds allocated for
those afflicted with the virus. Of those in hospital, 129 people are described as in a serious
condition.




Japanese government unveils Green Growth Strategy roadmap for 2050

(Japan NRG, Dec. 25)
•  The govt. published its strategy to meet the goal of net-zero emissions in Japan by 2050. The
strategy stated that its proposals would generation ¥190 trillion ($1.83 trillion) in economic impact.
•  The strategy implied that Japan cannot rely on renewable energy sources for more than 50% to
60% of its electricity because of constraints such as a lack of suitable land space.
•  The plan doesn’t assume zero fossil fuel use in 2050, however, and rather calls for the offsetting of

fossil fuel emissions by planting trees.
•  At a press conference, Prime Minister Suga assured reporters that the roadmap would not hamper
growth.
•  Main points from the Strategy:

Renewables, in general Triple their share in the power generation mix to at least 50% by

2050
Offshore wind power Add 45 GW of capacity by 2040 from negligible levels today
Transportation      Electrify the sector as much as possible; phase out sales of new
gasoline-only cars by 2035, including the “minicars” or light cars, a

timeframe without groundbreaking technological innovation. Japanese automakers lose
international competitiveness unless the entire industry supply chain is able to restructure.
•  CONTEXT: Electric vehicles only use about half as many components as those with a combustion

engine.


Much of Suga’s 2050 net-zero goal depends on carbon capture tech

(Zaiten, January edition)
•  PM Suga set the carbon neutral 2050 goal because 40% of the greenhouse gases in Japan come
from power generation. This will be the focus sector for the government to reduce emissions.
•  Outside energy, Japanese companies will be encouraged to switch raw materials to low-carbon
ones. This is understood as being very difficult and the idea that new low-carbon materials will be
invested is seen as a long shot.
•  Much of Suga government’s 2050 thinking relies on the success of carbon capture technology.

There’s also great expectation for carbon recycling. However, there's uncertainty about the
materials made in this process, and what happens to them when the recycled CO2 is re-processed
as waste. It’s not clear if these materials would release the CO2 used to make them. Similarly, it’s
unclear how well recycling can work over several processing cycles.

•  Japan will need to persuade the rest of the world and take the lead on carbon recycling for this
technology to succeed. Without its own raw materials base, this may be a necessity for Japan.




Govt. wants 60% of offshore wind parts made domestically to drop wind price to ¥8/ kWh
(New Energy Business News, Dec. 22)
•  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism set a goal of increasing the domestic procurement ratio of the offshore
wind supply chain to 60% by 2040 in the draft of their first "Offshore Wind Industry Vision".
•  The vision has four basic strategies: creation of an attractive domestic market, investment

promotion / supply chain formation, next-gen technology development with an eye to expand into

agreements with generators.
•  While TEPCO EP has yet to decide specifically which generators it will ditch, it is expected that
most of those affected will be thermal power stations.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
ENEOS emerges as “buyer” of TEPCO Energy Partner
(Zaiten, January edition)

o  CONTEXT: TEPCO Energy Partner is the electricity retail company inside the Tokyo
Electric Power Co. Holdings.
o  TEPCO Energy Partner has lost revenue for five straight years and is now in a dire
situation. To cut costs, the company is reorganizing contracts with suppliers and going
paperless, as well as raising its prices.
o  The company has managed to survive until now in the hope of a dramatic turnaround in
revenue at TEPCO group from the restart of the Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant

(NPP). However, TEPCO has not yet gained approval for the restart from local politicians,
and timing remains unclear.
o  TEPCO Energy Partner also risks reporting a loss this fiscal year. Lenders and its holding
company are pushing the company to improve earnings and further cut costs.
o  The company is likely soon to be sold since the METI has finally decided to get serious
about dismantling the TEPCO group.
o  ENEOS is emerging as the potential buyer. TEPCO President Kobayakawa has recently

met with ENEOS chairman Sugimori several times.



Fukushima: TEPCO to delayed removal of fuel debris from reactors 1 and 2

(M Data, Dec. 23)

CONTACT US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Tokyo Electric Power Company is postponing the removal of debris from reactor No. 2 at the
Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant after tests of a robotic arm set to take place in the UK were
cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
•  TEPCO is instead making arrangements to test the robotic arm in Japan. The debris removal is the

greatest hurdle facing the decommissioning operation. The delay is for at least a year.



TEPCO invests in grid to help renewables and deflect criticism from high reliance on coal

(Jan. 2, Newswitch)
•  Slow progress in restarting nuclear reactors means that much of Japan’s electricity is currently
generated from coal. This has sparked criticism overseas, and it is unclear how long Japan will be
able to sustain its current level of coal use.
•  While tariffs paid to generators under the FIT scheme have tumbled from ¥48 per kilowatt hour in
2009 to only ¥14 in 2019, Japan now has 78 GW of FIT-approved renewable generation capacity
(including capacity under construction). When adding wind farms under construction this more or
less is enough to meet the government’s 2030 target of 22%.
•  TEPCO Power Grid recently responded to the growth in solar farms in Chiba by investing ¥130

billion in upgrading transmission infrastructure. TEPCO hopes that by diversifying electricity
sources to include renewables, it will be able to deflect criticism of its fossil fuel use.



KEPCO crisis prompts TEPCO to propose restructuring of nuclear operations

(Diamond, Jan. 7)
•  On Dec. 18, Kansai Electric Power Co. (KEPCO) CEO Morimoto Takashi held a conference to
announce his company’s intention to send nuclear waste to a new storage facility being built in
Mutsu (Aomori prefecture), with the agreement of the local community.
•  The announcement was made in response to an order issued by METI minister Kajiyama in July
that demanded generators to improve their arrangements for disposing of nuclear waste.

Improved waste disposal was of course merely a pretext—in reality, the government is trying to
assist KEPCO, which currently lacks interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel.
•  The governor of Fukui, a region that’s home to all 11 of KEPCO’s reactors, has ordered the
company to make a shortlist of 20 potential sites for interim storage facilities outside of Fukui.
•  Fuel rod storage pools attached to the Mihama and Ooi plants could reach capacity by as early as
2025 and 2027, respectively.
•  TEPCO has invited KEPCO to share its Mutsu storage facility.
•  According to energy market analysts, in return for the favor, TEPCO is pressuring KEPCO to

participate more actively in a nuclear industry lobby group whose members includes the Tohoku
and Chubu Electric utilities, KEPCO, and Hitachi. Nicknamed the “Higashi-Dori Seven”, the
conglomerate’s agenda is to restructure Japan’s nuclear sector.

Arguments for KEPCO reactor restart shot down by court decision (editorial)

(Dec. 19, Business Journal)

o  A recent Osaka District Court decision found failings in the process followed by the
Nuclear Regulation Authority when reviewing the application to restart Units 3 and 4 at
the Ohi nuclear power plant.
o  The decision has destroyed the power company’s claim that the reactors meet Japan’s
post-Fukushima safety standards, the strictest in the world.

o  The court criticized KEPCO’s calculations, which only demonstrated the reactors’ ability
to withstand an earthquake of average size. The Authority’s guidelines stipulate that
reactors must also be able to withstand unusually large earthquakes.
o  KEPCO and the Authority were dismissive of the plaintiff’s arguments, which they
regarded as ill-informed. However, while claiming that the reactors satisfied the world’s
strictest safety criteria, then Authority chair Tanaka Shun’ichi also shirked responsibility,

saying he couldn't categorically guarantee the plant’s safety.
o  The nuclear lobby’s attitude has come back to bite them. The loss is an unprecedented
setback for both KEPCO and the government.
o  However, decisions unfavorable to the nuclear industry have historically been overturned
on appeal by high court judges keen to appease the government.




Prime Minister’s key backer, Nikai, key to TEPCO nuclear plant restart
(Diamond, Jan. 7)
•  Restarting the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) would be extremely lucrative for
TEPCO, with each reactor generating over ¥10 billion annual revenue.
•  Any restart will need the consent of local residents, according to a “gentlemen’s agreement”

between the heads of the local municipality and the government.
•  Niigata Governor Hanazumi notably worked under LDP Secretary-General Nikai when the latter
was Transport Minister. Nikai is seen as having significant influence over the governor.
•  Hanazumi will stand for re-election in June 2022 with a platform that includes restarting the
Kashiwazaki plant.
•  To avoid the negative publicity associated with TEPCO, the government has proposed the plant be

sold to a quango, provisionally named “East Japan Atomic Power”, in which the Japan Atomic
Power Company would hold a stake, thereby enabling the plant to drop the TEPCO brand.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan current has just three reactors in operation and all of these are in the Kyushu prefecture,
the westernmost of the main islands of Japan. Efforts to restart nuclear reactors in the key industrial area of
Kansai have stalled for now and progress in the areas north of Tokyo is slow. The nuclear industry may need to
wait until after the March 11 anniversary of the nuclear accident at Fukushima to build up momentum and
persuade the skeptical public.

LNG prices surge to all-time records as Japan and neighbors go through cold snap
(Japan NRG, Jan. 11)
•  Bids for spot LNG cargoes jumped to around $30/ mmbtu, according to S&P Platts data, and the
Japan-Korea Marker (JKM), a leading Asian LNG benchmark, broke through the $21/ mmbtu level.
Both are all-time records. Kyushu Electric purchased a Jan. delivery cargo in the mid-$30s.
•  The price increase follows a wave of cold temperatures across Japan, China and South Korea. The

cold snap saw parts of China experience lowest temperatures in over 50 years; South Korea’s peak
power demand is rising; and Japanese utilities are struggling to secure enough electricity supply.
•  Higher cost of fuel had a knock-on effect on Japanese electricity prices, which spiked at ¥117.39
per kilowatt-hour on Jan. 11 for day-ahead 24-hour pricing. The average for 2020 was ¥6.43/ kWh.
The price has never breached ¥100.
•  Japan’s power grid oversight body, OCCTO, and Tokyo Electric Power Co. asked businesses and
homes to be conservative with their energy consumption. Demand was up 14% in early January.

•  CONTEXT: The reasons for the price spike in Asian LNG are various and the cold temperatures are
only part of the story.
o  There has been a shortage of LNG carrying vessels in the global market over the last
month or so
o  Several LNG projects in Australia, Malaysia and the Middle East had to delay production
or shipping recently due to technical issues and this has added to a tightness of supply in

the market
o  U.S. LNG exports to Asia have been constrained by extra coronavirus prevention
procedures
o  Japan’s LNG inventories are only built to secure about two weeks of supply and a sudden
surge in demand can quickly drain the volumes; plus, the fuel is technically hard to store
for longer periods
o  Several nuclear reactors in Japan that were expected to be online are not due to a citizen-

group led court injunction and unplanned repairs
o  Snowfall even in the southern main island of Japan covered solar panels, limiting output

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Tokyo grid operator asks non-utilities to supply electricity to avert blackouts
(Nikkei, Jan. 6)
o  Tepco Power Grid, a unit of Tokyo Electric Power Co. Holdings, has asked non-utilities

that have private power generation equipment to help bring more supply into the system
as the most-populated area of the country faces shortages.
o  Steel, chemical and oil companies have some generation facilities that power their
factories. Tepco Power Grid is asking these firms to sell any surplus.
o  CONTEXT: The last time the grid operator asked non-utilities to contribute was in 2011,
after a major earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s northeast and led to most
nuclear power plants being taken offline.

o  Power demand in December was about 4% higher than a year ago.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kyushu Electric asks other utilities for electricity for the first time

o  The utility for the Kyushu region said demand is exceeding supply at peak hours due to
heating

o  CONTEXT: This follows a similar request from four other regional power utilities the
previous day

Takeuchi: Japan should declare a power emergency
(Nikkei, Jan. 8)
o  Takeuchi Sumiko, Director and Chief Researcher at 21st Century Public Policy Institute, a
public policy think tank of the big-business lobby Keidanren, writes an opinion column for

Nikkei.
o  Takeuchi’s column suggests that Japan may have been better served by long-term LNG
contracts, securing supply, and thermal and nuclear generation. Moving to more spot
LNG trading, relying on intermittent sources such as solar, and opening up the market to
competition has done little to make sure there is adequate power supply at this critical
time, according to Takeuchi.
• TAKEAWAY: While the temperatures are forecast to flip to warmer than average within a week, expect the

debate about energy supply security in Japan to reignite and the conservative lobby to raise the arguments as
per the one cited above.

Petrochemical industry forced to make radical changes
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Dec. 29)
•  The Japanese government’s declaration to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 is forcing the

petrochemical industry to diversify the range of services offered at petrol stations as decline in
demand for gasoline seems unavoidable.
•  Petroleum Association of Japan chair (and chair of ENEOS Holdings) Sugimori Tsutomu has said
the Association plans to beef up its long-term low carbon vision, which was released in May 2019
and does not currently set any specific targets.
•  Sugimori also said he wants to include hydrogen and other synthetic “e-fuels” in the vision, and
boost awareness of hydrogen.
•  Higher uptake of hydrogen is reliant on the availability of cheap, carbon neutral hydrogen, either

through electrolysis of water using electricity generated by renewable means or the gasification of
lignite.



Tokyo Gas CEO pushes back against calls for all-electric infrastructure

(Asahi Shimbun, Dec. 29)
•  Tokyo Gas CEO Uchida Takashi has criticized the government’s proposal for achieving net zero
emissions by 2050, saying that the government will be unable to achieve its goals through
renewables and electric infrastructure alone.
•  Reticulated gas must be part of the solution, says Uchida, who claims gas has a role to play in
complementing electric technologies. The CEO also highlighted the importance of redundancy in

the energy network, citing recent power outages.
•  Tokyo Gas has pledged to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions group-wide sometime before
2050.

ANALYSIS


BY MAYUMI WATANABE

In the Background of China-U.S. Tensions,
Japan-China Green Technology Collaboration Strengthens


While U.S.-China tensions remain high, Japan’s energy relationship with its powerful
neighbor remains robust and will continue to strengthen. An end-of-year energy
forum between Japan and China that went largely unnoticed saw top officials from
both sides outline areas of potential collaboration. Also, Japanese businesses signed
14 agreements with Chinese partners, including in the fields of carbon recycling and
hydrogen.

Note, all 14 of these agreements concerned the entry of Japanese firms into the
Chinese market, and none were vice versa. An official from Japan’s Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) exclusively revealed that while Japan-China ties
will be impacted by worsening U.S.-China relations, the partnerships in green tech will
remain resilient because of the relations built up by the private sector over the past
decade.

The Japan-China Forum on Energy Conservation and Environment has taken place
every year since 2006, yet it has never been as relevant as during the recent Dec. 20,
2020 edition. Just months earlier, China’s premier Xi Jinping declared his country will
be carbon neutral by 2060. Soon after, Prime Minister Suga said Japan will achieve
net-zero emissions a decade earlier, in 2050. South Korean president Moon Jae-in
followed days later, promising that his country will be carbon neutral by 2050.
The forum, sometimes referred to as the Japan-China Green Forum, started life as a
platform for Japanese firms to apply their technologies to help combat China’s
pollution, and it enjoys strong backing both from the state and private sectors. The
forum is just one example of how Japan-China business ties remains strong.

Japan’s METI minister Kajiyama delivered a clear message at the forum that this
progress needs to continue, and that among a dozen green technologies, hydrogen
and carbon recycling are of highest importance for the two countries.

Zhang Wen Jiang, who heads the science and technology unit of CHN Energy,
echoed Kajiyama. “Why we cooperate…Japan and China have a combined 40%
global share of hydrogen production…65% of fuel cell vehicles in the world are in this
region…we can standardize technologies through joint developments of solid oxide
fuel cells, gas turbines and fuel cells,” he said in his presentation.

The METI official said the 14 agreements signed for bilateral green projects was a
landmark achievement, and they add to the more than 400 energy JVs launched since
2006 between the two countries. These span energy conservation, pollution control,
and other areas.

Projects signed at the 2020 Japan-China Green Forum (Extract)

o  Marubeni-JGC-Juhua joint venture on the reuse of hydrogen, a byproduct of Juhua’s caustic soda
and other plants, as a fuel to generate power and as a material for polymer electrolyte fuel cells.
The power generators and the fuel cells will have a test-run at Juhua’s chemical plants.

o  Japan Coal Energy Center, Hitachi Zosen, Shaanxi-Yulin Economic Development Zone on testing
Hitachi Zosen’s carbon recycling techy, assessing the costs of running facilities and their returns,
and how the technology fits in the energy supply chain. Studies to take place in 2021-2022.

o  Japan’s Global Consortium for Energy and Environment (GCFEN)-China Hunan Taohuajiang
Nuclear Power Company on production of hydrogen using solar energy

o  Japan’s CMI Corporation and Jilin International Power Investment to share data on use of
hydrogen in renewables

The last two projects didn’t reveal details because they’re confidential, officials said.
One Japanese company said the government hasn’t allocated any money for the
project, and companies are able to develop businesses on their own in China. There
are no investment or trade barriers in China to launch hydrogen projects.

Japan classifies the energy sector as vital to national security, and under the Foreign
Exchange and Trade Act, foreign investors need to clear regulatory reviews by the
Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan if they want to hold more than a 1% stake in
any energy company, public or private. The regulatory process is even more rigorous
for foreign state-owned companies, and many Chinese players are state-owned.

Of course, the most important Japan-China hydrogen project of the year was
presented well ahead of the December forum. In June, Toyota Motor announced that
it was forming an R&D joint venture with four Chinese automakers to develop
commercial vehicle fuel cell systems in China.

As is often the case with Toyota, it both supports government initiatives and pursues
its own path. Toyota’s Chinese JV falls outside the government-led collaboration
program, but the automaker contributed to the forum by delivering a presentation on
its new Mirai hydrogen passenger car, released only 11 days earlier.

The upgraded Mirai milestones included: cutting production costs to one-third of the
first model, and increasing hydrogen volume by 21% while increasing travel distance
by 30%. Toyota plans annual production of over 1 million Mirai and EVs by 2030.

This kind of tech and ambition is valuable for China. The country had just 2,000
hydrogen vehicles in 2019, but the government plans to increase this to 50,000
vehicles by 2025 and 1.3 million vehicles by 2035. Unlike Japan, China sees more of a
use for hydrogen in buses and trucks, rather than passenger vehicles.

The four bilateral hydrogen and carbon recycling projects are just the tip of the
iceberg, and many more Japan-China JVs are expected to be launched outside of
government purview. For example, Japanese manufacturers of fuel cell battery
components, and their suppliers in lower tiers, are expected to soon launch new
ventures in China. The success of these JVs will prove vital for both countries to justify
forging ahead with hydrogen and carbon recycling.

2021: The Events that Will Impact Japan’s Energy Policy Trajectory

2021 is expected to be a momentous year for Japan’s energy planners as they are
forced to flesh out commitments to meet carbon neutrality by 2050.

A revised mid-term energy mix vision and, based on that, refreshed emission targets
will likely be the most important announcements from the Japanese authorities this
year. Japan needs to firm up on the country’s near-term emissions plans for 2025 and
2030 as part of the nationally determined contributions submission that will be officially
presented at the November COP26 meeting in Glasgow.

These are a number of other key events and dates in 2021 that will be important
milestones for Japan’s future energy policies. We compile the list and include
international events where Japan may participate and/or where we believe climate and
energy security will be important agenda items.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Oil & Gas:
1). Oil benchmarks re-established footholds above $50 last week with the surprising
outcome from the OPEC+ meeting when Saudi Arabia agreed to a unilateral
production cut of 1 million bpd in February and March 2021. WTI closed at $51 on
Friday and Brent at $56. Russia and Kazakhstan will marginally increase production.

2). Write-downs by EU and U.S. oil and gas companies reached $145 billion in the first
three quarters of 2020 equivalent to 10% of their market values.

3). Fitch, the credit rating agency, are predicting $15-$18 billion of energy related
high-yield bond U.S. defaults in 2021, the most of any sector. High-yield bond
defaults in the U.S. energy sector in 2020 were $48 billion.

Transportation/EVs/Autonomous Vehicles:
1). Some market analysts predicted last week that Apple, China!s Baidu, and Foxconn
could enter the autonomous and EV transportation market. Tesla!s market value
exceeded $830 billion last week with Morgan Stanley now forecasting that EV sales
will rise by 50% in 2021. One analyst even recommended that Tesla purchase GM.

2). Italy!s Fiat Chrysler will merge with France!s PSA Peugeot to create the fourth
largest auto company after Toyota, VW, and Renault-Nissan. The new company is
expected to generate sales of $5 billion annually, with a production capacity of 8.7
million vehicles.

Shipping:
The EU is examining plans to bring the 60,000-vessel global shipping industry into its
Emissions Trading System ("ETS!), which might require Asian shippers to pay ETS tariffs
on EU dockings.

China:
Over 12 Chinese cities across four provinces, including Hunan, imposed restrictions on
electricity consumption due to shortages of thermal coal caused mainly by a blockade
on Australian thermal coal imports.

South Korea:
Ssangyong Motors filed for bankruptcy due to a liquidity shortfall. Creditor banks
include JP Morgan, Bank of America and BNP Paribas. Ssangyong is 75% owned by
India!s automobile company Mahindra & Mahindra.

Indonesia:
The government is expected to commence a second round of fund-raising for its new
sovereign wealth fund in late January. The first round raised $16 billion. Canadian and
Dutch pension funds might invest in the second round.

India:
ArcelorMittal, the world!s largest steel producer, has announced that it will construct
an electric arc furnace with Japan!s Nippon Steel in Alabama as part of a 50:50 joint
venture. U.S. steel prices have risen 70% in the last three months.

Pakistan:
1). Pakistan suffered a nation-wide power blackout on Saturday caused by a plunge in
the frequency of the power transmission system. The outage impacted over 200
million citizens and all major cities.

2). Pakistan will commence construction of a 1,100 km natural gas pipeline to Russia in
July as part of plans to increase LNG imports.

3). Last week, 11 coal miners were killed in an Islamic terrorist attack in southwestern
Baluchistan at the Machh coalfield 48 km east of Quetta.

Iraq:
Iraq chose ZhenHua Oil Co., a subsidiary of China!s largest state-owned defense
contractor, for a multibillion-dollar oil-supply prepayment contract.

Iran:
The IRGC seized the South Korean (RoK) tanker, Hankuk Chemi, near Hormuz on
Monday, arresting five RoK sailors. An RoK delegation has been in Tehran since
Thursday and a vice-minister is expected to join the negotiations. RoK is thought to
be holding $7 billion in bank accounts subject to oil-related sanctions restrictions.

Qatar:
Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries announced an end to the three-year blockade
of Qatar and will end air, land, and sea restrictions, as well as restore diplomatic
relations. The border between Saudi Arabia and Qatar was opened on Friday and
flights between Doha and Riyadh resumed on Monday. Qatar is a major supplier of
LNG to Japan.

Africa:
Total, the French oil and gas company, partially evacuated its LNG facility in Cabo
Delgado in Northern Mozambique last week due to Islamic terrorist attacks. The $20
billion project is the largest private sector investment in Africa. Mitsui Tdg. has a 20%
interest in the project and $16 billion in financing was arranged last summer mainly
from Japanese private sector banks with a $3 billion commitment from JBIC. The
project is expected to produce 13 million tons of LNG annually.

Serbia:
The Balkan country opened a 400 km section of the Turkish Stream pipeline that will
transport Russian gas to Serbia through Bulgaria and Turkey. Serbia ruled against LNG
from the U.S. on concerns about cost.

Spain:
Japan!s ORIX will acquire 80% of Elawan, a Spanish renewable power company that
operates over 700 MW of projects, for around $1 billion.

France:
Engie, the French clean energy group that’s 25% controlled by the French state,
announced plans to sell assets in 2021 that could impact one-third of its workforce.

Denmark:
Vestas, the wind turbine manufacturer, will invest $500 million in an Energy Transition
Fund that in turn will finance new global wind energy projects in a tie-up with
Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.

Italy:
Eni, the Italian oil company, announced it will reduce its breakeven oil price to the
#low 40s” in order to cope with increased volatility in oil prices.

U.K:
1). Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) will take an additional $4.5 billion asset write-down charge
in Q4 on a Gulf of Mexico oilfield project, a refinery closure, and out-of-the-money
LNG contracts. This is incremental to $18 billion of write-downs that RDS already
announced in FY2020.

2). Alok Sharma has resigned as U.K business minister to become full-time President
of COP26 which will be the largest summit the U.K. has ever hosted.

Americas:
1) TerraPower, a manufacturer of molten salt reactors backed by Bill Gates, is
partnering with Southern Company, a U.S. utility, and Core Power in the U.K.
and France!s Orano, to build a scaled down version of a molten salt reactor that could
be used for maritime transportation.

2) Cisco, the U.S. technology infrastructure company, will terminate its Cisco Kinetic
for Cities investment vehicle that was supposed to invest in Smart City infrastructure
as part of a restructuring plan.

3) Smithfields Foods in Missouri is planning to sell biogas from its farm operations as
part of a renewable energy initiative that will generate renewable-fuel credits. Biogas
could reach 10% to 30% of total U.S. natural gas supply by 2040.

2020: The Year that Attitudes to Climate Change Finally Changed

And Renewables Staked Their Claim as the Top Energy Sector

The year 2020 will be remembered as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic. But it will
also go into the history books as the year when disruption of the energy sector took
off, avoiding the threat of rapid climate change.

Though few paid much attention, a number of important peaks were achieved in the
past decade: peak nuclear in 2006; peak coal in 2013; peak oil extraction in 2018;
peak fossil-fuel electricity in 2018; and peak CO2 emissions in 2019. It's possible that
some of these peaks might be reached again in coming years, but chances are that
they won't.

Power production
Global fossil fuel consumption decreased significantly in 2020. Fossil-fuel generated
electricity production decreased for the second consecutive year, posting its largest
decrease ever. Nuclear power also decreased as some amortised reactors shut due to
uncompetitiveness. Only renewable electricity production continued to increase. But
these are not only temporary reductions in production. Coal-fired stations and nuclear
reactors are shut around the world and fewer new constructions are started.
In Europe, India and the U.S., fossil fuel and nuclear-generated electricity decreased
and only renewable-generated electricity increased. All sorts of electricity production
may have increased in China, but renewables growth outpaced all other sectors of
electricity production.


Despite Trump's rhetoric supporting coal, economic competitiveness drives real world
developments. In the U.S., renewables provided more electricity than coal for the first
time since the 19th century. Also, renewables topped nuclear power for the first time
since 1984.
Global solar and wind energy capacity continued to increase, adding around 200 GW
in 2020 alone. That added capacity is equivalent to half of total global nuclear
capacity in operation.

In October, South Australia reported its first hour of generating 100% of electricity
from solar power, while in December the country had a whole day with 99.6% solar
and wind electricity. In Germany, wind power alone contributed more electricity than
hard coal and lignite combined in 2020.

Cost development
Solar and wind-generated electricity are now the cheapest source for new electricity
generating capacity almost everywhere in the world. In 2020 they are cheaper than
any other electricity technology in history. Cost reductions continued as the industry
learned from experience and as economies of scale gave further advantages.

The real-world progress of 2020 is closely related to the industrial progress now seen
to have resolved some of the most relevant problems hindering the future of
renewable energy. Mobile phones, laptop computers and, more recently, electric
vehicles have created the demand that has facilitated battery industry to lower costs,
learning by experience and scaling up production.
Meanwhile, in countries far from the equator and where solar seasonal variation is
large or reliance on wind energy requires larger storage capacity, hydrogen and other
electro-fuels offer great opportunities. This is possible as renewable-generated
electricity has become cheaper than oil per unit of energy content. This is sometimes
also true for natural gas and even for coal when carbon emissions are priced in.

Low cost renewables and the industrialisation of a range of hydrolysis technologies
make renewable hydrogen a feasible alternative, substituting petroleum as a fuel, or
coal and natural gas in industrial processes.

Technology creates tipping points
The Hornsdale Tesla battery in Australia was more effective in stabilising the electricity
grid at lower cost than traditional generating systems. In 2020 this experience was
reproduced as stabilising services were procured in Europe. Electrolysers may
supplement batteries offering flexibility along the time scale, improving economic
benefits of hydrogen production beyond just substituting for fossil fuels.

Battery costs have fallen to such an extent that solar electricity and batteries can
provide competitive and continuous electricity for a growing number of consumers
across the globe.

Reactions from Industry and the financial community
Perhaps more decisive for the energy sector is the apparent foresight displayed by
major oil companies such as BP and Shell. When announcing their forecasts for
decreased demand, telling shareholders that they will invest in renewables while
spending less on sourcing oil, they reassured their financial backers. But this came as a
huge shock to other players in the oil industry.

The financial sector has learned from years of experience that there are risks in fossil
fuel energy and non-renewables; and such risks can now lead to big financial losses. In
the last five years, the five largest coal mining companies in the U.S. have gone
bankrupt. In 2020, some of the most prominent U.S. companies in the shale gas
industry also filed for bankruptcy.
As a result, financial institutions have started to avoid new fossil fuel investments and
are divesting from this sector. For a sector used to easy access to capital this poses
new challenges and will further reduce competitiveness. Big Finance is changing the
energy landscape, and renewables is now the place to make money.


Reactions from the political system
The renewables sector was initially supported by government policies, and public
support came from a desire to avoid nuclear reactor disasters, fight climate change
and end dependence on oil imports. Denmark initiated wind power developments,
later supported by the U.S., Germany and China. The U.S., Germany and China led
industrial development in solar PV, an industry where Japan was the early front-
runner.

This success has made it easier for today’s political leaders to embrace bold
ambitions, and such ambitions came true in 2020.
Joe Biden winning the 2020 U.S. election is a victory for renewable energy. In
September, Xi Jinping announced that China will be carbon neutral by 2060. Not to
be outdone, one month later Japan’s new prime minister Yoshihide Suga, claimed
Japan would be carbon-neutral by 2050. South Korea and Australian states have done
the same, together showing Pacific-Asian leadership on the issue of climate.

The EU Green Deal is the most decisive effort ever from the European Community
outlining a ”Green Growth” scenario and making significant funding avaliable. This
has inspired Poland, long one of Europe’s most coal dependent countries, to make a
leap forward in 2020, with deputy minister Adam Guibourgé-Czetwertynski stating in
September that his country was committed to carbon neutrality and would transform
its entire economy toward that goal.
Europe has also dramatically increased its ambitions for CO2 reductions between
2019 and 2030 from a 40% cut to 55%.


Challenges remain, but the hope is growing
Nevertheless, challenges remain. Some fossil fuel companies still have resources in
the form of loyal politicians. First Energy in Ohio is just one such example. That case
involved $60 million in bribes to politicians to convince them to have Ohio residents
foot a $1 billion bill that would allow the company to keep its nuclear and coal
stations operational.
Governments will continue to support nuclear energy as a way of securing knowledge,
equipment and materials they need to have the nuclear weapon capability they
desire.

Despite these challenges, one thing is certain - the global energy system changed
drastically in 2020. Energy statistics are clear about this. In addition, some major
energy companies, financial institutions, governments and key international
organisations have embraced a common vision of the future.
For those countries and companies that fail to keep up with the energy transition, the
year 2020 may become less about the COVID-19 pandemic and more about the time
they lost control of their economic future.
