NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Japan and U.S. set out terms for climate action partnership

(Japan NRG, April 18)
•  Terms of the U.S. Japan Climate Partnership can be found here, with the wider cooperation terms
included under the aegis of resilience and available here.
•  Main takeaway of the partnership seems to be the shift in attention from the 2050 timeline for
decarbonization to “taking decisive action by 2030”.
•  Both countries expected to announce shortly amended Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs) – i.e., the scope of emission cuts they will undertake by 2030. The U.S. is said to be

pushing for a 50% cut for itself and its close allies, including Japan.
•  Mutual focus will be on renewable energy, batteries and other form of “long-duration energy
storage”, smart grids, hydrogen, carbon capture technology, and carbon recycling.
•  Advanced nuclear power is included in the list of cooperation areas and will likely refer to Small
Modular Reactors (SMRs) that the U.S. has been developing over the past decade or so.
•  CONTEXT: Japan’s JGC Corp earlier this month announced an investment in NuScale, the most
advanced U.S. company in terms of realizing SMR projects. The Japanese engineering firm will also

work with NuScale on its SMR construction in Idaho.
•  Importantly, the two countries agreed on supporting “realistic transition paths” for developing
economies in the Indo-Pacific region. That likely references support for LNG as a transition fuel.
•  A key topic that is noticeably missing from the Climate Partnership document is carbon pricing / a
tax on CO2. Both countries are still studying the best way to introduce pricing on carbon and
building industry support for it. We would expect some form of agreement on this to come later in
the year and for the EU to play an important role in it.




Japan auto group sees EVs accounting for 20%-30% of new car sales in 2030

(Japan NRG, April 16)
•  Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) made a presentation to METI, in which it
outlined the industry’s vision for decarbonization.
•  JAMA said securing supply of low-cost, carbon-neutral electricity is one of their biggest issues and
appealed for government policy and financial aid on this.
•  EVs made up just 0.5% of total new car sales in FY2019, with plugin hybrids (PHEV) accounting for

another 0.4%. The two categories should account for 20%-30% of total sales by FY2030, JAMA
forecast.
•  Fuel cell cars (FCV) made up 0.02% of FY2019 sales, or just 70,000 units. By FY2030, that share will
rise to about 3%, JAMA said.
•  Hybrid vehicles are expected to retain their 34% share over the next decade to cover 30%-40% of
total sales, with green diesel also expected to increase its presence to 5%-10% of total.
•  Gasoline cars are expected to account for 30% to 50% of total new sales by FY2030, down from

61% in FY2019, JAMA forecast.

• TAKEAWAY: With Japan set to ban sales of new gasoline cars from 2035 and Tokyo area from 2030, it’s
surprising to see gasoline’s share at such a high level in a decade. Most likely, the industry is trying to dampen
expectations and play for time as it tests a switch to EVs, and to a lesser extent FCVs.





Carbon emissions from the energy sector dropped 3.4% in FY2019
(Japan NRG, April 16)
•  METI has published figures for energy supply and demand for the fiscal year between April 2019
and March 2020 (FY2019).
•  Final energy consumption fell 2.5% YoY.
•  Oil consumption was down 2.5%, coal down 2.1%, power down 1.9% YoY.
•  Power generation dropped 2.4%; share of non-fossil power was 24.3% of total, increasing for the

seventh straight year; nuclear’s contribution at lowest level in five years.
•  Carbon emissions from the energy sector fell 3.4% to 1.03 billion tons of CO2.



New Battery Alliance vows to deliver policy goals to govt. by May

(Japan NRG, April 15)
•  The newly established Japanese Battery Association for Supply Chain (BASC), headed by
Sumitomo Metal Executive Officer Abe Isao, held its inaugural meeting on April 14. More than 50
Japanese firms attended, almost double the expected number, amid rising industry concern about
the sourcing of raw materials for the wider rollout of batteries for EVs and energy storage.
•  The alliance made a presentation to a METI and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism committee. In it, the alliance asked for more comprehensive battery-related policies,

pointing to Japan’s weakening industrial competitiveness, supply chain issues, and high energy
prices. The alliance also warned about increasing cobalt, lithium, and other core raw material
prices.
•  The BASC intends to make its policy proposals for subsidies to the government by May.
•  CONTEXT: The government is expected to announce a new mid/long-term energy mix vision for
the country this summer.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s GDP growth over the last two decades owes much to the automaking sector. The

domestic companies, however, are somewhat behind in the move away from gasoline engine vehicles and will
be in a strong position to petition large funds from the state to help them catch up and retain their global
competitiveness. Batteries could also play a major role in the energy mix. The alliance may be leaving it late to
have a strong influence on the latest iteration of the long-term energy mix that METI will publish this summer.
But, arguably batteries may have a bigger role to play in Japan’s energy mix than hydrogen, at least in the
next decade.

Renewable energy adoption to exceed targets by up to 14% by 2030: METI
(Kankyo Business, April 9)
•  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on April 7 that it projects Japan’s total
renewable energy capacity to reach 2.71 terawatt hours by 2030/31.

•  This represents a 14% increase over the 2.37 TW hours the government set as the lower end of its
target range.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Growth of renewable energy brings challenges
(NHK, April 13)
o  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has said that while Japan will generate over

40% more renewable electricity by 2030, land suitable for solar farms is fast running out.
o  A select committee convened on April 13 to discuss mid-to long-term energy policy
calculated that if disused agricultural land can be commandeered for solar power
generation as well, it will be possible to boost renewable electricity capacity by some
56% by 2030.
o  As land suitable for solar farms becomes increasingly scarce, however, there is also a
need to join forces with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport to encourage

more homeowners to install solar panels, said the committee.



Syouei Create and Marubeni plan giant solar farm for Laos
(Kankyo Business, April 12)
•  Syouei Create said on April 8 that it had signed a deal with a major Thai investment fund to build

two solar farms in Laos with a combined output of 981 MW.
•  Work on the plant will begin in May, and the plant is due to begin supplying the grid in March
2023.
•  Funding for the project was provided by the SEF Group of Singapore.



Mitsubishi Heavy and Osaka Gas invest in Green ammonia start-up

(Kankyo Business, April 13)
•  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Osaka Gas said on April 9 that they had invested in U.S.-based
start-up Starfire Energy, which is developing a system to synthesize carbon-free “green” ammonia
from air and water.
•  Mitsubishi and Osaka Gas are joined by the likes of UK venture capital fund AP Ventures, Chevron
Technology Ventures, and Australian investment fund New Energy Technology in investing in

Starfire.
•  Founded in 2007, Starfire develops small-scale, distributed green ammonia synthesis modules, as
well as technology for breaking down ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen.

METI threatens to revoke licenses of solar operators that break fencing rules
(Smart Japan, April 8)
•  The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy issued a repeated warning about the need to erect
fencing and signage around solar farms participating in the feed-in tariff scheme.

•  Fences need to be high enough and robust enough to prevent members of the public from
entering facilities, and fences need to be a reasonable distance from panels.
•  Operators that do not comply with this requirement could have their license revoked, said the
Agency.




TEPCO and Toray set up joint business to handle green hydrogen
(Denki Shimbun, April 16)
•  Yamanashi Prefecture, Tokyo Electric (TEPCO), and Toray Industries announced the creation of a
joint company to develop a business in green hydrogen.
•  The venture will supply and retail hydrogen made with renewable energy inside and outside
Yamanashi prefecture using a power-to-gas (P2G) system that produces hydrogen with electricity.
At first, the venture will supply hydrogen to local factories and supermarkets at a test level.

•  The entity will be set up this year and begin full operations in FY2022.
•  The three parties started construction of a P2G facility at the Yonekurayama Solar Power Plant
(Kofu City) in FY2016. This facility can generate 400 normal m3 of hydrogen per hour.
•  The venture will also seek government funds from the newly established green growth fund.



Itochu Enex to boost synthetic diesel use

(Nikkei Business Daily, April 16)
•  Fuel trader Itochu Enex plans to expand sales of gas to liquid (GTL) synthetic diesel, currently only
available in Kansai, Kanto, and Chubu, to Kyushu as well.
•  Itochu Enex will principally market the fuel to construction companies.
•  The trader aims to achieve a five-fold increase in the volume of the fuel it sells to 100,000 kL/year
by 2023/24.
•  Construction machinery manufacturers Caterpillar and Hitachi have given GTL diesel, which has a

lower carbon footprint and is also responsible for less atmospheric pollution, their stamp of
approval.



Osaka Gas plans biomass power station for Miyazaki

(Sankei Biz, April 16)
•  Osaka Gas said on April 15 it would build a biomass fired power station in Miyazaki.
•  The 50 MW plant will cost ¥35 billion to build and is due to begin supplying the grid in 2024.

Antitrust agency accuses Japanese utilities of cartel behavior in power, gas
(Denki Shimbun, April 14)
•  Japan’s antitrust agency suspects several major electricity and gas providers in western Japan of
cartel-like behavior.
•  Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) started inspections of five companies including Chubu

Electric, Toho Gas, Kansai Electric, and Chugoku Electric. The JFCT is probing them for potentially
violating the Antimonopoly Act and colluding in the sale of electricity and gas.
•  The officials suspect the firms conspired to fix prices for household electricity and city gas, and to
limit competition for each other’s commercial gas customers.
•  The JFTC believes that each company held discussions on these actions at multiple levels,
including at the executive level.
•  The electricity market was liberalized in 2016 and the gas market in 2017. This is the first antitrust

probe since then.
•  Regulators suspect that Toho Gas and Chubu Electric struct deals over the prices of electricity and
gas in certain markets.
•  They also suspect that Chubu Electric, Kansai Electric, and Chugoku Electric agreed not to acquire
corporate clients in each other’s original geographical areas, as defined before the market
liberalization.
•  JFTC believes the companies formed a cartel to protect themselves amid intensifying competition

due to entry of new gas / power retailers into the market.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kansai Electric, Chubu Electric cancels bond sales after antitrust inspectors visit
(Jiji press, April 16)
o  Kansai Electric said it will cancel a ¥60 billion bond sale due to an on-site inspection by

Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (JFTC). The utility apologized to potential investors and
said the cancellation is due to protect investors and prevent market disruption that could
follow the inspection.

o  Chubu Electric has also called off plans this month to issue ¥10 billion in 10-year bonds.
• TAKEAWAY: That the utilities were paid a visit by the JFTC does not immediately mean they had violated the
antitrust law. What’s more, it will take at least a year until the JFTC will reach a decision. Typically, the
commission takes two years to formally publish its charges.

• It’s unclear at this point whether the companies will be charged for restraining competition or price cartels. The
latter is more serious and does not allow for leniency programs.

• If charged of cartels, and if seen as extremely malicious, the antitrust authority would escalate the case to
prosecutors to file criminal charges.
• What’s more, once antitrust behaviors is established, company officials are likely to face litigation from

shareholders seeking damages.
• At the very least, the government will suspend the guilty parties from public tenders.

• Chances are, companies will deliberately offer more information to the investigators to be eligible for
discounts in fines, the base amounts of which were raised at the end of last year.

• However, Chugoku Electric’s press release did not say that it will cooperate with the authority, or that it regrets
the raid. Could it be that the company challenges the allegation?
• If regulators fail to collect enough evidence, the companies will still be given a warning, as happened in a
recent case against Mazda automaker. Warnings suggest that there were potential law violations. Shareholders

can still file litigations based on that, but are unlikely to win.
• However, several of the power companies clearly decided to minimize their penalties risk by immediately
stopping bond sales. That’s because fines tend to be set at 10% of the value of activities deemed to have

been antitrust and ongoing business will count towards the fineable amount.
• Should the utilities be found guilty of manipulations in the high-voltage power market for large corporate
customers, the size of the fines would be very considerable. That market is worth around ¥1 trillion / year,
which would mean that in total, fines could run into the tens of billions of yen (hundreds of millions of dollars).

• The probe may still widen. If such violations were occurring in the western areas, why not in the eastern
catchment area of TEPCO?




Japan officially announced plans to discharge treated Fukushima water into ocean
(Japan NRG, April 13)
•  Japan’s Cabinet made an official decision on April 13 to start releasing into the ocean treated
wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear site.
•  The water is extracted from the wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant and is treated to remove
most of the radioactive elements.
•  One element that is near impossible to extract, however, is tritium, which is a radioactive form of

hydrogen. The levels of tritium in the water are well below the international norms. This water will
still be diluted more than 100-fold using seawater before release.
•  The International Atomic Energy Agency has said it supports Japan’s actions and deems the
proposed radiation levels in the water to be entirely safe.
•  However, the release has drawn opposition from local fishermen and others, including neighboring
countries.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENTS:
Chinese Foreign Ministry protests release of radioactive water
(NHK, April 16)
o  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the Japanese Ambassador to

Beijing to convey China’s opposition to plans to dump radioactive water stored on the
site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster into the sea.
o  China is calling on Japan to allow Chinese scientists to perform tests at the site and reach
consensus with international agencies before discharging any radioactive water.
o  Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized Japan for not consulting its
neighbors before deciding to discharge the water.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

More tanks to be built despite discharge of waste
(Asahi Shimbun, April 15)
o  The planned discharge into the sea of radioactive water stored on the site of the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster is unlikely to reduce the number of storage tanks
required because the contaminated water continues to be transferred to storage tanks
faster that it can be processed.
o  The constant influx of rain and groundwater onto the site means that the volume of water

that needs to be treated is also rising constantly, to the tune of around 140 metric tons
per day.
o  As emptying existing tanks will take time, it looks like TEPCO will need to yet build more
tanks to cover the ever-rising volumes.
o  As it can take up to two years to construct additional tanks, government officials say
construction work needs to begin well in advance, based on future projections of waste

volume.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Why the decision to release treated Fukushima water took a decade
(Asia Nikkei, April 13)
o  Distrust of TEPCO and of the government after a series of missteps and basic errors
hindered plans for discharge




Japan’s biggest coal generator scraps plan for new plant, citing global pushback
(Nikkei, April 17)
•  J-Power said it has canceled plans to build a coal-fired power plant in Yamaguchi prefecture to
better align its emissions with growing global pushback against fossil fuels.
•  J-Power will now focus on curbing CO2 at existing thermal power assets and try to do so at the

lowest cost possible.
•  Originally projected as a two-unit 1,200 MW coal-fired power plant in Ube City, it was scaled down
to a one-unit station after one of the project partners, Osaka Gas, withdrew in 2019. Now, even the
one-unit facility does not make economic sense, J-Power said.
•  The global pushback against coal generation also contributed to the decision, according to J-
Power.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

• TAKEAWAY: J-Power is a state-backed power company and it’s unlikely that this decision was made due to
economics alone. Raising financing for a coal project today is difficult and probably one of the factors that
made J-Power scrap the plan. However, another weightier reason was probably government strategy. With PM
Suga meeting with President Biden last week and attending Earth Summit this week, it’s a good time for
Japan’s government to show support for the green movement. Having a state-backed firm announce plans to

ditch a coal-fired station is part of the government’s messaging.
• As importantly, this announcement makes it highly unlikely for any other Japanese coal-fired projects that have
yet to begin construction to do so.





Japan to double capacity of Interregional transmission lines to accommodate offshore wind
(Nikkei, April 15)
•  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry released plans to boost the capacity of the Japanese
grid to transmit electricity between regions by an additional 23 GW.
•  Undersea cables linking Hokkaido to Eastern Honshu will free up to an additional 12 GW. New
transmission lines will also join Kyushu to Shikoku and Chugoku, and Shikoku to the Kansai region.
•  Historically, Japanese authorities have tended not to invest in distributed transmission

infrastructure. In 2019/20, only 8.5% of the electricity transmitted in Japan travelled along
interregional transmission lines.
•  The new lines will make it easier to transport power generated by wind farms to population
centers.




Survival of the fittest in the wake of F Power collapse
(Shukan Economist, April 20)
•  After sustaining losses of ¥46 billion, long established electricity retailer F Power was forced to file
for protection under the Company Rehabilitation Act in March, shocking recent entrants into the
industry.
•  With an increase in divestments and mergers behind the scenes, F Power is unlikely to be the only
power retailer to go to the wall.

•  As of June 2020, Japan had over 1,400 electricity retailers, and dedicated retailers that lack their
own generation facilities commanded an 18% share of the market.
•  While excessive exposure to the Japan Electric Power Exchange was a factor in the January crisis,

Bankrupt electricity retailer, F Power, expected to stay in business, shocking Daiwa
(Sentaku, April issue)
o  F Power’s filing for bankruptcy on March 24 shocked Daiwa Group. The electricity retailer
should be able to ask for a 100% capital reduction. As a result, the equity of Daiwa, which
owns over 80% of F Power via various of its funds, will be wiped out.

o  F Power has debts of over ¥46 billion, including imbalance fee liabilities of up to ¥20
billion. But since F Power will not be able to settle during the fiscal year ending June
2021, it will not face insolvency.
o  F Power will not lose its JEPX membership, and as long as it can pay it can continue
business operations.

o  F Power already has several strong sponsors, which should allow it to cover all liabilities,
and the company imagines itself transforming into a new clean power company.
o  The company rehabilitation law, under which F Power has filed for bankruptcy, is a 1951
legislation that has never been applied to a power company. Feeling guilty for its part in
the January price spike, METI will not object to F Power seeking court protection under
this 1951 law.
o  That means, F Power will be able to emerge free of Daiwa. What’s more, F Power was

buying about 60% of its electricity from Daiwa’s thermal power assets, but now it will be
able to buy all of its electricity from renewables sources.
o  This leaves Daiwa with a major problem, since it has yet to pay off the cost of
construction for the coal-fired Kushiro power station, which only went online last year.
Daiwa will have to sell the electricity from Kushiro to JEPX.
o  Daiwa’s IDI Infrastructure funds, which own over 50% of F Power, are expected to post

over ¥23 billion in losses connected with this affair. While the funds are not consolidated
by Daiwa, the financial group won’t be left unscathed.
o  TEPCO too is upset, since it has long-term agreements to sell fuel to IDI Infrastructure’s
thermal power plants. If F Power is restructured, these contracts will likely be terminated.
o  Daiwa’s foray into the energy business did not consider the risks involved.

Power company bankruptcies: it’s time for reform

(Nikkei opinion, April 16)
o  A push by F-Power to increase its subscribers between 2017 and 2019 caused the
company’s margins to fall.
o  F-Power’s investors also became distrustful of the company’s executives, who in March
denied that they are personally liable to compensate the company for losses sustained
during the January power shortage.
o  Many new entrants into the retail market do not have any generation facilities of their

own and are therefore completely dependent on the wholesale market.
o  The author hopes that the collapse of F-Power will prompt the government to reform the
environment in which power companies operate, so that we see true deregulation aimed
at reducing the cost to the consumer.




Ex-PM Abe joins LDP lobby group for nuclear power
(Denki Shimbun, April 14)
•  A group of LDP diet members officially launched what it is calling the confederation for the
modernization of nuclear power. The group is calling for the modernization and replacement of
Japan’s existing nuclear power stations in the interests of carbon neutrality and energy security.
•  The group is led by prominent LDP politician Inada Tomomi. Former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo is

an official advisor to the group, and 44 Diet members attended the initial meeting.

•  In an address to the group, former Prime Minister Abe called for the greater utilization of nuclear
energy, which he described as an inexpensive source of electricity and a way for Japan to maintain
its geopolitical power while achieving carbon neutrality.




Nuclear waste facility proposed for Tsuruga
(Mainichi Shimbun, April 16)
•  A group based in Tsuruga City (Fukui Prefecture) proposed that an interim storage facility for
nuclear waste be constructed in the municipality.
•  Proponents of the plan say it would allow Fukui, which is currently home to several nuclear power
stations, to meet its obligations to store the nuclear waste generated by its reactors, as well as

providing an ongoing source of revenue after existing reactors have been decommissioned.
•  The proposal looks to encounter significant opposition, however, since the removal of waste from
Fukui is currently a prerequisite of KEPCO’s negotiations with the local authorities.



Kansai Electric restarts Takahama NPP Unit 4, connects it to the grid

(Japan NRG, April 10)
•  The utility said it would restart nuclear reactor Unit 4 at the Takahama NPP from April 12 and
connect it to the grid from April 15.
•  The original plans were for January but the facility had problems with heat pipes.
•  CONTEXT: This is the utility’s third reactor restart in the last few months.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kansai Electric older reactor restart plans again in turmoil

(Sentaku, April issue)
o  METI is frustrated as it seems Kansai Electric (KEPCO) may have again messed up plans
to restart older reactors, those already over 40 years in operation.
o  METI Minister Kajiyama personally persuaded Fukui prefecture governor Sugimoto in
February to let the utility restart operations at its Mihama NPP Unit 3 and Takahama NPP
Units 1 and 2. The minister promised that used nuclear fuel would be disposed outside of

Fukui prefecture.
o  Kajiyama thought he had reached an agreement with the newly completed Mutsu nuclear
waste storage facility in Aomori prefecture to take in KEPCO’s old fuel. However, the
local government assembly announced that the city of Mutsu did not agree with such
plans.
o  As a result, Fukui prefecture is delaying final approvals for the restart of KEPCO’s three
older units.

o  KEPCO initially wanted to start up Mihama NPP before the summer peak and run it until
Oct. 25. That period would act as evidence that the older reactors work well. Now these
plans are in disarray.
o  Where the utility has messed up is in not getting in place agreements with local
prefecture governments. That’s likely because the people who were in charge of those
government relations, and were good at them, were kicked out of the company after last
year’s scandals.

EDITORIAL: Nuclear plants should be nationalized to ensure stable electricity supply
(President, April 9)
•  CONTEXT: President is one of the four major business magazines in Japan.
•  Since Kawamura Takashi stood down as TEPCO chair, no one has put up a hand for the unenviable

role, especially in the wake of recent scandals. The current acting chair, Utsuda Shoei, is due to
stand down at the end of June.
•  Not only is TEPCO Holdings ¥16 trillion in debt, but the deregulation of the electricity market has
seen it lose customers to competition.
•  Kansai Electric too has problems as it has yet to find a disposal facility that will accept its stockpile
of nuclear waste.
•  With most nuclear reactors idle, Japan came close to blackouts in January when electricity

consumption surged due to a cold snap.
•  The Japanese government and the country’s major power companies have a lot to answer for,
having done nothing to improve reactor safety or energy security in the 10 years since the
Fukushima disaster.
•  As the government plans a major review of its energy policy this year, the case for nationalizing all
nuclear power stations is strong.

Japan to boost funding for rare earths exploration; give JOGMEC more powers
(Nikkei, April 12)
•  The government plans to increase funding for exploration of critical raw materials such as rare
earths. Competition for these resources is intensifying as the world shifts to electric vehicles and

renewable energy.
•  The ceiling on how much funding for a particular exploration project can come from the state will
be lifted. At present, it is capped at 50%.
•  This would allow state-backed Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. (JOGMEC) to shoulder
more than half of the costs of exploring and developing natural resource mines.
•  Exploration for new sources of raw materials is risky and expensive, and can take over a decade.
•  CONTEXT: The government is concerned that Japan’s access to future supplies of rare earths may

be restricted due to competition with other nations and China in particular.
•  JOGMEC’s expanded role will be limited to lithium, cobalt, cerium and a few other rare earths
critical to EV battery production. The company will still be precluded from owning or funding an
entire project.
• TAKEAWAY: Any impact from this rule change will take over a decade to materialize, but it is sensible to start
approaching material procurement on a more national, strategic level. The main firms charged with finding
new resources in Japan have been trading houses. However, these firms have diversified heavily away from

natural resources and have a much lower mining profile and risk tolerance than what Japan needs to secure
the resources for its future. It will be interesting to see which firms will partner with JOGMEC under the new
conditions.

Japanese shippers led by Mitsui OSK explore employing methanation for ship fuel

(Bloomberg, April 15)
•  Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) is head of a group of nine Japanese firms, which includes Nippon Steel, to
look at the possibility of producing and using methane to power “zero-emission ships.”
•  Methane is seen as an alternative to LNG or other fossil fuels. It could be employed for a new type
of ship that will transport CO2.
•  Methanation is “the most realistic solution” for MOL to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,

company CEO Hashimoto told Bloomberg in an interview. Methane, unlike hydrogen or ammonia,
can be transported with existing natural gas infrastructure, according to Hashimoto.
•  Methanation is a process of turning CO2 and hydrogen into methane. When the latter is burned to
generate power, the CO2 captured earlier in the process is released back into the atmosphere,
thus making it a net-zero carbon emissions cycle.



Mitsubishi Heavy signs accord to build CCS at NextDecade’s LNG plant in Texas

Shift to Electric Vehicles Faces Legal and Cost Issues
Amid Growing Wrangles Over IP

The global shift to electric vehicles (EV) is turning more complicated, and potentially
much more costly than initially imagined.

A growing power struggle over the intellectual property (IP) of the core components
that make up an EV, including its core battery tech and charging infrastructure,
threatens to derail plans of governments, including that of Japan, to have their
transport sector move away from the internal combustion engine (ICE) in the next
decade or so.

This patent war has pit traditional automakers like Toyota and Honda against
information and communication technology (ICT) firms, which own the IP to many of
the components and tech needed for EVs.

Tech firms are asking for a new royalty scheme that fairly compensates their
innovation. The auto industry says this would bump up the price of EVs and open
them up to more legal wrangling at a time when there is government pressure to
make EVs competitive with vehicles running on gasoline and diesel.

In Japan, this escalation is doubly complicated by the fact that it has heavyweights on
both sides. Panasonic, Sony, Sharp and Fujitsu are among the seven Japanese
members of the global consortium leading the charge against the automakers.


Who “owns” the car of the future?
After decades of development, traditional automakers have created – and patented –
nearly all the parts of an ICE vehicle. The increased use of connectivity and
computerization in today’s cars, however, leaves traditional automakers reliant on
sourcing more and more components from the high-tech industry. The underlying IP
for them lies with technology firms such as Nokia, NEC, Siemens, and others.

Toyota ranks fourth and Honda fifth in Japan’s ranking of approved patents, with a
strong presence in power trains and control systems. Yet, this is not enough.

The age of EVs is raising automakers’ reliance on the IP of the tech industry to a new
level. Sensing a business opportunity, last year the tech firms grouped together to
demand from Japanese automakers better compensation mechanism for their 5G
networks R&D.

A large part of the tech patents relate to connectivity, which is provided by micro
baseband chips, which alone involve more than 30,000 patents.

The majority of the IP for baseband chips is classified as standardized essential
patents (SEPs), which should be offered to automakers on fair, reasonable and non-
discriminatory (FRAND) terms. However, what exactly constitutes “fair” is now under

dispute.

Automakers want to pay the patent fees based on the cost of the component. A
baseband chip used in a car typically costs around $20 per unit.

Tech companies would like to apply the cost formula not to the component but to the
final product. That would apply the percentage-based royalty fee to, say, a $50,000
vehicle.

While the EV market was small, the dispute was a distraction. As Japan and other
governments rolled out pledges to ban sales of new ICE vehicles by 2035 or earlier,
this changed the nature of the dispute.

“At this point, SEP licensing is not having a visible impact on EV development, but
there are potential issues in the future,” said an executive at a major Japanese
automaker. “If licensing fees are demanded inappropriately, such as on the basis of
the prices of a final product such as a car,” it will create many complications.

Automakers argue that to make EVs a reality, all technology IP owners need to work
together to create industry standards and compatible platforms. Without this, a mass
rollout of EVs and related infrastructure will be costly and troublesome.

For example, a lot of IP that’s related to wireless charging and electricity smart meters
is also under SEP terms. This technology has yet to be introduced and commercialized
in Japan.

Another 30,000 patents relate to positioning and route navigation systems. Many are
important for the development of automated driving.

With such a wide array of core EV technologies under patent protection, it makes
sense to combine all the royalty fees and calculate payments based on the final
product price, according to the technology firms.

Such technology development has required vast resources and innovation should be
rewarded, said a Japanese holder of some of the patents. ICT firms need to remain
incentivized to innovate further, the holder added.


Decisions affecting Japan taken in European courts
Patent disputes are often resolved via courts, and plenty of lawsuits around the issue
have already flared up in Germany, the U.S., the UK, China, and Japan.

Some of the suits resulted in negotiated settlements, such as Sharp’s filing against
Tesla in Tokyo last year. However, the cases that end up with a ruling can have a far
greater consequence than for the firms involved in them.

A 2019 court decision in the UK stated that its judgment would apply globally, leaving
Japanese policymakers scrambling.

Japan’s government and courts have been understandably wary of rushing in to rule
on one side or the other. As well as being home to some of the world’s biggest auto

the center of the dispute are held by Japanese companies.

Once the European rulings started to come through, the Japanese government
decided to take a more active role in the matter. METI set up an expert panel on SEP
in March 2020, and the Cabinet Office created a separate committee to step up its
review IP issues.

Historically, Japanese government would aim to resolve the situation through the
creation of a dispute settlement framework. However, many in the industry are
skeptical of how much influence the government can have in this case. Most of the
licensing rule enforcement so far has come from the courts.

This is where Japan is again at a disadvantage. German courts take decisions within
six months. Japan’s judiciary processes is much lengthier. What’s more, the monetary
value of compensation in Japanese rulings tends to be small compared with Europe
and the U.S. This makes it less attractive for patent owners to start legal proceedings
in Japan and thus moving the decision-making center elsewhere.

The Japan Patent Office has promised to reform the patent dispute system. Until that
happens, Japanese automakers have another incentive to speed up their innovation in
EVs – to secure their rights to the technology that should define the new era of
mobility.

Bioenergy: a route to decarbonization for Japan

As Japan reconsiders its energy mix in light of the country’s pledge to decarbonize by
2050, one option that makes sense to consider more deeply is bioenergy. This energy
source could in the near term drastically lower Japan’s CO2 emissions from road
transport, aviation, power generation and even stimulate quick growth of clean
hydrogen.

To date, bioenergy utilization in Japan has been modest. The current version of the
nation’s energy mix sees biomass accounting for 3.7% to 4.6% of the total by 2030.

The potential of this renewable energy source is much higher, and Brazil can serve
both as an example of how this works in practice and a partner in developing Japan’s
bioenergy industry.

Thanks also to our strong reliance on bioenergy, Brazil was recently able to submit a
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitment of a 43% reduction in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, from 2005 levels. That’s the highest NDC
target of all non-European members of the G20.

A greater embracing of bioenergy could give a boost to Japan’s decarbonization
plans. Recognizing that countries will find their own routes to decarbonization, Brazil
stands ready to work with Japan on the environmental, business, and economic
possibilities that the bioenergy path could create.

Brazil’s energy model
Despite being one of the world’s biggest nations in terms of land size and population,
Brazil has been able to elevate renewables to 83% of our electricity mix. Renewables
also represent 41% of the total primary mix.

Both figures are three times higher than the world average, and as a result Brazil’s
exports are cleaner too. This is something that will surely play a role as nations
consider ways to put a value on the carbon component of goods.

















One of the “secrets” behind Brazil’s position as the world’s No. 3 producer of
renewables electricity is its strength in bioenergy. In fact, bioenergy accounted for a
third of Brazil’s total energy supply in 2019.

Modern bioenergy is now responsible for half of all global renewables generation.
Yet, according to both IEA and IRENA, bioenergy in the final energy consumption
needs to double by 2030, and the use of biofuels in transport needs to triple in the
same timeframe, to keep global warming in check.

The world needs quick, ready solutions, and Brazil can play an important role in
providing solutions to climate change. As the world and Japan move to decarbonize
their economies, Brazil and Japan have a lot of potential synergies in the energy and
related fields that would create increased trade, investment, and joint research.

In fact, I should say that these synergies are already being explored.


Brazil-Japan energy solution: Gasoline
Brazilian biofuel made of sugarcane is currently being exported to Japan in the form
of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). ETBE is then blended with gasoline at a ratio of 3%.

Brazil’s sugarcane ethanol reduces CO2 emissions by 90% on average compared to
gasoline and does not disseminate suspended particulate matter, considered an
aggravating factor for respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

Still, the 3% blend is low, which means there is ample room to cut emissions more
severely by using more ethanol in Japan’s transport sector. The ratio could be easily
raised to 10% with no change to the conventional engines. In Brazil, the rate of
ethanol in gasoline is now at 27%.

Of course, we are aware of the global push towards electric vehicles and fuel cell
transport, which will play a very important role in the future of transportation.
However, that moment when the majority of cars on the roads are non-gasoline is
many years away. Switching to a higher ethanol blend is a low-hanging fruit that helps
us reduce emissions now. What’s more, biofuels can be transported using tankers and
other existing infrastructure.

Given these characteristics, I am convinced that increasing the use of Brazilian
sugarcane ethanol could be the single most powerful policy to quickly reduce
emissions in Japan’s transport sector.

For the oil industry, the increased use of ethanol in the gasoline holds the promise of
a soft energy transition. There are opportunities for Japanese companies to invest in
this sector both in Brazil and Japan, in terms of expanding the infrastructure and in
industrial processes.

The development of sugarcane biofuel for use as aviation fuel is also advancing fast.
Airplanes are known as hard to electrify and Japanese airlines have spent a lot of
resources trying to source sustainable fuel. Among their challenges has been scale.
That is where Brazil’s vast bioenergy complex can come in as a solution.


Brazil-Japan energy solution: Electricity
The use of solid biomass to produce electricity is another promising area for Brazilian
and Japanese companies. The sector is set to grow strongly.

In a recent report, IRENA predicts that biomass’ role in the electricity mix will have to
increase from 4% to 16% by 2050. IRENA ranks Brazil as the top electricity generator
from solid biofuels.

According to a recent study from the Brazilian Association of Pellets and Briquettes
Biomass Industries, the production of biomass pellets has been growing at the rate of
35% per year for seven years. The study also provides an estimate of the biomass
production potential in Brazil – around 577 million tons per year.

Some Japanese companies are already exploring this space. Trading house Sumitomo
Corporation formed a JV with Cosan/Raízen of Brazil to develop sugarcane bagasse
pellets. This material is ideal for repurposing coal power plants. It is versatile, being
able to substitute coal, natural gas and fuel oil for the generation of electricity and
heat.

Another major advantage of sugarcane pellets: their GHG emissions are reabsorbed
within a year, whereas emissions from wood pellets take at least 10 years, according
to data from the companies involved in the project.

Coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS), biomass will become a key
technology to deliver negative emissions. Japan has named CCS as an essential part

of its path to net-zero emissions and Brazil is ready to work with Japan in researching,
realizing and investing in this technology.

Japanese and Brazilian companies could have a first-mover advantage in this
segment, shaping the move to repurpose coal and natural gas power plants across
the world.


Brazil-Japan energy solution: hydrogen
Bioenergy may also be key to unlocking the potential of hydrogen as an economically
viable source of energy.

Hydrogen is enjoying unprecedented momentum of late, with many countries
pursuing its development and adaptation. However, according to IRENA, 95% of all
hydrogen is generated from natural gas and coal. There is no significant hydrogen
production from renewable source. For this reason, IRENA highlights that production
of hydrogen is responsible for around 830 million tons of CO2 emissions per year,
equivalent to the output of the UK and Indonesia combined.

However, hydrogen can also be made from clean primary sources and there are
meaningful developments in this field. For example, Nissan, in partnership with the
University of Campinas and the University of São Paulo in Brazil, is developing an
electric fuel cell car based on hydrogen made with ethanol.

Besides being much cleaner than hydrogen derived from coal, ethanol-backed
hydrogen benefits from ethanol’s existing infrastructure. This an avenue that Brazilian
and Japanese firms could explore further.

Bioenergy: a route to decarbonization
Climate change requires decisive
action. The climate challenge is
mostly an energy challenge, since the
energy that powers our daily lives
accounts for three quarters of global
emissions. As all countries search for
ways to reduce emissions, bioenergy
is a viable and proven option. The
opportunities in bioenergy sector are
many. Together, Brazil and Japan are
well positioned to seize them.

GLOBAL       VIEW

BY TOM O’SULLIVAN

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices.

Oil Prices:
WTI and Brent prices rose $4 a barrel following IEA and OPEC projections that global
oil demand should increase 6 mb/d YoY in 2021 due to vaccine campaigns and a
strengthening global economy. WTI closed the week at $63 and Brent at $67. IEA is
now projecting total global oil consumption will average 97 mb/d in 2021. Japan’s
crude oil imports averaged 2.5 mb/d in FY2020.

Aviation:
France is planning to ban all short-haul internal flights of less than 2.5 hours where
electric train alternatives exist in an attempt to reduce CO2 emissions. These plans are
expected to impact travel between Paris and the cities of Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux.

EVs:
XPeng, the Chinese EV manufacturer, unveiled its third production vehicle, the P5,
that has a 600km driving range. The P5 will compete against Tesla models
manufactured in China.

Nuclear:
Agreement was reached between the State of New York, Entergy, and Holtec to
provide for the transfer of Indian Point NPP to Holtec for decommissioning and site
remediation after the station’s Unit 3 finally shuts down on Apr. 30. Unit 3 was first
commissioned in 1976. Unit 1 closed in 1974 and Unit 2 in 2020.

Cryptocurrencies:
With the IPO of Coinbase last week, a new forecast for energy consumed in mining
cryptocurrencies put it at the equivalent of the energy consumption of Saudi Arabia or
Italy, with emissions estimated to be equivalent to that of Nigeria by 2024.

China:
John Kerry was expected to press China on its 2030 peak carbon and 2060 carbon-
neutral goals when he met Chinese Vice-Premier Han Zheng in Shanghai last week.
Kerry was also expected to push China to green the Belt and Road Initiative.
Meanwhile China has accused the U.S. of being like a “truant getting back to class”
after its exit from the Paris Agreement in 2017 and is pushing the U.S. to take more
responsibility. Japan’s Environment Ministry is also publicly pushing China to be more
proactive on climate change. Meanwhile Xi Jinping has not yet committed to
attending the Earth Day Summit convened by the U.S. on April 22.

South Korea:
SK and LG, two South Korean conglomerates, resolved a multi-billion EV battery
dispute over intellectual property that will allow SK to resume battery supply to Ford
and Volkswagen EV factories in the U.S. SK has invested $2.6 billion in a battery
production facility in the State of Georgia.

Taiwan:
Taiwan is facing its worst water shortages in more than half a century, which is
impacting chip production. The government recently issued its first water red alert in
five years with water levels at some reservoirs dropping below 15% of capacity. Water
rationing has started. Taiwan periodically suffers power blackouts.

Myanmar:
POSCO, the South Korean steelmaker, will terminate its JV with the military-controlled
MEHL.

Australia:
Attempts to introduce EVs to the Australian market are floundering according to
Electric Vehicle Council in Australia with take-up rates among the worst in the G20
due to a lack of incentives.

New Zealand (NZ):
The government has introduced a new law that will require all banks, insurers, and
asset managers with assets of more than $700 million to report the impact of climate
change on their business. Around 200 NZ companies would be affected by the
legislation.

UAE:
Taqa, the state backed utility, plans to boost RE energy output six-fold to 30% of its
energy mix by 2030, and to increase overall power capacity from 18 GW to 30 GW by
2030. Solar power will be the major RE power source at two facilities, Noor Abu Dhabi
and Al Dhafra. Marubeni and Jinko Solar are co-investors in the 1.2 GW Noor Abu
Dhabi solar facility.

Iran:
Iran will seek to increase uranium enrichment to 60% following the explosion at the
Natanz uranium enrichment facility on Apr.11 thereby endangering the success of the
JCPOA talks in Vienna. This could defer Iran’s attempts to fully restore oil production
and exports. However, Iranian oil production was 2.3 mb/d in March, the highest since
May 2019 on the back of increased exports to China. Iranian authorities have
described the explosions at Natanz as “nuclear terrorism” and plan to add 1,000 more
centrifuges.

Israel:
Another Israeli commercial vessel, the Hyperion, was attacked off the coast of the
UAE, near Fujairah Port, on Tuesday in what appears to be a continuation of the tit-
for-tat strikes between Israel and Iran.

Russia:
The U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russia but notably exempted Nord Stream 2 from
this round. Ukraine is expected to apply pressure on the U.S. to sanction the project.

Uganda:
Uganda and Tanzania signed the East African Oil Pipeline Project that will transport oil
from Albertine in Uganda to Tanga in Tanzania. China’s CNOOC and France’s Total
operate the oil fields in Uganda. The pipeline will be over 1,400 km long.

South Africa:
Karpowership, a unit of Turkey’s Karadeniz Energy Group, has been named as the
preferred supplier of electricity from three floating vessels to South Africa in a deal
worth $15 billion. Karpowership provides floating electricity generation fueled by LNG
and will provide 1.2 GW of power to South Africa. The project is aimed at closing a
supply gap in South Africa that results in periodic blackouts. The 20-year deal will cost
as much as $760 million annually.

Spain:
Acciona Energy, the Spanish energy conglomerate, will IPO its RE business which aims
to increase installed capacity to 25 GW by 2025. The company is expected to achieve
a valuation of $14 billion.

U.K.:
1). The UK achieved its lowest ever CO2 emissions per kWh (39g) on Apr. 7 when
clean energy sources exceeded 80% of the electricity mix.
2). Royal Dutch Shell outlined its first energy transition strategy that will include more
focus on electricity and biofuels. This will be put to a shareholder vote next month, the
first time an oil major has adopted this strategy of seeking shareholder approval.
3). Global Energy Monitor, a UK non-profit, will develop a global registry of fossil fuels
to track the embedded CO2 in fossil fuel reserves.
4). Private equity groups’ ownership of UK North Sea oil and gas assets is thought to
exceed 30% as oil and gas majors such as Exxon sell out.

U.S.:
JP Morgan has committed $2.5 trillion to climate-focused investments over the next
decade. This follows similar commitment by other Wall Street banks including Bank of
America.
