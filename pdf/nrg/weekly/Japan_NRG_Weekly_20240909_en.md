NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Toyota, Nissan, etc to boost domestic battery production capacity with ¥1 trillion investment

(Nikkei, Sept 6)
•  Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor and other manufacturers will invest ¥1 trillion to expand production
for storage batteries in Japan by 50% with the help of state support.
•  The investments will go mainly toward automotive batteries for EVs and would lift total capacity to
120 GWh from the current 80 GWh.
•  METI is set to announce ¥350 billion in aid, seeking to reach 150 GWh by 2030. METI will offer aid
for production of battery components and related equipment.

•  Toyota’s investment is expected to be around ¥250 billion. The firm plans to include a new factory
for EV batteries, slated to begin operation by the end of 2028. It is also working to develop solid-
state battery tech.
•  Nissan plans to invest around ¥150 billion in producing automotive lithium-iron phosphate
batteries and start supplying them in 2028.
•  Panasonic will make core lithium-ion battery components for Mazda and Subaru in Japan. The
investment is expected to total ¥550 billion.

•  CONTEXT: The initiative seeks to ensure a stable domestic supply of components that’s not
scattered across other Asian countries. The initiatives are part of a broader effort to help small and
midsize firms seeking to enter the electrification field. A group comprising about 20 firms including
Nissan, Toyota and Itochu seeks to create the nation's first resource recycling system for used EV
batteries. The goal is to extract rare metals from batteries that had previously been discarded and
to reuse them.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI requests ¥178 billion to strengthen battery production and supply chain
(Denki Shimbun, Sept 2)
o  In its budget request for FY2025, METI seeks more support for capital investment into
the storage battery sector, including all-solid-state batteries.
o  The total budget request is ¥2.36 trillion, a 23% increase over the initial FY2024 budget.

The FY2025 budget includes:
o  ¥177.8 billion to support strengthening the battery production supply chain, including
support for capital investment in all-solid-state batteries.
o  ¥77.7 billion to help build the GX supply chain, including support for capital investment
in PSC cells to be installed on building walls and windows.
o  A total of ¥982 billion is allocated for GX-related measures, up 53% over FY2024; and
¥782 billion is allocated for a special account for energy measures.
o  CONTEXT: Compared to lithium-ion batteries, all-solid-state batteries can double

cruising distance, and have a longer range with shorter recharge times than li-ion
batteries. Toyota Motor and Idemitsu Kosan aim to commercialize the batteries around
2027-2028.

• TAKEAWAY: News of Japanese automakers planning a major expansion of domestic battery capacity was
followed just a few days later by media reports that Toyota has actually decided to reduce its global EV
production target for 2026 by 30%. The reason is little to do with climate change, the energy transition or
Toyota. It’s simply that there has been a notable slowdown in EV sales, apart from in China, where the
government’s lavish subsidies and other support to domestic players have ensured that oversea automakers

will struggle to compete. Japanese automakers have to be ready for this EV sales trend to reverse and putting
more resources into battery R&D and new production capacity makes sense. However, given the uncertainty
over future EV interest, the government clearly feels it has to step in to de-risk the investments of the auto
companies.




Aomori expert panel proposes zones where renewables development won’t be allowed

(Government statement, Sept 4)
•  The Cohabitation Study Committee, a panel studying new ordinances for onshore wind and other
renewable energy installations in Aomori Pref, proposed identifying preservation and protection
zones where such projects won’t be allowed.
•  Some areas will be determined as “co-habitation zones” where renewable energy projects are
possible only if there is local community support.
•  The panel also outlined procedures to seek community consensus.

•  In the image below, the red areas are protected zones where renewable energy projects will be
banned outright, and yellow areas are preservation zones where such projects could be possible if
they win community consent.
•  CONTEXT: In the past few years there’s been a public backlash against new solar and wind farms
in some communities. Last year, spurred by increasing local discontent over the rapid local growth
in renewables, the new Aomori governor vowed to slow the rate of new installations by levying a

new tax on operators.
Now, local authorities will
assume greater control
over solar and onshore
wind projects. A panel
has recommended that
the prefecture uses

zoning rules, and placed
an emphasis on installing
an official community
consultation procedure.
• TAKEAWAY: Among the major
nations that have pledged specific
goals for the energy transition, Japan probably has the strongest sense of local identity and activist

communities that are willing to stand up to the plans of the central government and major corporations. The
country is currently at a stage of rebalancing between the needs and wishes of local communities and national
climate ambitions. But once the new equilibrium is reached, we expect industry growth to resume.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Environment Minister urges scaling down Kazuno wind project
(Government statement, Sept 6)
o  The Minister of Environment said the 106 MW East Kazuno Citizen's wind farm may need
to scale down if its impact on birdlife, plants, etc can’t be mitigated. There are bird

protection zones around the site.
o  Kazuno Green Energy plans to build 20-25 wind turbines, (capacity ranging from 4.2 to
6.1 MW), in a 2,700 hectare mountain area in the eastern part of Kazuno city.
o  Launch is slated for 2032.




Japan may subsidize shift to new tech for data centers to lower energy needs
(Nikkei Asia, Sept 2)
•  Japan plans to support the development of high-speed, light-based communication tech that
could lead to the construction of more data centers outside major cities.

•  The government is considering subsidies to promote this tech, aiming to begin next year, with
discussions between key ministries scheduled for this month.
•  Light-based networks offer faster data processing and lower energy consumption; they could help
handle large data flows from technologies like generative AI and autonomous vehicles, with
potential benefits for dispersing data centers nationwide.




NIMS seeks partnerships with businesses to research solid ammonia
(Japan NRG, Sept 6)
•  The state-run National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS) seeks partnerships with businesses to

research converting ammonia gas into a solid at room temperature.
•  In May 2023, Dr. Morishita Masao, while a Hyogo University professor, discovered that ammonia
could convert into solid form at room temperatures by trapping the substance into borate glass,
which resembles a fried donut filled with ice cream.
•  Dr. Morishita, who joined NIMS earlier this year, heads the NIMS project team on “Building
thermodynamic mathematical models on the structure and formation of solid ammonia, the dream

hydrogen carrier”.
•  CONTEXT: Ammonia converts into liquid at -30C and could be transported, but there are safety
issues such as slips and corrosion of containers and equipment in contact with it. Dr. Morishita was
initially studying hydrogen storage in ammonia borane compounds, and said that his discovery of
solid ammonia was purely accidental.
• TAKEAWAY: Dr. Morishita found that ammonia stays intact in borate glass until 52C. If this ammonia borane
mechanism could be fully explained, it could resolve ammonia transport and storage issues, and widen the

hydrogen family’s energy potential. NIMS projects are mostly conducted in-house, but some projects are in
partnerships with universities and businesses.

Yamanashi Pref to power four buildings at NOVARE. The Hydro Q-BiC system, which is co-
developed with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), stores

hydrogen at room temperature and low pressure, making it suitable for general facilities.
•  Shimizu plans to store 910 GJ of hydrogen annually at NOVARE, integrating onsite and offsite
hydrogen supply, and aims to use NOVARE as a testing ground for advanced carbon-neutral
technologies.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Yamanashi Pref to launch hydrogen transport cost reduction trial

(YBS News, Sept 3)
o  Yamanashi Pref is advancing its green hydrogen supply hub to reduce hydrogen
transport costs by half, and will launch an experiment later this year.
o  A new facility is under construction in Kofu City’s Yonekurayama area, where research will
focus on compressing hydrogen to more than double its current pressure, from 200 to
450 atmospheres, to increase the amount of hydrogen transported.
o  The experiment is a collaboration of private companies utilizing state subsidies; the goal

is to enhance hydrogen supply chain profitability by addressing transport costs.

Battery manufacturer NGK Insulators to provide NaS batteries for demo in Hungary
(Company statement, Aug 30)
•  Battery manufacturing firm NGK Insulators won an order for sodium-sulfur (NaS) power storage
batteries to be installed at the Duna Center Therm Uzemi Szolgaltato, a subsidiary of Hungary’s

state-owned energy company MVM Balance.
•  MVM intends to utilize the full-scale storage batteries for adjusting the supply-demand balance of
renewables. This project will enable the Hungarian firm to verify the feasibility of grid-scale storage
batteries.
•  NGK Insulators is the only company in the world that produces molten NaS batteries on a
commercial scale.
•  CONTEXT: Hungarian law calls for carbon neutrality by 2050. Due to its flat topography, Hungary

is unable to rely on pumped-storage batteries, which require height differences in the terrain.
Hence, Hungary will have to rely on large grid-scale storage batteries to balance supply and
demand from renewable energy sources. The NaS battery is a molten-salt battery that uses liquid
sodium and liquid sulfur electrodes. This type of battery has a similar energy density as lithium-ion
batteries, and is produced with inexpensive and non-toxic materials.

Non-fossil value trading sees huge increase in renewable energy-designated contracts

(Denki Shimbun, Sept 2)
•  The first session of the 2024 non-fossil value trading market saw a sharp contrast: the volume of
trading in non-FIT certificates for "non-designated renewable energy" plummeted by 97.7% to
262 GWh, while that of "renewable energy-designated" certificates rose by 2.8 times (280%) to 1.7
TWh.
•  Bid volumes for both certificates were settled at the minimum price of ¥0.6/ kWh.
•  CONTEXT: This specific market was established to enable trading of certificates representing the

CO2 avoided by generating electricity from clean energy rather than the burning of fossil fuels. In
other words, it represents the trading of the environmental ‘value’ of electricity generated from
clean power sources.
•  Renewable energy-designated certificates have gained in popularity due to full tracking of non-
fossil certificates that includes detailed source information, aligning with international initiatives like
RE100. Non-designated renewable energy certificates, which are mainly derived from the
generation of power from nuclear plants, saw an oversupply but limited demand.

Tohoku Electric begins fuel loading at Onagawa NPP Unit 2
(Company statement, Sept 3)
•  Tohoku Electric began fuel loading for Onagawa NPP Unit 2. The process will take about one
week.
•  CONTEXT: Fuel loading involves inserting fuel assemblies into the reactor. The NPP is expected to

restart in November, and commercial operations are slated for December. The plant's reactor is a
BWR, the same type as Fukushima Daiichi NPP. If it restarts, it will be the first BWR to do so since
the March 2011 disaster.
• TAKEAWAY: Despite Tohoku Electric's optimism, the restart of Onagawa NPP isn’t a certainty. The plant has
faced many delays, and it’s now nine months behind schedule due to safety issues. At this stage, it’s difficult to
identify defects, which might only emerge during full operation, thereby increasing the chance of further

stoppage.

OTL, Riamwind to sell compact windmills that withstand typhoons
(Nikkei, Sept 5)
•  Okinawa Total Logistics, a transportation firm, will sell small power-generating windmills that can
generate up to 1 kWh of electricity (enough to power a fridge for a few hours).
•  The company is working with a Kyushu University startup, Riamwind, to develop the tech, which

can generate electricity even in strong winds when turbines would normally be stopped to prevent
damage.
•  The tech uses rotating blades that are surrounded by a circular cover about 2 meters in diameter,
and the wind hitting the cover creates a vortex that draws it into the turbine by creating a
difference in atmospheric pressure.
•  CONTEXT: The move comes amid growing demand from local govts for evacuation centers,

especially as typhoon routes are more diverse and often pass through the southernmost part of
Japan. The company is also considering a service that combines a stockpile warehouse and wind
power generation for when a disaster strikes.

Booming Battery Storage Pipeline Gives New Impetus to Energy Transition

Japan's expanding data center industry and the growth of digital infrastructure are
driving up energy demand, spurring the adoption of innovative green solutions such
as battery storage systems that are crucial for the long-term success of renewable
power generation.

For many renewables developers and major power users, integrating Battery Energy
Storage Systems (BESS) into the grid is becoming essential to accelerate clean energy
projects and make them viable. However, securing a grid connection has led to
bottlenecks, with the green project pipeline increasingly congested due to limited
transmission capacity.

Both central and local governments are addressing this issue through subsidies and
other initiatives to encourage the adoption of battery storage. One such initiative, the
Long-Term Decarbonized Power Sources Auction (LTDA) launched last year, has been
particularly successful in fueling the BESS boom. The results of the first round
convinced METI to double the capacity allocated for battery storage.

As Japan takes a leading role in Asia’s grid-scale energy storage market, it’s attracting
international companies, including players like Tesla, which is known for its large-scale
battery storage product, the Megapack.

Japan NRG examines the latest trends in Japan's grid-scale battery market.


Intensifying activity in power markets
In March 2023, the government announced a grid expansion master plan that requires
investment of up to ¥7 trillion through 2050. If successful then peak power demand
would largely be covered by solar and wind generation by mid century. Such a goal is
opening up many business opportunities for BESS, which could become the key to
accommodating more intermittent renewables sources in the power system.

The number of grid-scale storage batteries under consideration for connection has
tripled in the past year and will continue to grow. Earlier this summer ANRE said that
just under 40 GW of installed renewables capacity is already considering connection
to storage battery systems. By 2030, Japan's storage battery capacity is forecasted to
reach between 14.1 and 23.8 GWh.

In the medium term, energy storage is expected to gain momentum in various power
trading markets, with the majority of BESS investors currently assessing the scope and
accessibility of the spot, intraday, balancing, and capacity marketplaces, among other
options. The base business case here is that BESS growth required to balance the
increasing renewables load and to lessen green curtailments will necessarily filter into
power trading platforms because a pure battery storage business model is said to be
less suitable to tariff pricing and PPAs.

Rising energy prices and a tight supply-demand balance for electricity, coupled with
state subsidies for energy storage facilities, are expected to further drive demand for
BESS as a power source for both private consumption and supply-demand
adjustment.

Japan's battery storage systems will likely make up only 4% of the global market in
2024, but domestic market growth expectations are high and investment capital is
gathering quickly. New investors are also exploring BESS operational models that
deploy Demand Response (DR) and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) services, as well as
combination projects in which storage batteries are part of a system that supports on-
site PPA arrangement.

BESS as business model for non-energy sector
One of Japan's big three telecom operators, KDDI, is among the non-energy
companies to announce plans to build grid-connected storage facilities. KDDI
subsidiary au Renewable Energy, a partnership with TEPCO and ENERES, plans to
launch a battery business in the second half of FY2025. au Renewable Energy will
manage the system.

At the KDDI Oyama Network Center in Tochigi Prefecture, the business partners will
install a 324-square-meter BESS with an output of 1.99 MW and a capacity of 5.6
MWh. Construction is set to begin in December 2024. The system will use GS Yuasa's
ternary (NCM) lithium-ion batteries and Meidensha-made inverters.

According to the business group, the project will generate revenue through
participation in balancing and capacity markets, among other sales channels. The
project has also received a ¥343 million subsidy from the Tokyo Metropolitan
Government. ENERES will manage power trading and battery control, while TEPCO
Holdings will leverage its grid operations and battery expertise to handle design and
maintenance.

















Another communications firm, NTT Anode Energy, began building an “energy
distribution platform” to promote its green aggregation business. The goal is to
develop three businesses as an aggregator: renewable energy aggregation,
regulating power aggregation, and demand aggregation.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

The role of aggregators will increase since they’ll be able to control batteries and
distributed energy resources (DER), introducing optimization on both the electricity
supply and demand side. NTT Anode Energy seeks to bulk up the sale of its offering
in power regulation with its own storage batteries and through providing integrated
and centralized control services to other BESS operators.

As part of this effort, together with Kyushu Electric and Mitsubishi Corp, NTT Anode
Energy has begun operating a 1.4 MW/ 4.3 MWh storage battery in Kawara Town,
Fukuoka Prefecture.

Since FY2023, the company is also introducing medium-scale batteries, having been
selected for the Tokyo government and METI’s 2023 projects to promote grid-
connected energy storage solutions. By the end of FY2024, the firm plans 18 more
storage facilities nationwide.

Business opportunities for international firms
A recent survey by Tokyo-based research firm Fuji Keizai forecasts that the global
energy storage market will grow 3.4 times in value to ¥11.5 trillion by 2040, when it
will have a capacity of around 700 GWh. The domestic energy storage market may
see similar growth.

Japan was the first Asian destination for Elon Musk’s Tesla electric cars and now the
firm is now making local inroads with its Megapack storage system.


With an output of 10.8 MW and a storage capacity of 43 MWh, Tesla's Megapack has
been installed and is operational on the premises of Sendai Power Station. In June,
Tesla said the system would be connected to the grid and participate in the balancing
market.

The Megapack installation is part of Tesla’s integrated solution, which includes
lithium-ion batteries, a power conversion system, thermal management, and controls.

Notably, the Megapack will participate in the primary adjustment power category,
which has the fastest response time. This marks the first time in Japan that the
Megapack will be used for primary regulating power.

All the above developments reveal that Japan’s BESS sector, almost non-existent two
years ago, is on the verge of a breakout phase. However, it needs more investment
and state support to ensure the fast start and enthusiasm translates into a
considerable role in the nationwide energy system. Scale at a regional level will be
required for batteries to be recognized by the state energy planners as more than a
local or microgrid balancing solution.

Meanwhile, the sector must grapple with finding solutions to lower costs per kilowatt,
part of which will come through the standardization of projects and technologies. With
almost no BESS projects in existence, as yet, that can demonstrate how their batteries
perform over the course of decades, investors will be looking at projects with good
management track records and understanding of power trading to give them the
confidence to splash the cash.

Japan Looks to Farmland for Solar Expansion Amid Industry Slowdown

In an effort to boost solar power capacity, Japan is looking to install more solar panels
on farmland. While efforts go back more than a decade, widespread development has
been slow to catch on. However, Japan’s solar power goals for 2030 have given new
impetus to this niche. If it succeeds, it could significantly boost total solar power
capacity in the country, and serve as an example to others.

Often referred to as “agrisolar,” this approach refers to the dual use of land to
cultivate crops and generate electricity from solar panels installed above farmland. In
Japan, it’s also called “solar sharing,” while in Europe and North America it’s known
as agri-voltaics. Whatever the name, this approach to solar allows operators to
generate extra income from producing clean electricity.

The dual-use / dual-income strategy is gaining more traction in Japan recently with
international solar developers and big domestic firms getting involved. For some, this
is a chance to test new technologies. For many, this is an avenue for new capacity
growth, with large-scale utility solar projects today facing challenges such as a
shortage of open space and increasing scrutiny from residents who see solar farms as
an eyesore or worry about panels located on steep slopes.

Japan NRG takes a closer look at the challenges and opportunities facing the agrisolar
industry.


Over 4,000 projects to date
Agrisolar in Japan is already two decades old, and development has been measured
in small and slow steps. Akira Nagashima of CHO Technology Institute in Japan is
credited with leading early development of solar sharing. He filed for a patent in 2004
but opened the technology to the public in 2005 so anyone in any country could tap
into the technology for free.

In Japan, developing an agrisolar project requires permission for temporary land
conversion to set up poles to support photovoltaic panels while continuing to grow
crops. Poles need to be installed in a simple, easy-to-dismantle way.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) sent a notice in March 2013
to governors and local agricultural officials to clarify that installing solar panels over
farmland requires permission. Agrisolar got a boost in May 2018 when the MAFF
eased rules regarding the temporary conversion of farmland by extending the
duration of projects to ten years from three, if certain criteria are met.

As of March 2022, the MAFF has given permissions to 4,349 projects on 1,007
hectares of farmland across Japan. The density of solar panel capacity is 480 kW per
hectare for agrisolar and 1,330 kW per hectare for average ground-mounted projects.
(The figures are calculated by Japan NRG based on estimates provided by the Japan
Photovoltaic Energy Association).

The number of new permissions has risen ever since 2013 (except for in 2017). Crops
grown under solar panels include vegetables, fruits, ornamental plants, rice, and
wheat.

Among the 4,165 agrisolar projects that responded to a MAFF survey, 65% were built
by power generation firms, with the rest installed by farmers or land owners,
according to a document released in October 2023. Recently, even large international
players, such as China’s Trina Solar, have entered this sector. Trinasolar’s latest
agrivoltaic project in Kyoto Pref. combines solar PVs with yam cultivation, which
requires low light saturation.

In the same survey, MAFF asked operators who had received permissions before
FY2021 whether they faced any issues growing crops under solar panels. About 21%
of the 3,314 projects reported they did – a strong majority reporting a drop in yield
due to poor maintenance of farmland by farmers. Others cited natural disasters and
delays in construction.

Under MAFF rules, officials give guidance to agrisolar operators failing to meet the
requirement. There have been cases in which the operator is not allowed to reapply
for permission after refusing to follow the guidance, according to a white paper on
agriculture published in May.

The 1,007 hectares used for 4,349 projects is only a small fraction of total farmland in
Japan - about 4.3 million hectares. As it becomes more difficult to find wide-open
space for utility scale solar farms and more local governments adopt ordinances to
curb large solar installations, farmland is increasingly becoming a more promising
option.

The JPEA said in a solar outlook report in July that Japan has a total of 2,380 GW (dc)
of solar potential, of which 1,593 GW (67%) is on agricultural land. That includes 1,276
GW on arable fields and 286 GW on abandoned farmland. Japan’s total solar capacity
stands at about 74 GW.

There are cases in which solar panels over farmland have been helping farmers
increase their crop. Farmclub, in Gunma Prefecture, runs a 16-acre farm with 111 kW
solar panels on top of greenhouses growing rockets and lettuce.


The yield from the greenhouses are three times more compared with farms nearby
that are without solar panels, according to the MAFF. Solar electricity generated from
the panels brings in ¥4.9 million a year. Income from the project over the 20 years is
estimated at ¥50 million.

Not all operators are complying
In April 2024, rule changes and a set of guidelines took effect detailing the criteria for
receiving ministry permission. Projects won’t be allowed if their yield drops more than
20%, if they fail to submit annual reports, and if panels are installed in ways hindering
the use of machinery on farmland. The move followed some projects prioritizing
power generation over farming, prompting the need to exclude such projects, the
MAFF said in a statement.

In August, the METI said it had suspended paying subsidies to 342 agrisolar projects
by 20 operators. Of them, 327 cases (14 operators) did not meet the criteria to receive
subsidies under the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme as they failed to receive permissions for
land conversion within three years of receiving FIT approval.

The rest of the projects were found at fault for failing to remove panels after the
duration of the temporary land conversion had expired, or not growing crops
properly.

Opportunities for new tech
The agricultural sector needs to decarbonize just like other sectors and that calls for
electrification of equipment and the heating source for greenhouses, Takeaki
Masukawa, Secretary-General of JPEA told Japan NRG. Solar panels can contribute to
the decarbonization of the agricultural sector and strengthen the business base for
farmers by supplying cheap solar electricity for self-consumption, he said.
Furthermore, excess solar power can be sold to increase profits while contributing to
the national decarbonization goals.

In July, Renewable Energy Institute (REI) said that among the potential sectors for
Japan’s solar deployment, immediate focus should be on utilizing buildings as it is not
difficult to install panels on buildings whether they are for residential or not. In the
meantime, developing agrisolar is a mid- and long-term effort that also calls for
expanding a farming population.


Local governments should lead efforts in expanding agrisolar to leverage on strengths
unique to each region while aligning with national farming policies. Financial
institutions, especially regional banks, should provide support for local power
producers and power consumers, REI said.

Already, agrisolar is providing opportunities for new technologies and entrants.
Sekisui Chemical began a pilot project in Chiba prefecture with TERRA, a Chiba-based
company specializing in agrisolar and promoting the technology across Japan with its
group company Citizen Energy Chiba. The pilot will use Sekisui’s perovskite solar
panel on a curved surface.

Other agrisolar proponents are Kyocera and Sharp. Both led the early development of
PV in Japan before their market share was eclipsed by Chinese rivals. Sharp supports
farmers in finding the best ways to lay out power generation systems over their
farmland.

Attracting new farmers and expanding agriculture in Japan faces headwinds such as
the difficulty of securing land as well as high-cost investments in equipment. Kyocera

said it will start building greenhouses with rooftop panels for farmers so they can have
on-site solar generation at no initial cost. Instead, farmers will pay a monthly fee for
the equipment, according to a July press release.

Utility companies are also developing agrisolar projects. Chugoku Electric said in
January that its first agrisolar plant started operations and signed a power purchase
agreement with Toyo Kohan, a steel sheet maker.

The utility grows cleyera japonica, a type of shade plant that requires less sunlight and
allows for more panels to be installed over land. Chugoku plans to develop 64 MW of
agrisolar capacity for Toyo.

In April, Chubu Electric signed a loan agreement with JA Mie Shinren, an agricultural
bank in Mie Prefecture, for seven agrisolar projects with a combined capacity of 2 MW
in Mie. Chubu will also collaborate with JA Mie to promote decarbonization and
sustainable agriculture.

“The primary mission of solar panels is to play a supporting role to help farmers,”
Masukawa of JPEA said.


If more farmers are convinced, the potential for agrisolar in Japan could easily grow
from a niche to a renewables mainstay.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Solar power
Coal generated 49.1% of the country's electricity, while renewables accounted for
48.7%. Climate finance expert Tim Buckley said August's record figures were caused
by strong winds and a warm start to spring that reduced demand on the grid by up to
20%.

China / Energy transition
Primary aluminum smelters are producing record volumes and the domestic market
surplus is exported in the form of semi-manufactured products. China's primary
aluminum production hit a monthly peak of 3.69 MMT in July, according to the
International Aluminium Institute.

China / Hydrogen
Chinese electrolyzer manufacturer Hygreen Energy and its partners will invest more
than €2 billion in green hydrogen projects in Spain’s region of Andalusia. The
electrolyser production factory will have a capacity of up to 5 GW, and will initially
focus on 5-MW electrolysers.

India / Biofuel
A push to make more corn-based ethanol has turned India (Asia's top corn exporter)
into a net importer for the first time in decades. The jump in import demand comes
after India in January hiked the procurement price of corned-based ethanol to drive a
shift away from sugarcane-based ethanol for blending in gasoline.

India / Power grid
As record-breaking heatwaves ravaged most of India earlier this year, thousands of
overloaded transformers on power lines were damaged and caught fire, causing 12-
hour-long blackouts even in big cities.

LNG
North America’s LNG export capacity is set to more than double between 2024 and
2028, from 11.4 Bcf/d in 2023 to 24.4 Bcf/d in 2028, if projects now under
construction eventually launch as planned.

LNG Carriers
Chinese shipyards are taking more market share in building LNG vessels. Strong
global demand for LNG has left shipyards in South Korea unable to meet the need for
new vessels. Although Chinese shipyards build 6% of the current fleet (by volume),
they are set to deliver over 20% of new LNG carriers on order. The average cost of
building an LNG carrier in China is about $247 mln, compared with $265 mln in South
Korea.

Malaysia / Aviation emissions
Malaysia aims for net zero emissions in its aviation sector by 2050, the transport
ministry said. The blueprint includes reducing carbon emissions by up to 18% in
