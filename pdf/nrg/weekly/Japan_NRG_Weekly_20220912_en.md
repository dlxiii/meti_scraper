METI launches new council on hydrogen for vehicles
(Government statement, Sept. 8)
•  METI launched a public-private sector council on hydrogen-driven vehicles; 21 representatives
from the automotive, logistics, retail and energy sectors are participating; A chairman hasn’t yet
been appointed.
•  The council seeks cross-industrial solutions to accelerate hydrogen-fueled vehicle use.
•  As of August, 160 hydrogen service stations are in operation and 18 are under construction; As of

July, 7,418 fuel-cell cars and 120 fuel-cell buses were on the road.
•  2025 goals are 200,000 FCVs and 320 hydrogen service stations.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Toyota’s hydrogen-fueled vehicle sales slump to 10 vehicles in August
(Japan Automobile Dealers Association Data, Sept. 6)
o  Toyota’s domestic fuel-cell vehicle sales numbered just 10 in August, according to

JADA’s data. The company sold 28 EV vehicles during the month.
o  Toyota’s January-August FCV sales totaled 640 vehicles, down from 2,081 vehicles in the
same months last year.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan is falling behind its hydrogen strategy goals. In 2020, 40,000 hydrogen-fueled vehicles
were supposed to be on the road, instead of just 5,170 that there are today. There’s a wide gap between
Toyota's sales figures and the 2025 national target to increase FCVs to 200,000.




NRA to improve inspection processes
(Government statement, Sept. 7)
•  The Nuclear Regulation Authority said it will improve inspection processes. The NRA will clarify
items for inspection in advance and will be more flexible with scheduling; will increase on-site
inspections and clarify standards and guidelines.
•  NRA also urged companies to provide complete data to speed the process.
•  CONTEXT: Last month, PM Kushida called for more nuclear power reactors to come back online to

help alleviate the energy crisis. This requires greater cooperation between government agencies
and utilities.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
NRA chief rejects need to shorten inspection period
(Sept. 7, Kyodo)

o  Fuketa Toyoshi, head of the NRA, said there’s no need to reduce the time to complete
an inspection for nuclear restart approval. This was a counterargument to criticism aimed
at the agency that only 10 reactors have restarted 11 years since the Fukushima disaster.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  Power companies asked the NRA to host more meetings for reactor restart screening, but
Fuketa said that: “As the contributing factor of delay is the poor reaction of the power
companies, increasing meetings would not help with early restart”.
• TAKEAWAY: There is an obvious contrast between the statement issued by the NRA and the comments of its
chief. One way to explain this is to remember that Fuketa is due to step down soon. As detailed in the June

27, 2022 issue of Japan NRG, Fuketa’s five-year term is almost completed. On Sept. 22, he will be succeeded
by Yamanaka Shinsuke, a regulator the power industry believes is more amenable to their point of view. Before
he leaves, however, Fuketa wants to protect his legacy and push back against the political and commercial
forces attacking the NRA. His arguments are that restart delays are due to utilities not providing the agency
with necessary data. Utilities argue that the data requests are not always necessary or feasible. Who will win
this debate will become clearer once Fuketa’s successor is in place.



METI cautious over “anti-nuclear” Kono joining the Cabinet
(Sentaku, September 2022 edition)
•  METI is nervous about the inclusion of two leading members of the bipartisan parliamentary group

'Zero Nuclear Power', Digital Minister Taro Kono and Science Minister Keiko Nagaoka, in the
reshuffled cabinet.
•  After the Upper House election, METI planned to move quickly to restart nuclear power stations,
extend the operational period of reactors, and build new nuclear plants to tackle power shortages.
•  PM Kishida leans towards nuclear power’s return, but there’s a big risk that the Cabinet will oppose
this idea. Kono has been given the role of minister in charge of consumer affairs and is in a position

to criticize high electricity prices. Kono has taken a public stand on various issues since his
appointment, and a senior METI official fears he will do the same with energy.
•  METI Minister Nishimura is known for lacking familiarity with power system administration and
being too talkative, even regarding confidential information. Both nuclear and Sakhalin-2 are
sensitive issues. METI officials are worried that Nishimura is not “good enough” to take on Kono
and can’t keep secrets.



METI proposes larger state role in city gas
(Japan NRG, Sept. 6)
•  METI proposed expanding the state’s role in city gas supply and will establish a new framework,
similar to that for the power sector.
•  Like in the power sector, Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) may source
the gas for city gas operators when in need.
•  City gas operators and big consumers discuss conservation in times of extreme tightness and

implement measures on mutual consent.
•  The METI minister has the authority to order power consumption cuts, but this authority won’t
extend to city gas.

MoE asks localities to send info on offshore wind environmental assessment process
(Kankyo Business, Sept. 8)
•  MoE launched a public call for information from localities around environmental impact
assessments for offshore wind power projects. This relates to areas designated as "promotion

areas" or "promising areas". The deadline is Oct. 7.
•  The ministry aims to collect information on areas where offshore wind power is expected to be
installed, and to provide the compiled information to operators and local governments from a
database. This should streamline the environmental impact assessments.


Japanese firms move towards testing of solid-state batteries

(Asia Nikkei, Sept. 9)
•  Solid-state batteries are seen as a potential game changer in electric cars. Some Japanese
companies are nearing the phase of testing these next-generation power sources.
•  A Nippon Steel unit plans to launch a testing service near Osaka by March 2023, which will extend
as far as building prototypes based on designs provided by battery makers. A unit of Oki Electric
Industry will begin offering reliability testing this month, focusing first on batteries for electronics

and later on EVs.
•  Testing will become important as the batteries make their way into electric vehicles. Their quality,
safety and reliability will determine EV's overall performance.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan raises concern over U.S. eligibility rules on EV subsidies
(Asia Nikkei, Sept. 9)
o  Requirement of North America assembly will exclude most Japanese models. New METI

minister Nishimura voiced this concern with Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo
during a visit to the U.S.


Iwatani, Obayashi test Japan’s first use of liquid hydrogen as cold heat for buildings

(New Energy Business News, Sept. 6)
•  Iwatani Corporation and Obayashi Corporation will be the first in Japan to jointly test the use of
liquefied hydrogen as cold heat for buildings.
•  The test will take place at the Iwatani Hydrogen Technology Laboratory (Amagasaki City, Hyogo
Prefecture). Various means, methods, and applications will be developed for the test, including
using cold water for air conditioning, cooling water for laboratory equipment, and ice thermal
storage.
•  CONTEXT: Liquefied hydrogen is hydrogen gas liquefied at -253°C.



Azerbaijan, Moldova join JCM
(Government statement, Sept. 7)
•  Azerbaijan is the 20th and Moldova the 21st country to join the joint credit mechanism (JCM), a
bilateral carbon credit mechanism under the Paris Agreement.
•  CONTEXT: The two countries have low carbon footprints. Azerbaijan’s share of global GHG

emissions is 0.16% and Moldova, 0.03%.

JERA director resigns to take up post with U.S. Dept. of Energy
(Company statement, Sept. 9)
•  JERA announced that one of its directors, David Crane, resigned. He was appointed Director of
the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) at the U.S. Dept of Energy (DOE), effective

Sept 6.


Tokyo mandates solar panels for new detached households
(Prime Online, Sept. 9)
•  Starting April 2025, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government will mandate installation of solar panels
for all newly detached houses. This goes for major construction companies and not the owners.
•  The Tokyo Government has been promoting solar, with panel installation subsidies and building
leases for solar at home with no initial cost. The Govt says this is Japan’s first compulsory rule for
solar panel installation.



Itochu to work with Sasol on Green Ammonia Project
(Denki Shimbun, Sept. 5)
•  Itochu signed an MOU to develop green ammonia projects with South Africa’s Sasol. Green

ammonia is made of hydrogen produced by renewable energy.
•  The two will jointly study the development of an ammonia supply chain including a green ammonia
production facility that Sasol plans in Northern Cape province. The study will include an export-
oriented project of green ammonia for power applications, bunker fuel, and more.



Rokkasho completion date pushed back again

(Asahi Shimbun, Sept 8)
•  Japan Nuclear Fuel told the Aomori government that the Rokkasho nuclear fuel reprocessing plant
won’t be completed in the first half of FY2023 as planned.
•  In January, the NRA said the scheduled completion date was “very ambitious”.
•  This is the 26th delay since construction began in 1993; a series of problems caused project costs
to balloon from ¥760 billion to ¥3.1 trillion.
•  A director at a major power company criticized the latest delay, saying Rokkasho was holding the

nuclear industry back at a time when the government was trying to promote nuclear energy.
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies said if Japan’s nuclear fuel industry is to have a future,
then Rokkasho, which already stores 3,000 tons of spent fuel rods, must start reprocessing.
• TAKEAWAY: Rokkasho’s role is enrichment of uranium, reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, temporary storage
of nuclear fuel materials and waste returned from overseas reprocessing plants, disposal of low-level
radioactive wastes, and fabrication of MOX fuel. With so many functions hanging on this facility, and so much

time and money already spent, this plant is very much in the too-big-to-fail category.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Mutsu City imposes new tax on storage of used nuclear fuel

(Sept. 6, To-o Nippo)

|  |

o  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications approved Mutsu City’s request for a
new tax on spent nuclear fuel of ¥620/ kg.
o  This tax will generate revenue of over ¥100 billion for Mutsu City (Aomori Prefecture),
which is home to the Recyclable-Fuel Storage Center (RFSC) built by TEPCO and Japan
Atomic Power Company (JAPC).

o  Used nuclear fuel produced at TEPCO and JAPC plants and sent to the RFSC will be
stored in steel containers until sent to the reprocessing facility at Rokkasho. The RFSC will
be inspected by the NRA, and is expected to start operation in FY2023.
• TAKEAWAY: As there is no location selected as the site for the final storage of nuclear waste, the material will
be kept at the RFSC in Mutsu City for now. Thus, this new city tax is a sort of consolation money from TEPCO
to the city. Also, the Aomori Prefecture governor wants additional taxes.




Why we should extract uranium from seawater

(JB Press, Aug. 22)
•  CONTEXT: This article is by Canon Institute for Global Studies director Sugiyama Taishi.
•  While uranium ore deposits are finite, enough of the radioactive metal is dissolved in seawater to
meet humanity’s uranium needs for 60,000 years.
•  Japanese research into extracting uranium from seawater was suspended after the 2011 Fukushima
disaster, but recent high energy prices and ambitious emissions targets mean Japan should invest
in the technology again.
•  Generation of electricity from uranium extracted from seawater is about ¥2/ kWh, more costly than

generating electricity from mined ore.



JAIST team boosts lithium-ion battery capacity
(Nikkei X-Tech, Sept. 5)
•  Researchers at the Hokuriku-based Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have
developed an anode manufacturing technology that inexpensively boosts the capacity of lithium-

ion rechargeable batteries.
•  By replacing conventional nano silicon particles with micro silicon, the technology reduces
expansion and contraction upon charging and discharging.

Power prices hit price cap of ¥200 due to extreme heat: JEPX
(JEPX report, September edition)
•  JEPX reported that power futures hit the ¥200/ kWh price cap for the Tokyo Area in 10 time slots
on Aug 3. The Tohoku Area saw ¥200/ kWh pricing for all 10 slots.
•  The Tokyo area reached ¥200/ kWh on June 29 (four straight slots), and on July 1 (six slots

continuously).
•  On Aug 3, the Tokyo area’s power demand reached 58,880 MW for the first time in 12 years,
because the temperature soared over 36 degrees Celsius.
• TAKEAWAY: Such extreme prices make it almost impossible for new relaters, also known as Power Producer
and Suppliers (PPSs) to supply their customers. Thus, the number of consumers who switched back from PPSs
to the major regional power utilities is up by a factor of 80 compared to a year earlier (35,435 switches Vs 438).




Mitsubishi and Kajima tussle over who will accept losses from offshore wind projects
(Diamond, Sept. 6)
•  The article says that already thin profit margins for the three offshore wind projects won by

consortia led by Mitsubishi Corp have been eroded by rising resource costs. Now, the trading
house and its major general contractor, Kajima Corp, are wrangling over who will swallow the
additional cost burden. Mitsubishi wants the contractor to bear a portion of the losses.
•  Kajima teamed up with Dutch marine engineering giant Van Oord on the construction work for the
three projects in Akita and Chiba Prefectures. Kajima is also responsible for the construction of
Marubeni's first commercial offshore wind power projects in Akita City and Noshiro City, Akita

Prefecture.
•  The Japanese construction firm has built up a large pipeline of orders from the offshore wind
power sector. But higher material costs, yen depreciation, and soaring transport expenses are
driving up the construction price tag for projects like those led by Mitsubishi by at least 30%.



Weak yen adds to burden of Japanese utilities

(Yomiuri Shimbun, Sept. 8)
•  The yen hit the 144 per USD mark in Tokyo on August 7 for the first time in 24 years. With the yen
at a historic low, the corporate earnings of utilities are under further pressure due to rising cost of
raw materials import.
•  Exporters in the Kansai region benefited from the yen's depreciation in the past, but those benefits
have waned as production bases were relocated overseas.
Kansai Electric expects a loss of ¥75 billion this fiscal year due to the weak yen. It estimates that a

one yen depreciation increases costs by ¥8 billion.

Corporations scramble for solar panels as energy prices soar
(Kochi Shimbun, Sept. 5)
•  A weak yen and high fuel prices have led to a rapid increase in the number of commercial users
installing PV panels to offset electricity costs.

•  The semiconductor shortage, however, has businesses fighting over tight supply.
•  A local supermarket chain, which says its monthly power bill is more than ¥100 million, plans to
install 54 kW of solar capacity in December.
•  The company said while it will be difficult to recoup this investment under the feed in tariff (FIT)
scheme, by having stores use the electricity they generate, it’s possible in about seven years.




Influx plans giant offshore wind project in Chiba area

•  Influx Inc. plans to develop an offshore wind farm off the coast of Isumi City, Chiba Prefecture that
may be as large as 696 MW, according to its Environmental Assessment Consideration Report.
•  The project area is approximately 290 km2, which would house between 35 and 74 turbines. Some
turbines may be as large as 20 MW. The developer may use monopile, jacketed, or gravity type

turbine installations.
•  The area off the coast of Isumi City is organized as a "promising area" under the Renewable
Energy Sea Area Utilization Law, and Green Power Investment, Natural Power, Japan Renewable
Energy, and Renova are also conducting assessment procedures there.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Group led by Mitsui and RWE plan offshore wind project in Chiba area

(New Energy Business News, Sept. 7)
o  Mitsui, RWE Renewables, Osaka Gas, and K&O Energy Group seek to develop a landing-
type offshore wind farm off the coast of Isumi City, Chiba Prefecture that may be as large
as 495 MW, according to its Environmental Assessment Consideration Report.
o  The project area is approximately 9,590 ha, which would house between 33 and 42
turbines, the biggest of which would be 15 MW. Monopile, jacketed, and gravity-type
foundations are envisioned.




Chubu Electric eyes more offshore wind projects after Akita win
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Sept. 7)
•  Chubu Electric, which has a stake in the Akita Offshore Wind Farm (Akita City), plans to develop
more than 2 GW of renewable energy by around 2030.
•  CONTEXT: A unit of Chubu partnered with Mitsubishi Corp to win all three major offshore wind

tenders held by Japan last year.
•  After the Akita win, Chubu Electric plans to develop large-scale projects with a total output of

East-West Nuclear Divide Among Challenges
Kishida’s GX Agenda Seeks to Tackle

It’s a Tale of Two Regions when it comes to nuclear power in Japan. In the West, the
atom continues to generate electricity at close to pre-Fukushima levels. In the East,
there’s the Big Nuclear Freeze.

Although the nuclear units across Japan vary by age, reactor technology, operator,
and even years spent in the crosshairs of the industry regulator, nothing divides the
ones online from those gathering dust as much as geography. The nearest operating
nuclear plant to Tokyo is 330 kilometers (204 miles) away.
Last month, Prime Minister Kishida vowed to support the restart as many as 17
reactors by next summer. That’s more than half of the operable units at the country’s
disposal. But as things stand, there won’t be a restart of a nuclear generator east of
the Kansai border for at least another 16 months.

This matters because the restart of more nuclear facilities is one of the government’s
core routes to easing Japan’s power shortages. Yet with the volume of electricity able
to move between East and West Japan very small, nuclear energy’s impact on power
supply and prices for the Tokyo, Chubu Tohoku and Hokkaido regions may be
severely limited.



Kishida’s determination
Soon after the second meeting of Kishida’s GX (Green Transformation)
Implementation Council, the PM announced a fundamental shift in nuclear policy.
Citing a change in the global oil and gas markets since the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, Kishida said Japan will need to secure stable energy supplies in order to
continue the clean energy transition.

The premier noted that the power balance is especially poor in Japan’s eastern
regions that include the capital. Kishida warned that such imbalances, among other
factors, could slow the GX agenda, delaying the rollout of more renewables, upgrade
of the power grids, and the adoption of energy storage and offshore wind.

In other words, without a stable power system today and in the near term, Japan risks
failure to reach its 2050 carbon neutrality goals. The government’s solution to secure
energy supplies for the winter and years after is, largely, to re-engage with nuclear
generation.

Beyond the 10 reactors already restarted, Kishida said he wants to help other units
that have the regulator’s safety approval to reach the starting line. The Nuclear
Regulation Authority has officially approved 17 units for a restart.


Realistic review of the situation
In addition to Kishida’s comments, a more detailed overview of the nuclear policy was

distributed by the new METI and GX minister Nishimura via a document titled “The
Recreation of Energy Supply Security for Japan.”

This is what it proposed:


•  This winter: ensure nine nuclear units are online

Kishida’s plan will try to coordinate maintenance schedules of already restarted
reactors to keep 9 reactors online this winter during the peak demand period. All
these units are in West Japan. Therefore, this policy won’t alleviate the power crunch
in East Japan.

•  Support restart of regular-approved units

After the industry regulator, the NRA, gives its approval for a restart, a reactor needs to get
a green light from the local authorities. This is not a legal mandate, but is the way the
industry operates in Japan. The social license dispersed by the municipality and prefecture
is seen to be vital in showing the public’s support for nuclear facilities.
At the moment, of the 17 units approved for restart by the NRA, seven need a local green
light and of those, four are in the East. Should all of these restart, East Japan would get an
additional 5.46 GW of capacity, which would be enough to avert a crunch in the Tokyo
area during peak demand times.

Currently only two of the above (Takahama Units 1 and 2) are planned to come online
by next summer. Of the East-based reactors, the earliest due online is Onagawa NPP’s

most complex as the utility needs to meet additional requirements on top of its
equipment review due to a string of scandals around security.

Similarly, Shimane NPP needs additional approvals, while J-Atomic Power’s Tokai NPP
is not scheduled to complete safety upgrades until September 2024.

•  Replace aged reactors

METI’s document stated the need to replace aging reactors. That was another drastic
policy change as the idea was entirely denied just three months earlier at a government
meeting in Fukui Prefecture, home to 15 reactors.
Luckily, Fukui’s large reactor fleet and the jobs and revenue that comes with that put local
authorities in a pro-nuclear mindset. So, the Fukui Governor saw the policy change as a
positive. Soon after, the Mayor of Takahama City in Fukui, which hosts a namesake NPP,
visited the METI Minister to push forward the replacement agenda. Another local mayor,
for Mihama City, also made supportive comments.

This indicates that the building of new reactors on the sites of aged units seems most likely
to proceed first in Fukui. The chair of a local economic federation had petitioned for just
this with METI and its Agency for Natural Resources and Energy during a visit prior to the
GX Council meeting.


•  Construct advanced nuclear reactors

METI’s plan also called for the construction of new reactor technologies (covered in detail
in the Aug. 22, 2022 edition of Japan NRG). The sites and operators for these are not yet
clear. However, given that the three main technologies to be deployed are advanced PWR,
High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) and Small modular reactors (SMRs), we
can make an educated guess.

PWR technology is currently only used in West Japan and on the northern island of
Hokkaido. The latter is unlikely to host new nuclear plants as the island is a net energy
seller with big plans for offshore wind projects. Of the three utilities with PWRs in the West,
Kansai Electric seems the most likely operator based on local grid balance issues.
A small 30-MW HTGR has operated in Ibaraki Prefecture since 1998. The operator, Japan
Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), was recently announced as a partner for the UK’s program
to build gas-cooled reactors in the country. The UK government assumes it can build and
start a local HTGR in the early 2030s. JAEA would likely seek to build another HTGR in
Japan around the same time or earlier, and would probably use the same site in Ibaraki.

There are no details for SMRs, but Japanese media has speculated that one of the first
units could be built at Kansai Electric’s Mihama or Takahama or Ohi NPP stations to
replace their aging units. Another firm with interest in the technology appears to be Chubu
Electric.
With the nuclear divide so stark in Japan, it’s hard to imagine new unit construction in the
East. Yet, unless Kishida manages to revive the use of nuclear power more evenly around
the country, the nationwide energy system could remain unbalanced for much of this
decade.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Profile: NGK Insulators, Future Battery Superstar or Messy Outlier?

A shift to using weather-dependent energy sources like solar and wind requires ample
and reliable power storage. So far, most attention has focused on lithium-ion batteries
to fill that role, but the challenges there include inadequate supply and the price of
lithium metal. One Japanese company, however, believes it has a better alternative.

NGK Insulators is a century-old ceramics maker headquartered in Nagoya, the city
that’s also home to Toyota Motor. Unlike the automaker, NGK is hardly a well-known
brand. It excels in niche areas such as porcelain insulators for power lines and sensors
for engine exhaust, but it also has developed battery tech that promises to be the
ultimate low-cost energy storage solution.

What’s more, NGK’s sodium-sulfur (NAS) storage battery is not just a concept. NGK
has succeeded in installing 700 MW/ 4,900 MWh (output/ capacity) of its tech at home
and abroad. The UN’s Industrial Development Organization even offers NGK and its
sodium-sulfur batteries their own page on its website, rating this as one of the world’s
most prominent sustainable technology platforms.

With batteries sorely needed to develop new businesses such as power aggregation,
Virtual Power Plants (VPP) and more, NGK’s offering should be a shoe-in for success.
Comments from end-users, however, indicate a more nuanced picture for NAS
batteries. And despite their premise, NGK is struggling to turn a profit from the
business.


A century of innovation
NGK Insulators is the world’s sole producer of commercial scale NAS storage
batteries. The company claims it’s the only type of large-scale energy storage tech
that can be installed anywhere and used for both power plants and substations,
catering to industrial, commercial and residential clients alike.

NGK was founded in 1919 as a spin-off of a tableware and technology company now
known as Noritake. In the early 20th century, Noritake split off its sanitary division into
a separate business. One part became Japan’s top toilet maker, Toto, while another
was carved out again as NGK Insulators.

NGK focused on producing ceramic insulators to meet electrification demand, then
branched off into spark plugs, water systems and other businesses. In 1984, it made a
strong push in energy storage, partnering with TEPCO to develop a new kind of
battery system that would balance out the rapid growth in energy demand.

The concept of NAS was originally outlined by Ford Motor in the late 1960s, but went
nowhere. TEPCO wanted to see if it could replace hydropower stations as a way of
balancing power supply and demand.

NAS uses sulfur in the battery cathode; sodium, an alkali element similar to lithium, in
the anode; and a ceramic electrolyte. The battery mechanism is akin to lithium-ion

units. Sodium ions flow between the cathode and anode in the electrolyte to release
electricity.

TEPCO was drawn to the concept since its energy storage potential was four times
that of lead storage batteries. The utility worked with NGK for 20 years, long after
most in the U.S. and Europe abandoned the concept. In 2002, the Japanese partners
succeeded in bringing NAS tech to a commercial level and installed the first system at
TEPCO facilities. The following year, NGK Insulators launched a battery manufacturing
line with an output capacity of 60,000 kW/ year.

To date, NGK says it has installed a total capacity of 4,900 MWh in 250 locations
across 10 countries.

NAS battery raw materials
One main feature of NAS batteries is the low cost of key ingredients – sulfur, sodium
and alumina powder are in abundant supply. What’s more, the supply of sodium
metal is quite secure since MSSA, the world’s largest manufacturer based in France, is
owned by Nippon Soda, a Japanese company.


NAS battery costs              Lithium-ion battery costs
Sodium metal: $300-350/ ton    Lithium carbonate: $70,000/ ton
Alumina: $400/ ton             Nickel: $20,000/ ton
Magnesium oxide: $2,000-$3,000/ ton Cobalt: $70,000/ ton


In total, the storage cost for lithium-ion batteries amounts to ¥200,000/ kWh, while for
NAS it’s ¥25,000/ kWh, says energy storage system integrator Renove Station. Also,
the carbon footprint of NAS units is low compared to lithium-ion batteries as most
supplies can be sourced in Asia. Nickel, cobalt and lithium, however, have to travel
from mines in Africa or South America to processing plants in China and elsewhere
before arriving in Japan.


Poor financial performance
NAS systems have an energy density three times those of lead batteries, high charge/
discharge efficiency of 75-90%, and a long operating life of 15 years or 4,500 cycles.
That’s attracted strong interest in NAS tech as nations seek to improve energy storage
options. It has not, however, translated into outright business success for NGK.

Despite the battery boom, nearly ¥3 billion in sales from NAS batteries accounts for
less than 1% of NGK’s total revenue. Further, the pandemic-induced disruption of
global supply chains sent the NAS business unit into the red.

Operating loss of NGK’s energy and industry segment
Year (April to March)          Operating loss

2020                         ¥4.9 billion
2021                         ¥1.4 billion
2022 (forecast)                 ¥2.9 billion

While NAS batteries are a low-cost solution for customers, NGK barely reaps financial
rewards, partly because of the high operating and maintenance costs. NAS requires a
constant environment of above 300 °C. Because it uses sodium, classified as a toxic
substance, anyone in possession of over 2 kg must report to authorities. It’s also
flammable when in contact with moisture or steam and releases toxic gas.

After suffering a well-publicized fire incident in 2011, NAS technology has been
improved to prevent fire from spreading. NGK also added advanced safety features
such as remote surveillance systems and developed container-packed NAS battery
systems to speed up installations.

But some users remain nervous. Energy storage systems are vital in times of
emergency, so there’s little tolerance for equipment risk.

To improve trust, NGK is changing its approach to work closely with NAS battery
users after installation, essentially partnering with them as an operator of power
supply. It has formed joint ventures with utilities such as Ena Electric Power and Chubu
Electric Miraiz.

The ceramics maker now needs to move quickly to boost returns while helping more
end-users adopt NAS technology. With so many new battery technologies on the
horizon and vast funding pouring into the sector, there’s always a chance the market
will find a new ultimate low-cost battery solution.

NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Brazil/ Renewable energy
The country added 650 MW of new power capacity last month. Renewables
accounted for 98%, with solar farms responsible for 57% of the total added in August;
wind farms accounted for 34%.

California/ Energy crisis
A heatwave pushed electricity demand to record highs, and the state extended
emergency action to conserve energy. The heatwave is a record for September, with
the threat of blackouts as people crank up the AC to stay cool.

Coal prices
Asian thermal coal prices hit a record high, driven by growing demand in Europe after
the region banned Russian imports. The Australian benchmark for high-quality
physical coal hit a record $438.94/ ton on Sept. 2, up from $433.24 the previous
week.

Egypt/ Green ammonia
Saudi Arabia’s Alfanar signed a MoU with Egypt to build a $3.5 billion green ammonia
facility. The project will use renewable energy sources to produce 500,000 tons of
green ammonia from 100,000 tons of green hydrogen every year.

EU/ Energy crisis
Member states are urged to tax revenues of non-gas electricity producers when prices
exceed €200/ MWh, which is now the EU average, and 10 times higher than the
average for the past 10 years. Excess revenues will be redistributed as relief to
companies and households. Wholesale electricity prices have soared because they’re
pegged to the price of gas, whether or not the electric power is produced with gas or
by other means.

Germany/ Energy crisis
Non-gas electricity producers will face a windfall tax. The money will help finance a
new €65 billion relief package to combat high energy bills. Also, Germany will keep
two nuclear power plants available as a last resort to get through the winter.

Metals/ Energy crisis
Eurometaux called on EU member states to take action to preserve their strategic
electricity-intensive industries and prevent permanent job losses, adding that the
energy crisis is an "existential threat to the future of Europe's metal smelters”.
Eurometaux has 26 company members including Glencore, Aurbubis, and Norsk
Hydro.
Nigeria/ Natural gas

Oil Minister Timipre Sylva said his country will send more LNG to Europe next winter,
but security issues are delaying deliveries. Nigeria will build a pipeline that will go
through Algeria on its way to Europe. The project will cost about $10 billion.

Spain/ Renewable energy
Repsol will sell a 25% stake in its exploration and production business to U.S.
investment group EIG for $4.8 billion. Spain’s biggest oil company is raising funds for
renewables investments. EIG is one of the private equity industry’s biggest oil and gas
investors.

UK/ Energy crisis
New PM Liz Truss proposed a £150 billion energy plan that includes a package to
protect households and businesses from rising prices. Household energy bills would
be capped at about £2,500 for the next two winters. The current cap is £1,971.
