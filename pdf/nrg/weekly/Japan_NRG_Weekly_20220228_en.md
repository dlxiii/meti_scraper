War in Ukraine
Kishida announces sanctions against Russia
(Nikkei, Feb. 25)
o  PM Kishida announced sanctions against Russia in response to what he described as an
attempt to unilaterally change the status quo by force.

o  The sanctions include freezing of assets of individuals and financial institutions,
suspension of visas, a ban on exports to organizations with military affiliations, and a ban
on the export of semiconductors and other goods.
o  He added that sanctions won’t directly interfere with Japan’s energy supply, saying that
Japan had around 240 days of both strategic and private sector oil reserves, and that gas
and electricity providers had two to three weeks of LNG reserves.
o  While the PM didn’t rule out scrapping price relief on gasoline, he said all options will be

considered to minimize the impact on consumers and businesses.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japanese government urges oil producing nations to boost output
(METI press release, Feb 23)
o  The latest situation in Ukraine has created additional pressure on oil prices.
o  Since the stability of oil markets is essential for the stability of the global economy, the

Japanese government urges oil producing nations to boost production and cooperate
with international organizations and major oil consuming nations.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
EU asks Japan for additional LNG shipments on Russia supply concerns
(Nikkei Asia, Feb. 26)
o  European Commission has asked Japan to send additional LNG cargos to Europe to

hedge against potential disruptions of Russian energy flows.
o  This comes after Japan has already diverted some LNG cargos to the EU for delivery in
March. The EU and Japan soon plan to discuss supply situation beyond this timeframe.
o  Japan’s government plans to survey domestic firms to understand the volumes that are
available, but would like to accommodate the EU request.
• TAKEAWAY: The Analysis section outlines the Russia-Japan energy ties and notes that Japan itself depends on
Russian LNG supplies for about 8-9% of its total. Should Russia decide to renege on its supply contracts due to

sanctions, both the EU and Japan would be affected. Further, Japan’s ability to cover any significant drop in
Russian gas volumes to Europe is limited.
• Rather than Russia unilaterally cutting energy exports, it is possible that flows will be disrupted by sanctions
against its financial system and logistics.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
LNG Buyers Struggle to Get Credit for Russian Shipments
(Bloomberg, Feb. 25)

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  LNG buyers in Asia struggle to secure credit lines from some Singapore banks for
purchasing shipments from Russia amid fears of further sanctions. The banks won’t issue
a standby letter of credit for buying spot shipments from Russia’s Sakhalin-II export
project.
o  CONTEXT: Cutting off the ability to purchase LNG from Russia could further tighten the

market, exacerbating a run-up in spot rates.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Expect higher prices not shortages on Ukraine crisis: Japanese energy firms
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 25)
o  JERA, which relies on Russia for less than 10% of its LNG requirements and just over 10%
of its coal requirements, plans to source commodities from Australia and other producers

if supply from Russia is interrupted.
o  Kansai Electric, which sources 15% of its coal from Russia, says supply is unaffected.
o  Tokyo Gas depends on Russia for about 10% of its natural gas supplies.
o  Rather than fuel shortages, skyrocketing prices is what the energy sector fears.



Japan to vet supply chains for chips, batteries under economic security law

(Nikkei, Feb. 26)

•  New Japanese economic security law aims to give the government power to review the supply
chains for semiconductors, storage batteries, rare-earth elements and other key products in order
to lessen foreign dependence.
•  Text of the bill was approved by the Cabinet and is expected to be ratified by parliament soon.
•  The law, which would come into force around FY2023, seeks to bolster domestic supply chains;

safeguarding key infrastructure; promote research in AI, quantum technology and other cutting-
edge fields; and limit the public disclosure of patents into sensitive technology that may have
military use.
•  Impact from the law incudes the need for companies in several industries, including electricity and
finance, to give the government advance notice on new equipment and suppliers.
• TAKEAWAY: In theory, this should bring more manufacturing back to Japan and encourage domestic
investment in new energy technologies, such as batteries. But Japanese businesses are wary of how the law

application will go and of the potential disruptions that will likely follow. Limiting supply of certain goods or
materials due to a lack of information about their origin could have serious near-term impact on prices and
production. Furthermore, even if repatriated Japanese supply chains would remain dependent on security of
raw materials, something that is not guaranteed in today’s more volatile geopolitical environment and with
rising resource nationalism. We expect this topic to continue to gather attention over the coming year.




CCS cheaper than ammonia/hydrogen co-firing: CRIEPI analysis
(Japan NRG, Feb. 24)
•  Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI)’s calculations showed that the power
generation cost of carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipped thermal power will be lower than
hydrogen or ammonia co-firing.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CCS-equipped LNG power plants generated power at ¥13.3/ kWh, while the costs of
ammonia/hydrogen co-firing of LNG plants came to ¥16.8-25.6 /kWh. CCS-equipped coal power
cost was ¥16.5/ kWh, while the costs of ammonia/hydrogen co-firing came to ¥20.8-27.9/ kWh.
•  The transport cost of the fuel, possibly from overseas, and the energy consumption for converting
the elements into liquids and to gas weigh on co-firing, its analysis showed.



Tokyo Gas and MHI to test carbon capture to help make synthetic methane
(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 25)
•  Tokyo Gas will start a demonstration test of carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU) with
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in January next year. A CO2 separation and recovery system will be

installed at a waste incineration plant in Yokohama City. It will be used as a raw material for
synthetic methane.
•  Some gas will be used for welding and beverage applications.
•  CONTEXT: Methanation does not increase the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere because it
captures CO2 emitted by factories before it’s released.
• TAKEAWAY: Synthetic methane, or methanation, has gained attention in Japan for its promise to act as a

“renewable” gas. Synthetic methane is seen as a way to decarbonize heat and can utilize existing natural gas
infrastructure.
• Methanation was discussed at a METI meeting with major gas companies this month. Japan’s top gas utilities
aim to have synthetic methane account for 1% of total city gas volumes by 2030, and want to grow that ratio.

• Synthetic methane is a cheap alternative to hydrogen in certain sectors. Japanese firms like Osaka Gas are also
banking on future R&D to make the cost of synthetic methane more economically efficient than hydrogen.




Japan to provide financing to ASEAN to cut 1 million tons of emissions
(Japan NRG, Feb. 21)
•  Japan plans to provide $50 million financing to cut 1 million tons of carbon emissions in the
ASEAN region by 2025, Masahiro Ishii of METI told the Clean Energy Future Initiative for ASEAN

forum.
•  METI and the Asian Development Bank plan an event on transition financing in the first half of this
year.
•  Japan will transfer decarbonization technologies through energy efficiency projects such as IoT
optimization of boiler and factory equipment called RENKEI, zero-emission buildings (ZEB), and
microgrids. Pertamina in Indonesia deployed RENKEI, and fertilizer plants in Thailand launched

feasibility studies in 2021. Malaysia plans to launch pilot ZEB projects this year.
• TAKEAWAY: $50 million is a small sum compared to the EU’s recent decision to grant a $237.6 million non-
refundable green transition aid to Vietnam over 2021-2024. At COP26, Vietnam vowed to phase out coal
power by 2040s.
• Improving energy efficiency is the fastest and less costly means to reduce carbon. Japan is also supporting

gradual energy transitions while retaining thermal power systems.

Decreasing power rates for steel, chemicals can help meet net zero goals
(Japan NRG, Feb. 21)
•  METI told the Industrial Structure Council for reviewing steel and chemical sectors that decreasing
power rates may speed up their transition to a carbon neutral economy. The measure may help

develop new technologies while continuing legacy operations.
•  Germany has cut power rates for power-intensive industries, which is a good example for Japan.
Steel and chemical companies are the two top carbon emitters outside the power sector.
•  Council members expressed divided views. The companies are exposed to international
competition while breakthrough technologies for zero carbon steel and chemicals have not been
established. Panelists pointed out stable steel and chemical supplies are key to national economic
security, but there’s a need to see if businesses are efficient. Taxpayers must be convinced these

sectors need to be protected.
•  CONTEXT: Key breakthrough technologies for steel are replacing coking coal with hydrogen. The
Green Innovation Fund will be providing ¥193.5 billion to finance one such tech: the hydrogen
reduction process. The Japan Iron and Steel Federation, however, has argued this amount is not
enough and overseas rivals get more support.
•  CONTEXT: Japanese steel mills run 15 GW of power plants, many coal-fired. Kobe Steel has even

been selling surplus coal-fired power to Kansai Electric since 2002.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Nippon Steel says its hydrogen consumption will hit 6-7 million tons
(Japan NRG, Feb. 21)
o  Nippon Steel president Hashimoto told the Industrial Structure Council its hydrogen
consumption is estimated to hit 6-7 million tons/ year if the hydrogen reduction process
replaces the coal-based process.

o  METI forecasts national hydrogen demand to be 20 million tons in 2050, suggesting
Japan may run short of hydrogen at the expense of steelmaking.
o  Hashimoto said Nippon Steel will restructure operations, cutting output of construction
and other low value steel by up to 20%.
• TAKEAWAY: Nippon Steel, JFE Steel and Kobe Steel dominate domestic production with over 70% of the
market. The survival strategy for 40 or so other smaller steelmakers is to focus on energy transition products:

Aichi Steel on EV and FCV components, Japan Steel Works hydrogen storages, and Daido Specialty Steel
nuclear power furnace structures.



METI identifies potential issues in counting total carbon in recycled fuel
(Japan NRG, Feb. 24)
•  METI reported to the Government-Private Council on Methanation key issues counting carbon of
recycled carbon fuel, to be shared with the MoE’s task force that determines methods of

measuring GHG emissions from CCU.
•  The issues are possibly double counting of carbon emissions from recycled carbon fuel (RCF) and
when the carbon is captured; counting carbon when RCF trades across borders; and the
methodology to measure carbon once it is re-used after long-term capture and storage.

Infrastructure Ministry plans carbon neutral port for Yamagata
(Kensetsu Shimbun, Feb. 24)
•  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport released a roadmap to create a carbon neutral
port in Sakata, Yamagata.
•  Of the 3.3 million tons of coal that pass through the port annually, 1.8 million tons is thermal coal
used for power generation.
•  The roadmap calls for the construction of biomass-fired power stations, wind farms and hydrogen

storage facilities near the port, the electrification of cranes and other waterside equipment, and the
introduction of fuel cell vehicles.
•  By 2030, utilities aim to halve CO2 emissions of the Sakata thermal power plant.



Solid-state batteries will not be a game changer: Opinion

(Nikkei X-Tech opinion, Feb. 22)
•  CONTEXT: This is a column by Furuno Shigeo, an executive fellow at SOKEN Inc., which is a
research institute founded by the 11 companies of Toyota Group. It pursues R&D in the
automotive field, including around the powertrain, fuel cells, and power electronics.
•  While many automakers are investing heavily in post-liquid lithium-ion battery research, short
battery life and other technical challenges mean solid-state batteries probably won’t make their

presence felt until after 2030.
•  Toyota announced in September that it’s developing a hybrid vehicle that would have an entirely
solid-state battery.
•  Nissan plans to build a solid-state battery production line by 2024/25, with a goal of achieving an
energy density double that of liquid lithium-ion batteries.




Former Japan Research Institute director skeptical about EVs
(Nikkei X-Tech, Feb 22
•  Despite the current hype around electric vehicles (EVs), exemplified by Tesla’s trillion-dollar market
capitalization, former Japan Research Institute Director Ikuma Hitoshi believes the EV market is a
bubble that will eventually burst.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  Ikuma stresses that EVs are only a means to an end and not the only technology that can help
reduce carbon emissions. The debate over EVs ignores the significant carbon emissions and
environmental impact from with their manufacture, he said.
•  The world’s two largest car markets placed bets on hybrid vehicles as opposed to purely electric
cars, and he says it doesn’t make sense to ignore this market.
•  In any case, Ikuma believes Japanese auto manufacturers would be unable to build an EV value

chain that rivals China’s, which holds significant lithium interests and whose government has
invested heavily in EV manufacture.
•  Rather than electrifying its vehicle fleet, Japan should leverage its existing transport infrastructure
and invest in Mobility as a Service platforms that reduce carbon emissions by combining various
forms of transport, says Ikuma.

Cost of nuclear plant safety upgrades since Fukushima now at ¥5.7 trillion
(Mainichi Newspaper, Feb. 25)
•  The total cost of safety measures taken by 11 power companies to restart nuclear power plants
after the accident at TEPCO's Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP exceeded ¥5.7 trillion as of January. This is
more than twice the amount initially expected.
•  The total what’s been spent and is expected to be spent, but there are several companies that do
not include certain costs in their calculations, such as for setting up anti-terrorism facilities. So, the

figure is expected to increase further.
•  The restart of nuclear plants after the Fukushima accident requires compliance with new regulatory
standards set by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA). So far, 27 reactors face examination by
the regulator with a view for restart.
•  Utilities said the costs have exceeded initial expectations due to additional measures requested by
the NRA based on its review of the facilities.
•  The biggest bill was for Kansai Electric, which restarted five of its seven units.



Mitsubishi’s offshore wind success has some locals upset over the selection process

(Nikkei Business, Feb. 23)
•  CONTEXT: In December, winners for the first three auctions of bottom-fixed offshore wind power
projects were announced. All three winners consisted of Mitsubishi Corp and a unit of Chubu
Electric. The lowest winning bid was ¥11.99/ kWh.
•  Some politicians are concerned that excessive focus on the lowest price in the recent offshore wind
capacity tenders could lead to future energy security problems. For example, it’s possible that a
Chinese consortium, backed by vast funds that support business, could offer the lowest price in a

future such tender.
•  Among the dissatisfied are locals from Akita Prefecture. They feel other companies were more
“sincere” with communities. A fisherman from Yusa, a town whose sea areas will be up for offshore
auctions, said if a similar selection process took place as at the end of 2021, many would not
support the results.
•  Without local buy-in, it will be hard to build up the offshore wind industry.
•  A foreign wind operator executive said it took Europe 30 years to lower offshore wind prices to the

current levels and that came after a buildup of the local supply chain, local industry, and
competition. In Japan, these were the first such tenders, so is it really possible to hit such a low
price?
• TAKEAWAY: More than two months after the tender results were published the debate about the outcome is
still strong. To make sure the sour mood does not derail the industry’s development, the government needs to
move ahead with more tender announcements. So far, that hasn’t been forthcoming. The Clean Growth

Strategy due to be announced sometime around April may help move the process forward.

(Denki Shimbun, Feb. 22)
o  Chubu Electric Power Grid (PG) said electricity demand in the Chubu area in January
increased 0.6%, YoY, to 12.142 billion kWh, a second consecutive month of YoY

increases. The main reason was higher heating demand.
o  Low-voltage power demand increased 0.7%, to 4.995 billion kWh, the highest for January
since 2005, when records began, due to heating and non-transport industry demand.

Japan weighs joining U.S. to tap oil reserves as crude tops $100
(Nikkei Asia, Feb. 25)
•  Japan considers releasing more oil from its reserves in coordination with the U.S. and other
countries as crude oil topped $100 per barrel.
•  The International Energy Agency is expected to begin talks soon with member nations such

as Japan, the U.S. and the U.K. regarding the crisis in Ukraine. Japan plans to respond should the
IEA call for a coordinated release of oil.
•  Tokyo looks to tap private-sector reserves, which can be deployed more easily, in response to any
request by the IEA.
•  CONTEXT: Earlier media reports had said that METI plans to bring to market 0.6% of its total
strategic oil reserves, equivalent to 260 million liters or 1.6 million barrels. The oil will be sold via
tender on March 9 and delivered on and after April 20.



LNG stocks pick up from last week to 1.82 million tons

(Japan NRG, Feb. 23)
•  LNG stocks picked up to 1.82 million tons on February 20, up from 1.78 million tons a week earlier.
The level was lower than 2.3 million tons last February and the four-year monthly average of 1.98
million tons.
•  METI minister Hagiuda said the stocks were enough for the next 2-3 weeks and Japan has diverted
some February cargoes to Europe. More March cargoes will be shipped to Europe. No decision on

April cargo yet.


Aluminum prices hit record high of $3,450/ ton on Ukraine war

(Japan NRG, Feb. 25)
•  Aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange hit a record of $3,450/ ton following the Russian
invasion. Prices averaged $1,700/ ton in 2020 and to $2,550/ ton in 2021.
• TAKEAWAY: The continual price surge will likely trigger material substitution by automakers, to switch to
galvanized steel that costs less than one third. Aluminum use in car bodies has increased due to light weight
requirements of low-emission vehicles. Steelmakers have developed thinner and lighter steel sheets with high-
tensile properties to compete against aluminum. Another switching alternative is resin.

• The aluminum price surge will also trigger switches in EV battery packaging material and other components.

ANALYSIS

BY YURIY HUMBER and
MAYUMI WATANABE

Overview of Russia-Japan Energy Relations:
Too Risky to Break, Too Small to Disrupt, But Metals Trade Key

In view of the events of last week, in which Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered
armed forces into Ukraine, we are providing an overview of the energy and
commodity ties between Russia and Japan, as well as a basic assessment of potential
sanctions.

Russia is one of the world’s most significant suppliers of oil, gas, coal and metals. It is
not, however, a significant energy supplier to Japan, despite being a neighbor. In
part, this is due to the fact that political relations between two nations have been
limited by a number of key factors. Also, Japan is host to U.S. armed forces and is
arguably the closest American ally in the Pacific. Another is a post-World War II
territorial dispute over the islands north of Hokkaido that Russia calls the Kurils and
Japan the “Northern Territories”.

The island chain is close to rich fishing grounds and may have claim to offshore oil and
gas reserves, but the resources are not well known and are not thought to be the
major issue. The islands have symbolic meaning to both sides.

Previous Prime Minister Abe Shinzo invested a considerable amount of time and
diplomacy into brokering a resolution to the territorial dispute, meeting with President
Putin at least 26 times during his eight-year tenure. The two appeared to form a warm
working relation, but President Putin made it clear that Russia would not cede even
part of the disputed territory, leaving the talks at a dead end.

It’s often noted that Japan and Russia still haven’t officially signed a peace treaty after
World War II. The two have signed other treaties, however, which acknowledged the
end of hostilities, and therefore this alone is not a strong issue for Japanese business
operating in Russia. Toyota Motor, Nissan, and Komatsu are some of the Japanese
manufacturers that set up factories in Russia over the last 10-15 years. Mitsui & Co.
and Mitsubishi Corp. trading houses were early investors in oil and gas projects on the
Sakhalin Island.

Despite these few headline investments, Japanese business has been wary of
expanding ties with Russia and further economic integration, and former PM Abe’s
efforts did little to turn the tide. Politics serve as a backdrop, but the most acute
reason has always been Russia’s business environment, which is viewed by Japan as
risky due to the volatility of the local currency, corruption, and geopolitical constraints.

In fact, trade between Russia and Japan is almost half of where it was in 2012.
Economic relations were decimated by the 2014 Russian claim to the Crimea and the
sanctions that followed.

Finally, Russia is a major wheat exporter. Although Japan is not thought to have direct
wheat purchase contracts with Russia, if the latter’s supply does not reach global

markets the price of the grain would rise and affect Japanese purchases from other
suppliers.

Bottom line: Japan cannot easily substitute Russian supply of aluminum or palladium,
and would find it difficult to find alternatives for LNG. However, even if Japanese
imports are not disrupted, a major risk for the economy lies in commodity price spikes
and inflation.

It’s unlikely that Japan would support sanctions against Russian commodity suppliers,
even in areas that it can find other sources of supply. It’s also unlikely that Russia
would wish to lose Japan as a buyer by withholding key exports.

The biggest knock-on effect, then, is likely to be on new investments, including in
energy, and technology transfer.

Trade
In 2021, Japan exported ¥862 billion worth of goods to Russia while importing ¥1.54 trillion, resulting in a
net trade deficit of ¥692 billion. These are just a fraction of Japan’s ¥18 trillion exports and ¥20 trillion
imports to and from China.

Trade with Russia has recovered in the last five years after the post-Crimea sanctions, especially in terms of
exports, which are up 56% since 2016.

Japan Exports to Russia, in USD















Energy supply
There are no gas or oil pipelines between Russia and Japan, though several projects have been proposed.
This lack of infrastructure is one reason for the relatively small volumes of Russian oil and gas in Japan, but
the key factor has always been concern about geopolitical risk.

In the last five years, Russian companies have offered Japanese investors stakes in several new LNG
developments – in Vladivostok and in the Arctic. In 2019, Mitsui and state-owned JOGMEC Corp. jointly
acquired 10% of the Arctic LNG 2 development, which is led by Russia’s Novatek. The Project will
commence production starting in 2023, with LNG aimed for delivery mainly to Asia and Europe. Japanese
banks are among the major financiers of the Arctic LNG 2 project.

Russia and Japan have also signed various agreements in the nuclear sector, though there are no major
bilateral projects between the two at this moment.

LNG
Pre-pandemic, Russia accounted for 8% of Japan’s LNG imports, with about 6.4 million tons of the fuel.
Last year, this share was slightly higher at 9%, but the volume was only slightly higher at 6.57 million tons.
Almost all Russian LNG that comes to Japan is sourced from the Sakhalin developments in which trading
houses Mitsui and Mitsubishi are co-investors.

Japan Follows the UK Down the Power Deregulation Rabbit-Hole

I once interviewed an economist in Tokyo about Japan’s energy market deregulation.
I asked him which country or market Japanese government officials looked to as an
example of successful electricity and gas market liberalization. Without hesitating, he
said: “The UK.”

Britain’s experiment with privatization in the 1980s, followed by successive bouts of
energy market reform throughout the 2000s and 2010s, became a global reference.
Unbundling vertically integrated monopolies and exposing incumbents to
upstream/generation and retail competition was seen as a winning formula. Cutting
the red tape unleashed market efficiencies, which lowered prices for end consumers
— until energy markets crunched, that is.

I wonder what the same Japanese economist would make of the implosion of the UK
energy retail segment. Regulator Ofgem recently approved an eye-watering 54%
increase in the retail price cap, which will push millions of households towards energy
poverty. Further rises are expected in October, and with increasing frequency
thereafter to keep up with an erratic market.

The regulator was caught between competing priorities: protect customers, or allow
loss-making suppliers to recover ballooning wholesale costs from consumers. After
bailing out major independent utility Bulb, political appetite for further intervention is
low. Ofgem chose to hike the cap to prevent further supplier failures. Cue much hot
air from politicians (although sadly not enough to keep the homes of energy-poor
Britons warm this winter).

The 2021-22 winter won’t be a one-off. The combination of liberalization and
decarbonization is a recipe for volatility. The switch to short-term market-based gas
pricing slashed billions of dollars off European import costs over the past decade, only
for those savings to be almost entirely wiped out in a matter of months when global
LNG prices spiked last autumn. Wholesale gas and power prices remain inflated and
the cost to consumers will keep stacking up until the market cools off and losses are
settled.


Red tape meltdown
Regulators and politicians will need to get used to making difficult trade-offs as the
energy transition progresses. Import-dependent Japan is facing the same challenges.
All of Japan’s 10 regional utilities slashed their earnings estimates for this business
year on soaring oil, gas and coal prices.

Japan arrived late to the deregulation party, thanks partly to the physical
segmentation of its power grid into two distinct networks running at different
frequencies, and the lack of interconnection between regional natural gas distribution

19

networks. These barriers perpetuated the natural monopolies presided over by state-
run or municipal utilities.

The Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011 was like an electric shock to Japan’s leisurely
deregulation agenda. The slow-burn liberalization of energy retail and trade gained
momentum after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, meltdown and subsequent shutdown
of the entire nuclear fleet. Operator of Fukushima nuclear plants, TEPCO, had long
resisted liberalization, as had many of the EPCos. But TEPCO’s bailout and partial
nationalization swept away that resistance, accelerating the legal unbundling of
transmission and distribution networks and ushering in competition across all energy
retail segments.


Silent nuclear fallout
The post-Fukushima nuclear shutdown forced Japan to buy vast volumes of LNG from
global suppliers to replace lost capacity. But it is less widely appreciated that the wave
of deregulation that followed eroded the confidence of incumbent utilities to commit
to long-term procurement of energy from global suppliers.

The old monopoly structure gave regulated utilities domestic demand certainty. The
obligation to meet the needs of a captive consumer base created a fixed demand
anchor, which drove EPCos to sign long-term LNG supply and purchase agreements
with global sellers.

Retail competition means that that certainty is diminishing, exacerbated by
demographic changes and the decarbonization megatrend. Japan is ramping up its
renewables deployment to help meet the CO2 reduction targets, all the while unsure
when most of its nuclear reactors can be restarted.

Japan’s commercial nuclear fleet has dwindled to 33 reactors today, of which only
seven are currently operational. The government is committed to restarting the rest
but the outlook for doing so is shrouded in uncertainty, amid continued skepticism
around nuclear among the population and strict safety requirements that the facilities
struggle to adhere to.


Fickle demand
Japan, for a long time the world’s biggest LNG importer, was last year overtaken by
China and its role in global gas markets is fading. Overall gas consumption peaked in
2014 at 124.8 billion cubic meters (Bcm), and has since fallen to 104.4 Bcm in 2020
according to BP data. Japanese LNG imports peaked in 2015 at 84.75 million tons,
and fell to 74.46 mt in the pandemic year of 2020.

These factors prompted TEPCO and Chubu Electric to join forces and launch joint
venture JERA to boost their LNG buying power in international markets. JERA has
since evolved to become one of the world’s largest LNG buyers, with an annual
transaction volume of around 40 million tons and sales of ¥2.7 trillion ($24.5 billion).

With rising commodity exposure and uncertainty over long-term demand trends in its
home market, risk management shot up the priority list for JERA. In response, the
company merged its LNG trading and optimization activities with those of EDF
Trading in 2019, giving rise to JERA Global Markets – which today operates one of

20

the largest seaborne energy portfolios in the world.

JERA’s highly sophisticated trading, optimization and risk management operation can
mitigate the downside risks of being caught long on LNG or coal in a global slump.
But it can’t nullify them completely.

So JERA’s recent decision not to renew a 25-year LNG sales and purchase agreement
(SPA) with Qatar must be understood in the context of market liberalization, Japan’s
overall diminishing and uncertain domestic gas demand profile, and increasing
seasonal swings in demand. The view is that demand is fickle, so contractual flexibility
trumps certainty.

JERA’s decision led to much diplomatic soul-searching in Tokyo and Doha. Qatar
helped keep the lights on in Japan by sending JERA wave after wave of spot LNG on
top of the amount it had contracted for. Riled by the snub, Qatar is quite happy to be
courted by the Biden administration as a potential savior should Russia's invasion of
Ukraine disrupt gas flows into Europe.

The Japanese government wants to be seen helping too, and asked Japanese LNG
buyers to divert LNG cargoes to Europe. JERA was apparently eager to help,
probably because it was diverting its US LNG cargoes to Europe anyway. Wholesale
gas prices on TTF, the European benchmark hub, are still comparable to spot prices in
Asia and the cost of transit is lower due to the shorter distance, so Europe offers
better margins.


Rudderless juggernauts
The bigger question for Tokyo is how to reconcile the commercial priorities of
companies operating in a liberalized market with the strategic priorities of
government. This question is further complicated by a structural dependency on
energy imports – a situation facing both the UK/Europe and Japan.

Due to its geography, Japan lacks natural resources like oil and gas – hence the
original push to power the island with nuclear in the 1960s. In Europe, declining
domestic oil and gas production is posing enormous strategic challenges.

Energy is the lifeblood of modern industrial economies. The world’s most advanced
economies took a relaxed approach to energy security and now often find themselves
competing in spot markets for scarce winter supplies of oil, gas and coal.

Privatization and deregulation meant outsourcing security of supply to ‘the market’.
Having embraced liberalization, the UK and Japan find themselves more exposed to
volatility, supply disruptions and domestic political repercussions whenever global
markets tighten.

This is problematic, because markets need more guidance than ever to navigate
the many contradictions at the heart of the energy transition. Expect the commercial-
political disconnect over energy to become increasingly pronounced.

transition (www.EnergyFlux.news). Energy Flux offers thoughtful and balanced analysis of decarbonisation
policies, and the trade-offs at the heart of the push for net zero.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Aviation/ Hydrogen fuel
By the end of 2026, Airbus will test a superjumbo A380 with hydrogen-powered jet
engines. The aviation industry is facing pressure to meet zero-emission targets by
2050. Aviation accounts for about 2.4% of global emissions.

Europe/ Natural gas
Top energy companies are buying more Russian gas, despite Russia’s invasion. As
prices rose more than 60% this week, power companies are making long-term
contracts with Gazprom. Russian gas imports are cheaper than spot gas traded at
European hubs.

Europe/ Wind power
A record 17.4 GW of wind power capacity was installed in 2021, up 18% YoY, said
WindEurope, adding that it’s not enough to meet energy and climate goals. By 2030,
the EU wants to cut GHG emissions by 55%.

Fossil fuels/ Financing
Blackstone said its private equity arm is ending investment in oil and gas exploration
and production. Blackstone’s credit arm will follow suit.
Germany/ Nord Stream 2
Wintershall Dea, a top investor in Nord Stream 2, wants compensation for its €730
million investment, if the pipeline doesn’t become operational. The German group is
one of five lenders to Gazprom for the project. The other four are Shell, Uniper, Engie
and OMV. The German government suspended Nord Stream 2 approval, due to
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iraq and Kuwait/ Renewable energy
Iraq and Kuwait plan renewable energy projects. Kuwait is developing a low-carbon
strategy for 2035, to focus on blue and green hydrogen. Also, the country plans 2 GW
in wind and solar capacity. Iraq is considering renewables as a way to end imports of
Iranian gas and electricity.

Methane emissions
Global methane emissions from the energy industry have been under-reported by
70%, the International Energy Agency said. Many GHG emissions totals submitted to
the United Nations by member states “have not been updated for years.”

Russia/ Coal
Coal prices are rising as the Russia-Ukraine war worsens. Also, Russian coal producers
face difficulties getting coal to their own export terminals. The country’s largest
producer, Kuzbassrazrezugol, asked customers to be allowed to postpone deliveries
for the 1Q and 2Q of 2022. Russia has a 20% share of global coal sales.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said "unidentified armed forces" took
control of the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The agency called for
"maximum restraint" to avoid risk at the facility. It added that Ukraine's four
operational nuclear power plants are secure.

U.S./ Wind power
The U.S. netted a record $4.37 billion from its largest-ever sale of offshore wind
development rights — for areas off the coasts of New York and New Jersey. On offer
were six leases covering 488,000 acres. Once completed, the project could produce
about 7 GW.
