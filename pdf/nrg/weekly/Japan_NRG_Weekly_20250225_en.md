NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


METI’s hydrogen official confident that Trump will support sector

(Japan NRG, Feb 19)
•  Hirota Daisuke, director of the Hydrogen and Ammonia Division at ANRE, said that despite
uncertainty over the new U.S. stance on the hydrogen sector, he was confident that President
Trump will support it.
•  As a businessman, Trump will see the benefit of U.S. hydrogen and ammonia exports on the trade
relationship between the countries, said Hirota at Smart Energy Week in Tokyo. The White House
will likely favor ‘blue’ hydrogen and ammonia projects over ‘green’ ones.
•  Hirota said the hydrogen industry faces a difficult challenge of building supply and demand at the
same time, but felt confident that Japan will back both with the ongoing Contract for Difference
(CfD) tender.
•  CONTEXT: CfD offers to pay low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia buyers the difference between
continuing to buy fossil fuels and switching to cleaner hydrogen or related fuel alternatives. The
subsidies would offer price-gap support for 15 years but are conditional on those awarded maintaining
deliveries for a further 10 years.
•  After the 15 year period, Japan’s carbon credits market should be fully active and able to support
the profitability of the hydrogen and related fuels sector, Hirota said.
• TAKEAWAY: The status of subsidy and tax credit support for U.S. hydrogen and ammonia projects has been
unclear since Trump ordered a freeze on the distribution of funds from the previous administration’s Inflation
Reduction Act program. Japan has implied many times that its own subsidies on the hydrogen user side could
be supplemented by other countries’ subsidies on the supplier side. U.S. developers of hydrogen and related
products are confident that some IRA funding or tax credits will still be available. In a related matter, Australia’s
parliament passed into law earlier this month a substantial hydrogen support program that offers producers
subsidies, especially of ‘green’ molecules, so they can compete in export markets. Bid submissions in the CfD
auction are due by late March.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Japan, U.S., and S Korea to research on hydrogen and advanced technologies
(Nikkei, Feb 20)
o  Japan, the U.S., and South Korea will set up a research framework in FY2025, for
advanced technologies essential for economic security. There will be four key projects, one

of which will focus on hydrogen production.
o  A total of ten national laboratories from the three countries will take part in the initiative.
From Japan: the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the
National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience, and the Japan
Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. The U.S. will have two research
institutes, including Sandia National Laboratories.
o  The initiative aims to develop technologies to purify and store hydrogen efficiently, and at
a lower cost using AI and other advanced techniques.
o  CONTEXT: The group will also research advanced computers, earthquake, and climate change
predictions, and will use observational data on PM2.5 to build a climate model specialized for
East Asia.

Japan moving beyond renewables vs nuclear debate; investment key to net-zero: METI
(Japan NRG, Feb 19)
•  Japan is moving beyond the renewables-vs-nuclear debate to fully utilize all low-carbon energy
options, said Ito Sadanori, head of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Dept of ANRE
during Smart Energy Week.
•  The government sees its role as promoting investment in clean energy and financing for large-scale
projects, Ito said. METI’s focus today is on:
o  Supporting the introduction of hydrogen, ammonia, and synthetic methane with financial
incentives and regulation;
o  Enhancing nation’s energy self-sufficiency by expanding domestic renewable deployment
and bolstering industrial competitiveness;
o  Integrating renewables into the power market through grid upgrades, balancing
mechanisms, and long-term reliability measures to reduce costs;
o  Coordinating Japan’s efforts with those in the Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) to

back electrification and fuel switching in SE Asia.
•  Japan’s development of advanced semiconductors, photonics, and AI-driven data center
optimization will drive power demand. Energy efficiency is crucial.
•  High-energy industries will need to adopt new and different manufacturing processes to remain
competitive, while Japan remains a leader in global decarbonization.



State-aligned think tank outlines limits to boosting U.S. share of Japan’s LNG imports
(Denki Shimbun, Feb 17)
•  Japan should expand LNG imports from the U.S., but America’s share cannot be as large as that of
Tokyo’s biggest supplier, Australia, said Yanagisawa Takafumi, a senior researcher at the Institute of
Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ).
•  Australia accounts for about 40% of Japan’s LNG imports. The problem with the U.S. is that
obtaining cargo from that country takes longer (30 days via the Panama Canal and 40 days around
the Cape of Good Hope), and there are logistical bottlenecks. So, boosting the U.S. share to 40%
would not be good for Japan’s energy security.
•  Yanagisawa also cast doubt about the commercial viability of the Alaska LNG project touted by
Trump as a joint investment opportunity. That project’s economics will depend on state support.
•  CONTEXT: Japan has a significant number of long-term LNG contracts up for renewal this decade,
including with Russia’s Sakhalin II gas project.



NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


GE-led consortium joins bid for Japan’s largest transmission project
(Nikkei, February 20, 2025)
•  GE Vernova will join a consortium bidding to build and operate a ¥1.5-1.8 trillion transmission line
linking Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan’s largest transmission project.
•  CONTEXT: The project will have a 2 GW capacity and involve 800 km of subsea cables, connecting
renewable energy facilities in the north with the Tokyo region, the top power demand center in the
country.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The consortium, including U.S. investment firm Stonepeak, seeks to secure Japan’s transmission
license via a special-purpose company (SPC). It is inviting Japanese firms to invest also, with GE
Vernova hoping to offer its high-voltage equipment.
•  OCCTO is reviewing bids from both a domestic alliance led by TEPCO and the foreign group,
marking the first time foreign firms have bid for a cross-regional transmission project in Japan.
•  The route faces high costs and technical challenges. The domestic group hopes to get government
support to ensure financial viability, while the GE Vernova group wants state assistance in terms of
approvals and help with local stakeholder negotiations.
• TAKEAWAY: Power infrastructure investment has long been the domain of domestic companies and the entry of
GE into the bidding is a shock. Japanese firms will seek to play up the national security factor, but politically
this may be the best time for U.S. firms to strike a deal in Japan. The GE-led group is also helped by the fact
that the TEPCO-led group seems to be demanding more state financial support.



Energy agency advances study on simultaneous market

(Denki Shimbun, Feb 20)
•  ANRE and OCCTO resumed discussions at the council of advisers around the creation of a
"simultaneous market," refining details on pricing mechanisms and schedule of introduction.
•  CONTEXT: The market is also referred to as the “synchronized reserve” market. It aims to combine the
functions of JEPX spot, JEPX intraday and EPRX (Electric Power Reserve Exchange) balancing
marketplaces. METI believes that merging the trading of kWh and kW would be more efficient than the
current setup.
•  Key topics discussed by officials included whether self-dispatching power generators must
participate, the uplift cost calculations, and how to integrate balancing power systems into intraday
trading.
•  CONTEXT: ‘Uplift costs’ refer to the process of determining additional payments to power generators
beyond what can be covered with the market price. This includes expenses incurred to turn on the plant,
what it costs to operate at minimum capacity, and marginal cost curves.
•  Authorities are determined to provide industry with a market roadmap and define operational
responsibilities, though a concrete launch schedule remains undecided.
• TAKEAWAY: The Three-Part Offer system that would combine output, capacity availability and balancing in one
– which is similar to the U.S. PJM nodal pricing approach – has been under discussion at METI for over two
years. It seeks to ensure that generators can remain in business even though power prices do not cover fixed
costs. That’s important for grid security because a certain amount of capacity has to be kept in reserve and
available during peak demand. Officials and experts have used the last two years to review the market reforms
to date and take stock of shortfalls. With the talks finally moving towards implementation, we expect the
process to accelerate this year.



EEX boosts margin credit for gas futures trading; options contract volumes rise

(Company statement, Feb 18)
•  The EEX started offering enhanced margin credits of up to 70% for trading related to dollar-based
Platts JKM & $TTF futures against a range of European gas and electricity futures contracts.
•  The exchange is also working to set up a similar offset mechanism for Japanese electricity futures.
•  The power and commodities exchange said that in the first week since rolling out its options
contracts for the Japan market, a large-lot transaction for 150 MW was concluded in the Kansai
area, to add to a 50 MW transaction in the Tokyo area.

(Company statement, Feb 18)
o  ShinMaywa, in collaboration with High Pressure Gas and H2 & DX Social Research
Institute, was selected by the Tokyo Metropolitan Govt to develop and demonstrate a
general-purpose hydrogen utilization technology.
o  The initiative focuses on creating a small hydrogen supply unit that extracts hydrogen from
Methylcyclohexane (MCH), a liquid hydrogen carrier that allows for safer and efficient
transportation and storage at room temperature.
o  The project will run until March 2027 and will verify the feasibility of transporting and
using MCH-derived hydrogen in urban areas.
• TAKEAWAY: MCH was seen as losing out to the more prevalent hydrogen carriers such as ammonia and liquid
hydrogen. This project indicates that supporters of the MCH approach have not given up making it part of the
hydrogen society.

Researchers develop ammonia synthesis catalyst using silicon oxides
(Institute statement, Feb 17)
•  Researchers at Tokyo Science University developed an ammonia synthesis catalyst using barium
silicate (Ba₃SiO₅) with hydride (H⁻) and nitride (N³⁻) ions, achieving high catalytic performance
without the need for transition metals like ruthenium.
•  The catalyst enables efficient nitrogen activation through anion vacancy defects, allowing ammonia
to be produced at 300°C, much lower than the conventional Haber-Bosch process that operates at
400-500°C and 10-30 MPa.
•  The catalyst showed stable ammonia production for over 100 hours, with an ammonia synthesis
rate 10 times higher than traditional Ru/MgO catalysts; when combined with ruthenium
nanoparticles, production increased 20-fold.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan’s institutes have announced several significant breakthroughs in the ammonia and hydrogen
space over the past six months or so. That is partly due to the emphasis placed on the sector by the government

since the late 2010s, but even more so since the creation of the Green Innovation Fund. Realistically, it will be
another five years or more before these innovations filter into commercial production. However, these
developments indicate that hydrogen / ammonia supply chains may not need to be as unwieldy as they are
today, which should lead to lower costs.

NEWS:    WIND    POWER      AND   OTHER     RENEWABLES


Offshore wind must look beyond tariffs as costs rise; time to cut capex: McKinsey

(Japan NRG, Feb 18)
•  Reliance on tariffs only to finance offshore wind projects is no longer tenable for the sector, said
Alexander Weiss, global head of electric power and natural gas practice at McKinsey, at the Asia
Offshore Wind Day conference in Tokyo.
•  Last year, the YoY cost of operations at wind power projects grew for the first time in a long time.
The industry now needs to focus on capex reductions to attain better capex efficiency, and cut other
costs to improve project profitability.
•  “The offshore wind industry is still a bit like the startup sector. Capex and opex discipline needs to
improve,” Weiss said. A McKinsey survey of global industry players shows that most firms are now
adjusting their organization size and enforcing firmer financial discipline as inflation keeps rising
across a number of regions.
•  Only six countries currently have more than 500 MW of offshore wind power installed, but another
eight are “committed” and a further 10 could be counted as “upcoming” markets.
•  CONTEXT: Global installed offshore wind capacity was 67.4 GW in 2023, according to the World
Forum Offshore Wind, but that could grow to over 400 GW by 2030 under a bullish scenario, according
to McKinsey. Rystad Energy sees the sector requiring another five years to ramp up to 400 GW.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Trump’s orders unlikely to hurt onshore wind, but U.S. offshore hurting: BNEF
(Japan NRG, Feb 18)
o  President Trump’s orders to stop federal land leases for wind power generation is unlikely
to affect the country’s onshore sector since most is on private land, said David Kang, head
of research for Japan and Korea at Bloomberg NEF.
o  “Impact will be limited” for onshore projects, but offshore wind development will likely
stall, Kang said at Asia Offshore Wind Day. Under Biden, the U.S. issued permits for 18 GW
of offshore wind developments, which should still be able to proceed, Kang said.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

o  New-build financing of offshore wind farms outside China is forecast to rebound to 12.9
GW this year, compared to just 6 GW last year, Kang said. Stabilization in turbine pricing
and other costs will help.
o  CONTEXT: Global investment in the wind power industry was about $195 billion in 2024,
lagging solar’s $521 billion, said BNEF. China accounts for almost two-thirds of the new wind
capacity rollout.

Is It a Ship, or Real Estate? No – It’s a Floating Wind Turbine

While Japan’s government is betting on floating wind power to be a key driver in
renewables expansion in order to achieve 2040 emissions and clean energy targets,
industry players are asking for new technical, economic and regulatory frameworks to
invest in the sector.
On February 18, METI announced approval of the recently drafted Basic Energy Plan
proposal, stating the goal of 40-50% renewable energy of the national energy mix by
2040, with wind power, both onshore and offshore, expected to account for up to 8%.
While this is a small portion, it requires dozens of GW of new capacity. Japan has less
than 6 GW of wind power installed today with offshore wind a tiny fraction of that.

Industry insiders expect floating wind projects to be included in annual auction rounds
within three years.

Recent events at home and abroad are clouding the outlook for the offshore wind sector
with most consultancies revising down their forecasts for capacity rollouts during this
decade. And while companies look to the next phase of offshore wind’s development –
through floating turbines – many are still struggling with the costs of the current phase.
Earlier this month, a Mitsubishi Corp-led consortium claimed it cannot cover project
costs for its fixed-bottom projects in Japan without further state financial assistance. If
these projects stall, it could create a domino effect, delaying others scheduled for
commercialization in the late 2020s.
On that same day when METI made its announcement, developers and industry
stakeholders gathered in Tokyo for the 14th Asia Offshore Wind conference to discuss
the sector’s issues. The talks continued into Smart Energy Week and adjacent events in
Tokyo. Japan NRG reports on the latest mood and discussion points.

What is a floater?
The first major question that officials must grapple with is whether floating wind
turbines qualify as "vessels" under maritime laws. Japan has two conflicting maritime
laws in this regard. According to the Ship Safety Act, floating wind turbines are
considered vessels. However, under the Vessels Act, offshore wind power plants are not
subject to registration, which distinguishes them from standard vessels.
While the Vessels Act does not clearly define "vessels," they are generally understood to
possess buoyancy, loading capability, and mobility. Since floating wind turbines are
moored to the ocean floor and lack mobility, they do not fall under this definition.

Expanding floating wind technology also means extending into the Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ). Maritime traffic in Japan is governed by three key laws: the Act on
Preventing Collisions at Sea, the Maritime Traffic Safety Act, and the Act on Port
Regulations.
These, however, do not apply to the EEZ, where only exploration and development
activities are covered by domestic law. As offshore wind farms could affect vessel
movement and radar systems, METI is working on regulations to address local and
regional challenges.

Floating demos
Earlier this month, METI announced that Round 2 of public bidding for floating
offshore wind demonstration projects will launch by the end of the year, funded by the
Green Innovation Fund. Candidate areas include Offshore Iwau-Minami Shiribeshi and
Offshore Shimamaki in Hokkaido.
At the 14th Asia Offshore Wind Day, industry experts emphasized the importance of
small-scale pilot projects to mitigate technical risks before full-scale deployment.
However, progress has been slow. Round 1 bidding results were only announced in
2024, with SSE Pacifico among the winners, securing funding for a 30 MW project.

To accelerate sector growth, Japan must scale up projects and designate more
demonstration areas. Toward that goal, Hokkaido and Sapporo City are urging the
central government to expand demo sites in Hokkaido's offshore waters.

Why Japan needs floating tech
Due to limited shallow waters, and the rising costs of fixed-bottom offshore wind, Japan
has no choice but to prioritize floating wind. However, developers want a solid
regulatory framework before concrete development plans can be made. Cost, however,
remains the big unknown, as the full operational expense still hasn’t been determined
for each unit, as well as on a major scale.
Japan is not alone in this challenge, given the novelty of the technology worldwide.
However, in the eyes of many market players, it lags behind regional competitors like
Taiwan and South Korea. Developers feel the Japanese government needs to provide
more adequate support to give confidence to the burgeoning sector.

During the February 18 event, a Japanese wind power developer said that firms
planning offshore projects often face difficulties negotiating with fisheries unions, as
fishermen assume ultimate control over the seas.
He argued that these negotiations should be led by the state rather than left to
individual companies. One international firm agreed, saying, "It’s unrealistic for
developers to manage all the stakeholders."

Challenges in floating tech
Global inflation, yen depreciation, and geopolitical conflicts have significantly increased
offshore wind costs, including floating technology. Turbine manufacturers are hesitant
to design new models specifically for floating wind farms, because they remain
uncertain about market demand.

As such, manufacturers say they will likely offer very similar turbines to fixed-bottom
units for the floating sector for this moment. Until a strong project pipeline and firm
orders emerge, manufacturers have little incentive to develop new designs and are still
waiting for strong volumes of firm orders for Asia-Pacific fixed-bottom turbines.
Offshore wind component prices remain about 25% higher than pre-Covid levels,
though inflationary pressures have stabilized, according to Rystad Energy. While
governments in Europe are adjusting to rising costs by increasing subsidies, Japanese
developers argue that Japan's policies are failing to keep pace.

Additionally, Japan's port infrastructure is unprepared for floating wind deployment.
The U.K., for instance, has already developed a port infrastructure roadmap to support
its 5 GW floating offshore wind goal by 2030. Japan, by contrast, lacks a sufficient
number of ports made available to the industry to handle floating foundations and
turbine installation.

Last year, MLIT convened a forum to address these challenges, emphasizing the need
for port facilities capable of managing floating wind projects. MLIT anticipates planning
to only be completed by 2031, with offshore construction beginning five years after area
designation, and then operations starting seven years later; which brings us to almost
the mid 2040s.
Auction scheme needs overhaul
Perhaps the biggest stumbling block for progress in floating offshore wind, however, is
the lack of a clear and profitable business model.

While a flat tariff system like the FIT would be ideal, a Japanese developer said that this
option seems unlikely by the time floating projects are included in tenders. An industry
equipment supplier said they expect floating wind projects to appear only in Round 5 or
6 of the offshore wind tenders.

Meanwhile, asking developers to secure long-term offtake such as through Power
Purchase Agreements (PPAs) is impossible because of the costs that initial floating wind
projects will command.
The difference between the “zero premium” bid prices offered in recent fixed-bottom
auctions, and the prices that would be required to cover expected floating project costs,
is a factor of four. Today’s PPA deal prices, which rarely exceed mid-¥20s per kWh, fall
short of what the developer side needs.

Some European companies advocate for a two-sided Contract for Difference (CfD)
model, which protects both buyers and sellers from price volatility. Another potential
solution for the Japanese market is raising the auction ceiling price and indexing the
bids to the FIP scheme.
There is also the option of introducing a ‘shared cost’ approach, though some
developers say that this would require multiple stages of checks to split the long
development lead times.

Either way, developers want METI to offer a new framework to give industry a sense of
how the floating wind opportunities will potentially unfold.

Spanner in the works
Resolving the issues with the bottom-fixed auction system remains the government’s
problem. Earlier this month, Mitsubishi Corp and its partner Chubu Electric publicly
announced the possibility of withdrawing from the offshore wind sector altogether,
despite winning all three bottom-fixed wind power auctions in Round 1. The developers
say the cost increases incurred since they won the bids in 2021 make the projects no
longer economically feasible.
METI’s initial push in offshore wind focused on cost, and that has translated in recent
rounds all diverging to “zero premium” bids, which in effect mean accepting a ¥14/
kWh price. That level is at odds with the cost of development and can only be covered
through PPA deals and other arrangements.

At least one overseas developer cited cost pressures and uncertainty as reasons for
opting out of the Round 3 auction in 2024.

Fixing the bottom-fixed auction process may be more urgent for METI than attempting
to lay out a new framework for the floating tech. Developers say the ministry is
responding and aware of the issues, but their recent proposals to update the conditions
17

from the next, 4th, auction round do not address the issues facing winners of the first
three rounds.

"The current auction system inevitably leads to 'zero premium' bids," a developer said.
"The bid weighting needs adjustment to ease this pressure and allow realistic pricing."
Another industry member remarked: "There’s been a lag in policy action, but it's finally
starting to move."

Where is Japan's floating wind sector headed?
With so many issues to solve in the bottom-fixed space, is there any urgency to creating
a new framework for floating wind? Many wind power companies say: yes, there is.

While installing floating wind on a large scale is at least 15 years away, developers with
interest in the Japanese market are planning well ahead and want to see a clear
roadmap for the sector. If not, Japan risks developers leaving the market to work on
projects in Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere during “gap years” when no new
capacity is auctioned or progress is slow. That, in turn, leads to shortages of specialist
equipment, talent, or budgets to realise large-scale energy infrastructure development,
affecting METI sector capacity targets and therefore the overall energy sector plans and
emissions targets.
Developers want to see more momentum in the Japanese market, according to an
industry consultant. While many of the challenges in the market today are local, the
supply chain is very much global and Japanese wind projects will need to fit with
international trends to succeed.

Why is Ammonia Used as Next-gen Fuel?
In just over a month, applications for Japan’s first large-scale hydrogen subsidy scheme
are due to close. The ¥3 trillion of subsidies are expected to support a number of sectors
that seek to switch from burning fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, with potential end-
users including steel and glass makers, chemical and oil refinery firms, as well as
transport companies.

The most prominent sector in line for initial state support, however, is power
generation. Japan still relies on coal and natural gas burning for over two-thirds of its
electricity generation, and the prospects of renewables completely taking over in the 15
years are slim, according to the government’s own estimates.
This puts ammonia in line for special attention. Ammonia can be used as a hydrogen
carrier because it contains hydrogen (about 18% by mass). Like hydrogen, it burns
without emitting CO2, but unlike its cousin ammonia benefits from an existing global
supply chain, as it has long been produced and transported for use as fertilizer. This
established infrastructure makes ammonia a relatively cost-effective option for scaling
up as a fuel.

Arguably Japan's biggest backer of ammonia as a decarbonization tool is the country’s
top thermal power utility, JERA, which ran the first commercial-scale test of co-firing
ammonia and coal in a major power station. The 80% (coal) - 20% (ammonia) test was
successfully completed last year; a full-time shift to this ratio at JERA’s Hekinan station
is due in 2027. A year later, testing of 50-50 co-firing at the same plant is expected to
start.
Still, the burning of ammonia to generate electricity is not only a recent phenomenon.
Japan and other countries have researched the topic for decades. Japan NRG looks at
the history of this technology.

Resurgence of interest in ammonia combustion
Research on ammonia as a fuel dates back to the early 20th century. The U.S. explored
its use in gas turbines in the 1960s, but low combustion efficiency led to its
abandonment in favor of cheaper and more efficient fossil fuels. Ammonia was
relegated to discussions on nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation rather than as a viable
energy source.
Interest in ammonia was rekindled in the late 1990s, as concerns over global warming
intensified. In the 2000s, the concept of a "hydrogen society" emerged, positioning
ammonia as a viable hydrogen carrier. However, it was Japan's Strategic Innovation
Promotion Program (SIP) that catalyzed a new wave of research. From 2014 to 2018,
SIP’s Energy Carrier project demonstrated ammonia’s feasibility as a direct combustion
fuel in coal-fired boilers and gas turbines. This initiative laid the groundwork for
subsequent developments in ammonia power generation.

Japan’s major ammonia R&D projects
After the SIP program, the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development
Organization (NEDO) launched multiple research efforts under the Green Innovation
(GI) Fund, a ¥2 trillion ($13 billion) initiative to support low-carbon technologies. From
2021 to 2030, these projects aim to advance ammonia supply chains, next-generation

ship development, and industrial decarbonization. (See Tables 2-3 below for further
details on projects).

Companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, IHI, and JERA have made significant
progress in ammonia-based power generation, while research institutions like Tohoku
University, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
(AIST), and the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) are
addressing combustion stability and NOx emissions.
Ammonia liquefies at approximately 9 atmospheres at room temperature and liquefies
at -33°C even under atmospheric pressure. So, it has the same characteristics as LPG,
and can be manufactured, stored and transported using mostly existing infrastructure.
Wider usage of the fuel would, however, require larger equipment to store and
transport ammonia.

Still, ammonia poses several challenges as a fuel. Compared to methane, the primary
component of natural gas, ammonia’s laminar flow combustion rate is roughly 20%,
and its calorific value per unit mass is about half. This makes stable ignition and
efficient combustion challenging, particularly in confined combustion chambers such as
those found in power plants and engines.
Additionally, ammonia contains a significant amount of nitrogen, which makes NOx
emissions a concern. To mitigate these emissions, researchers are exploring ammonia
combustion chemistry and developing equipment-specific NOx reduction strategies.

Unlike conventional fossil fuels, ammonia does not produce CO2 during combustion,
meaning its radiative heat transfer characteristics also require careful consideration in
system design. This can impact turbine and boiler performance, requiring modifications
to existing systems.
Future prospects for ammonia-based power generation
A number of Japanese firms have tested ammonia co-firing at a pilot or commercial
level in coal power plants. A few including JERA and Kansai Electric have also tried
burning hydrogen in gas power plants.

To allow the end-users to keep their options open, Japan’s three heavy machinery firms
– Mitsubishi Heavy, Kawasaki Heavy, and IHI – are working on different technologies
across the hydrogen and ammonia space. For example, IHI in partnership with GE
Vernova is focusing on ammonia-based solutions and smaller to mid-sized units, while
Kawasaki Heavy Industries prioritizes hydrogen.

Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Heavy is squarely aimed at the market for large turbine units but
hedges its bets on the fuel by testing both ammonia and hydrogen, as well as several
electrolyzer technologies including SOEC.
With the eventual balance between hydrogen and ammonia dependent on cost, supply
chain development, and regional energy policies, all options remain on the table.

The cost of switching to ammonia and hydrogen are often cited as a reason against
pursuing the technology, but there are other criticisms. After all, while co-firing reduces
CO2 emissions, it does not eliminate them entirely because fossil fuels are also used.
Until power plants switch to 100% ammonia or hydrogen fuel, emissions will remain an
issue. Equipment that would allow for the sole firing of ammonia or hydrogen at GW-
scale is not expected to be developed until the end of this decade.

Until the technology is available and tested, ammonia’s role may be seen as a tandem
partner for coal. In fact, environmental groups say that ammonia co-firing will
intentionally or otherwise prolong the life of coal-fired power plants, delaying their
phase-out.
The contrary view is that even if utilities had the equipment to deploy 100% ammonia-
firing today, the amount of the fuel produced globally is vastly inferior to demand. The
first step to bridge the gap is to create a bigger market for ammonia / hydrogen. That is
what METI hopes to do through the ¥3 trillion Contract for Difference (CfD) subsidy
program that is due to close its applications on March 31, 2025.
