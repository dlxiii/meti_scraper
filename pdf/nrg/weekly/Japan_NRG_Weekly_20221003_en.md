Kishida to announce electricity subsidy
(Nikkei, Sept. 28)
•  PM Kishida will announce a new subsidy to reduce power bills when he addresses the Diet on Oct
3. While the amount is not yet known, an across-the-board subsidy of 10% would cost the govt
about ¥1.4 trillion annually.
•  With no end in sight for the weak yen or high energy prices, policymakers must debate an exit

strategy that will eventually scrap the subsidy.
•  The govt’s gasoline subsidy, now at ¥35/ liter, will cost ¥3.2 trillion by year’s end.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Kishida plans a new system to ease consumer impacts of power hikes
(Government statement, Sept. 29)
o  PM Kishida plans a new system to protect vulnerable consumers from the impact of

power rate hikes, expected to rise 20-30% next spring.
o  He ordered ministries to come up with a system by the end of October.
• TAKEAWAY: Some METI advisors warn that the government needs to communicate with consumers about the
need to share energy security costs rather than easing the impact of power rate hikes.

Exchange-based carbon credit trades begin with 145 participants
(Japan NRG, Sept. 22)
•  Japan Exchange began carbon offset credit trades that saw 145 GX League companies participate.
The trades will be on a trial basis until January 2023, before moving to a formal launch.

•  In the trial phase, eight J-Credit types, three J-Ver (compliance credits prior to J-Credit), six
regional credits and voluntary credits earned by GX League members will trade, conducted in
Yen/ton of carbon.
•  There will be two sessions: the morning session closes at 11:29 local time, and the afternoon
session closes at 14:29.
•  On Sept 22, the turnover was 627 trades, mostly J-Credit for renewables, closing at ¥3,300/ ton. J-

Credit for energy conservation closed at ¥1,600/ ton. The Sept 26 turnover was 10 trades, and J-
Credit for renewables closed at ¥3,300/ ton.
•  The reference price of voluntary credits was set at ¥1,600/ ton.
• TAKEAWAY: Trades were launched while unresolved issues, such as verifying voluntary credits, remain on the
back burner. The soft launch strengthened the market’s impression that METI is desperate for a number that
could be called a carbon price and is willing to let the details work themselves out later.

• On the day before the soft launch on Sept. 21, the Federation of Thai Industries also launched exchange-
based carbon trades.

Governor looks to introduce new tax on renewables projects in hilly and woody areas
(RIEF, Sept. 29)
•  Local media reports that Miyagi Prefecture Governor Murai Yoshihiro has announced plans to

introduce a tax on the construction of renewable energy facilities such as solar farms that lead to
forest clearing.
•  The governor reasoned that this would encourage solar farm creation on flat land by making forest
clearing, which often occurs in hilly areas, uneconomic. Cutting down trees can increase the risk of
landslides.
•  Miyagi aims to introduce the levy, which will be a non-statutory general tax, after April 2024.
•  CONTEXT: Miyagi would become the first prefecture to introduce such an ordinance, the details of

which have yet to be designed.
• TAKEAWAY: As Japan NRG reported at the start of the year, there are a number of localities seeking to extract
new taxation on solar and other renewable energy projects, citing increased local government resources
required to both service the developments and liaise with the local population. It’s possible that municipalities
are also looking at new ways to raise revenue and solar farms have been one of the few large growth areas in
the last ten years or so.

ASEAN green finance forum has banks set guidelines
(Asia Nikkei, Sept. 27)
•  CONTEXT: On Sept 2, Japan hosted the 2nd Asia Green Growth Partnership Ministerial Meeting
(AGGPM) organized by METI to discuss green transition and financing strategies for Japan and

Southeast Asia.
•  Japan’s top financial group, MUFG, and other Asian lenders agreed to deem projects eligible for
green financing.
•  Other banks include Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, Mizuho Bank, Citibank and Southeast Asian lenders
Bank Mandiri and Maybank.
•  In cases when a country has yet to publish an official decarbonization framework, banks will refer to

the clean technologies set out by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia. These
include gas-fired thermal plants that reuse waste heat and the co-firing of fossil fuels with
hydrogen or ammonia.



MoE to finance biodegradable plastic wrap development

(Government statement, Sept. 26)
•  As part of efforts to promote plastic recycling for carbon neutrality, the MoE will support Konno Ltd
in developing biodegradable plastic wrap with higher biomass content.
•  Konno manufacturers biodegradable wrap spread on farm lands to prevent weeds, conserve soil
moisture and during winter, heat. The ministry will finance up to 50% of expenses required to
increase the share of biomass in the wrap feedstock.
•  The ministry will also support Sekisui Chemical in the reuse of scrapped car window glass, and
Tachiura Fishery Cooperative for recycling PET fishing nets.
•  CONTEXT: Biodegradable plastic wrap accounts for 10-20% of the total used by farms. They cost

more than those made of polyolefin, but users have increased notably in the Kanto region as it
saves labor. Plastic wrap must be removed after each harvest as torn pieces degrade soil quality.
Manufacturer focus has been on developing wrap with multiple uses to increase crop production
amid climate change, rather than as solutions to reduce the carbon footprint.

METI to back gene engineering to develop biotech-based carbon recycling
(Government statement, Sept. 28)
•  METI will back gene engineering technologies to develop carbon recycling processes using
microorganisms. It plans a budget of ¥177 billion over 2022-2030 to fund universities and

businesses to build technology platforms, develop new breeds of microorganisms able to capture
carbon in the air, and establish manufacturing processes for products potentially replacing
plastics.
•  METI aims to shorten development time to 1/10 that of today by using AI and robotics, and hopes
for commercialization of breakthrough biotech products as early as 2035.
•  The biotech-driven carbon recycling market could grow to almost ¥200 billion by 2050, said the

National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.

2040     1.35 billion tons/ year       ¥65.4 trillion/ year
2050     4.21 billion tons/ year       ¥199.4 trillion/ year
Source: AIST

• TAKEAWAY: METI will either need an exit strategy from the Cartagena Protocol, or ways to develop the
biotech sector within its framework. Japan endorses the Cartagena Protocol on biosafety and biodiversity. The
biomass operators under the Feed-in-Tariff system are required to prove they’re not using unauthorized
genetically modified crops.

• Technology advocates claim that microorganism-assisted bio products do not conflict with food supply chains.
But in a bid to protect local biodiversity, Japan has been strictly banning growth of foreign-origin algae. There
may be new conflicts between energy producers and environmental conservationists.




Orix to establish large nationwide EV charging station chain by mid-decade
(Company statement, Sept. 27)
●  The ORIX leasing and financial group invests in Ubiden Inc., operator of charging stations and

hubs under the “WeCharge” brand.
●  ORIX plans to introduce the WeCharge service at its hotels, condominiums, car parks, and
logistics facilities.
●  Eventually, Orix plans to install 50,000 charging stations by 2025 together with Ubiden, which
would make it the country’s largest provider of the service.
●  CONTEXT: Japan plans to have 150,000 charging spots for EVs by 2030.

JFE Steel-led group successfully tests concrete that cuts CO2 emissions
(Kankyo Business, Sept. 26)
•  JFE Steel Corp, in collaboration with Nishimatsu Corp, Tohoku University, and four other

companies, announced success in testing concrete products made from alkaline activated material
(AAM) that can reduce CO2 emissions during production by about 75% compared to conventional
concrete.
•  CONTEXT: AAM is a low-carbon concrete that does not use ordinary cement. AAM has high
viscosity and a tendency to harden easily when mixed, making it difficult to use. However,
researchers led by JFE Steel developed a unique AAM solution that has stable fluidity and
improved resistance to frost damage.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Taiheiyo develops CO2-absorbing cement material
(Company statement, Sept. 20)
o  Taiheiyo Cement developed CARBOFIX(R) Cement, a CO2 absorbing and hardening
cement material. It emits less CO2 during manufacturing and hardens via a chemical
reaction with CO2 to develop additional strength.
o  Carbofix contains an aluminate phase with one of the constituent minerals of Portland

cement (i.e. regular cement).
o  The new material has a lower calcium oxide (CaO) content and the clinker is calcined at
lower temperatures, cutting CO2 emissions during manufacturing.

Sumitomo Mitsui Trust says Japan puts too much faith into ammonia
(Denki Shimbun, Sept. 28)
•  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank issued a report to warn the government and businesses not to depend
too strongly on ammonia-firing technology. Japan is the main proponent of this approach among

the G7 countries.
•  Global production of ammonia in 2020 was around 185 million tons; half of it in Asia. Now, 80% of
ammonia is used for fertilizer, and the rest is for medicine and refrigeration. Almost none was used
for power generation.
•  For Japan to consider ammonia as a major power source, it needs to tackle great challenges such
as securing supply chains and reducing the cost.




Denso unveils CO2 recycling system
(Monoist, Sept. 20)
•  Denso unveiled a system that captures and purifies CO2 given off by an aluminum melting furnace.
•  The system combines the CO2 with hydrogen to produce methane, then reuse it.
•  While the system only recovers 8 metric tons of CO2 per year, Daiso plans to install more small-

capacity recovery units across other operations.



Tohoku Electric in CO2 capture study
(Nikkei, Sept. 26)
•  Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, Tohoku Electric, and the Nomura Research Institute began a feasibility
study for CO2 recovery at thermal power stations in Niigata.
•  It will study the cost of capturing CO2 and transporting it to the Higashi-Niigata oil and gas well for

storage.
•  CONTEXT: The project is funded by JOGMEC, which aims to build a chain of capture, store and
supply CO2 at East Niigata Port.



Toshiba joins with Accenture for GX consulting

(Denki Shimbun, Sept. 28)
•  Toshiba will work with Accenture to build a comprehensive GX consulting business to help clients
with carbon neutral goals. Their new service will include target setting, building roadmaps,

Two coastal areas added as potential offshore wind development zones
(Government statement, Sept. 30)
•  The coast of Kujukuri in Chiba Prefecture was added to the list of promising offshore wind
promotion zones, which is a rank below promotion zones.
•  The east coast of Toyama prefecture was added to preparatory zones.
• TAKEAWAY: With the public tender process under reconfiguration and new auctions on hold until the new

rules are set, the government is seeking to at least breathe some life into the sector by including more zones
as eligible for development in the future.



Mitsubishi gives details on Akita offshore wind project schedule
(New Energy Business News, Sept. 29)

TEPCO calls on commercial subscribers to further reduce demand
(Nikkei, Sept. 28)
•  TEPCO Holdings increased the demand reduction ceiling it will request from commercial
subscribers at times of peak demand to over 500 MW.

•  METI projects TEPCO network’s January capacity will exceed demand by 4.1%, but a cold snap
could make supply tighter.



Could TEPCO’s retail arm be on the chopping block?

(Diamond, Oct. 1)
•  By end of March, TEPCO’s retail arm TEPCO Energy Partner had a negative net worth; liabilities
exceeded assets by ¥6.7 billion.
•  Thanks to aggressive marketing in recent years, the energy company is Japan’s largest electricity
retailer in terms of kWh sold, which now works against the company as it can’t pass on increased
fuel costs to subscribers. Energy Partner avoided insolvency thanks to a ¥200 billion bailout from
its parent TEPCO Holdings.
•  ENEOS Holdings, Tokyo Gas, NTT, and Chubu Electric are among the companies rumored to be

interested in buying Energy Partner.



MHI to Develop Underground Nuclear Power Plant in the mid 2030s
(Nikkei, Sept 29)
•  By the mid 2030s, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries plans to develop a nuclear power plant “SRZ-1200”
installed underground.
•  The project will be in partnership with Kansai, Hokkaido, Shikoku and Kyushu EPCOs. Those four

power companies operate the PWR type nuclear reactors supplied by MHI.
•  Located underground, the “Innovative Light Water Reactor” would be more resilient to
earthquakes, other natural disasters and terror attacks.
•  The reactor containment vessel will be 100 times safer than conventional reactors, by fortifying the
outer wall. The power supply for the cooling system would also be underground.
•  Output will be about 1,200 MW. While conventional nuclear power plants are mostly operated at a

steady output in Japan, this new reactor would be able to change output four times faster.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
GE and Hitachi to develop new nuclear reactors
(Asia Nikkei, Sept. 30)
o  Hitachi GE Nuclear Energy, a joint venture between Hitachi and General Electric (GE), will
develop a new type of nuclear reactor called the "Innovative Light Water Reactor" with

high safety standards.
o  The new design will be based on the AWR technology that was also used at the
Fukushima station, but will incorporate new features that the prevent problems that
occurred during the 2011 accident.
o  Commercialization is targeted for the mid-2030s. Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy seeks to
offer new units to plants that use boiling-water reactors.

| offer new units to plants that use boiling-water reactors. |

• TAKEAWAY: Japan tends to be overconfident in domestic technology, which puts a question mark over some
of the roadmap dates being proposed. There are also a high number of new designs now under proposal. Not
all of them will be able to go ahead, so there will be a degree of competition between vendors.

LDP Diet members visit Mihama and Tsuruga NPPs
(Denki Shimbun, Sept. 26)
•  10 Diet members from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party that are part of a parliamentary group
that promotes the replacement of older reactors with new technology, visited the Mihama (Kansai
Electric) and Tsuruga (Japan Atomic) nuclear power plants on Sept 21 and 22.
•  The group, established in April 2021, plans to make recommendations to the govt. by the end of

2022. However, the group’s chair, Inada Tomomi, has yet to name the sites where new nuclear
construction should take place.
•  Inada also stressed that the group plans to ask the govt to clarify its position on replacement and
new reactor construction. The group will also soon visit the Sendai NPP (Kyushu Electric).
• TAKEAWAY: Public sentiment towards nuclear power is warming. A recent Nikkei poll of 100 presidents of
major companies in Japan revealed that 60% believe new nuclear units should be built with over 70% of the
respondents claiming that power constraints were having an impact on their business.

• The question is, then, where would any new reactors be built in Japan? The similarities between older
technology and new developments touted by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries suggest new units could be added
at the Mihama NPP.

• Tsuruga may also be an option. In March 2004, Japan Atomic applied to the industry regulator to build 1,538
MW of capacity at Units 3 and 4 of Tsuruga NPP. The plan was to install Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor
(APWR) technology supplied by MHI. Site renovation work in preparation for the new build was completed in
2009, but the regulator’s review stopped in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.

Petronas signs MoC on energy transition with METI, JBIC
(Government statement, Sept. 26)
o  CONTEXT: METI’s near-term interest is to secure LNG supplies, and in the longer term
hydrogen, while Petronas is possibly exploring the potential of LNG-hydrogen
combustion. Petronas signed a separate but a similar agreement with the Japan Bank of

International Cooperation on Sept 27 and with JERA last year.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan floated the idea of regional LNG hubs throughout Asia a couple of years ago and started
to sign intergovernmental agreements around this framework. However, the initiative has clearly gained more
momentum this year after international energy supplies were disruption by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the
sanctions that came after it. How well this can work in practice for the LNG sector has yet to be tested.

Coal, Gas, EVs and Net-Zero:
Japan Updates Energy Ties with Indonesia

One of Japan’s closest economic partners, especially in the energy sector, is
Indonesia. The resource-rich, emerging Southeast Asian economy has long been a key
supplier of coal and gas. Now these ties are being upgraded for the era of net-zero.

Next month, Indonesia will become the first nation alongside Japan to endorse the
Asian Zero Emissions Community initiative. Jakarta will be given the rank of co-
initiator, with the move due to be announced at the G20 to take place in Bali.

In terms of policy, this supports Japan’s ambition to corral an Asia-led energy
transition that fine-tunes decarbonization roadmaps based on local conditions.
Indonesia’s onboarding will also show the willingness of one of Asia’s biggest coal
users to start working on a structured, concrete framework for a shift to a clean
economy.

For businesses, the step is even more significant. Japanese firms have a history of
fossil fuel investments in Indonesia. Jakarta's broad alignment with Tokyo on
decarbonization will help Japanese firms share their cleantech while also achieving a
larger market scale.


Political drivers
Indonesia is Japan’s No. 2 coal supplier after Australia and among the major sellers of
natural gas. It even delivers a significant volume of crude oil to Japan.

Should Japan succeed in its planned reduction of fossil fuel consumption, trade
revenues would drop in kind. Yet, Tokyo seeks to establish the next set of energy ties
with Jakarta, extending an invitation to become a co-initiator of the Asian Zero
Emissions Community that collates the development of zero-emission technologies
and their standardization, the creation of carbon credit markets, and of clean financing
options.

While a focus on Asia as a whole has always been a part of Japan’s decarbonization
strategy, the Community concept was announced by Prime Minister Kishida and fits
with this greater emphasis on regional frameworks for trade, security, and rule of law.

Interestingly, when Kishida established the GX Council in July as the HQ for the
government’s decarbonization efforts, he named a leading Indonesian expert among
the Council’s 13 members.

Such moves suggest Japan sees great potential in Indonesia, whose goal is to be
among the world's top five economies by 2045. Indonesia is the most coal-reliant
nation in Southeast Asia, but shares Japan’s interest in moving thermal power
generation to biomass and ammonia, at least partially.
“Japan has the technology and Indonesia has the natural resources,” an Indonesian
official told Japan NRG.

19


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

Questions around “zero”
Indonesia is clearly high on Kishida's Asia-focused decarbonization initiative. Takashi
Shiraishi, Chancellor of Kumamoto Prefectural University, is one of the GX Council's
inaugural members and an Indonesia expert.

Still, merging Indonesia and Japan interests won’t be easy given their different
economic cycles. Indonesia has the world’s fourth-largest population and is not
entirely comfortable with the “zero emission” wording that Kishida proposed.

Indonesia is not ready for such a drastic transition and also questions the vision’s
viability since the Community initiative excludes China, the world’s largest emitter.
Jakarta only last summer pledged to aim for carbon neutrality and set its deadline as
2060, a decade after Japan’s target, which is now enshrined in law.

The two countries have yet to hammer out an actual bilateral cooperation agreement
to fit the Community aims. Still, should these challenges be overcome, Japan hopes
to invite more ASEAN members into the Community ahead of the G7 next year.

While the political dialogue is ongoing, in March firms led by JERA and TEPCO
drafted a future electricity roadmap for Indonesia. In the context of energy security
and balance, the roadmap advises focusing on three energy sources – ammonia,
hydrogen and LNG (with carbon capture) – as the main fuels.

These suggestions are moving into practice. Mitsubishi Heavy earlier this year
announced that it would conduct feasibility studies on ammonia co-firing at the
Suralaya thermal power plant (coal) and look at pairing the clean-burning fuel with
natural gas.

In a related development, Mitsubishi Corp signed an MoU with Pertamina, Indonesia's
state oil company, and Pupuk Indonesia, a state-owned fertilizer firm, to establish a
green hydrogen and ammonia value chain and jointly develop CCUS businesses.

Marubeni Corp and Chiyoda Corp have also signed MOUs with Pertamina around
joint development of decarbonization projects. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Power is
working with Indonesia's state-owned PT PLN and Bandung Institute of Technology,
the top engineering school, to compile policy proposals for biomass co-firing.


Business projects forging ahead
Indonesia also has targets in the renewable energy sector – to reach 23% of the power
mix in 2025, compared with around 11% in 2020.

Indonesia has traditionally focused on biomass and geothermal as two main
renewables, but the archipelagic country is now shifting to solar power as a new
growth sector. Here too, Japanese firms are involved. For instance, in September
2021, Alamport and NiX Co. began developing factory-roof PV generation under a
third-party ownership model (PPA).

Tie-ups in geothermal power have also progressed: INPEX invested in a project in
West Sumatra in December 2021. In the same month, Marubeni and Tohoku Electric
began commercial operation at the Rantau Dedap Geothermal Power Project in South


20

Sumatra.

Kansai Electric started a renewable energy certificate project in Indonesia based on
power generated at its Rajamandala Hydroelectric Power Plant in West Java. The
utility agreed to sell the renewable energy value of the electricity (i.e., the green
certificates) to three Indonesian entities belonging to Japanese auto-parts maker
Aisin.

For automakers, Indonesia is an important market. As well as its large population, the
country has vast reserves of cobalt and nickel, and seeks to become a manufacturing
and exporting hub for EVs. Indonesia aims to start full-scale EV manufacturing this
year when it hosts the G20, and then for 20% of domestic car production to be EVs by
2025.

Japanese auto firms have long enjoyed a market share of more than 90% in Indonesia,
but the arrival of the EV era is changing the playing field dramatically. South Korea's
Hyundai began EV production in Indonesia this spring, ahead of Japanese rivals, while
LG Energy Solution is building a local battery factory. Likewise, China’s battery giant
CATL entered the market and U.S.-based Tesla is also preparing to invest.

Finally, Toyota said in July that it will invest $1.8 billion in EV development in
Indonesia over the next five years as part of efforts to support local green energy
initiatives. In the same month, Mitsubishi Motors announced plans to invest about 10
trillion rupiah ($667 million) in Indonesia between 2022 and 2025 to produce hybrid
and EVs.

Many of the above-mentioned projects are in a nascent stage, but Japanese firms
believe that the size of the Indonesian market will help achieve commercial scale
relatively quickly. Successes can then be translated to other Southeast Asian nations
that are also wrestling with how to handle the energy transition without sacrificing
their economic growth.

Bringing Indonesia in as a major partner in the Asian Zero Emission Community won’t
allow Japanese cleantech to avoid competition in such a major market. But it should
help businesses to upgrade their Southeast Asian strategies to align with the global
net-zero agenda.

As Japan Prepares for More Battery Power Trading,
Hokkaido Is a Hotspot

Japan's power market will get a boost from a recent law change that elevates the
status of storage batteries connected to the grid to a power generation business.

This could spur major change to the power system, both in terms of the technical
potential and for business models. More battery installations should allow for a better
balancing of the rising electricity volume from variable energy sources such as solar
and wind. It also should breathe life into several subcategories of the electricity
market, as battery operators seek ways to turn a profit.

The law change has led to a wave of domestic and foreign company interest in battery
projects in Japan. And by far the most popular location so far is Hokkaido, the
country’s northernmost isle.

Hokkaido served as the vanguard of Japan’s renewables revolution a decade ago.
Now the island’s unique geography and role in the national energy system is
providing interesting findings for Japan’s battery pioneers.


The original trailblazer
There’s a spike in the number of grid connection applications by companies planning
storage battery projects in Hokkaido, reported Hokkaido Electric Power Network (the
transmission business unit of Hokkaido Electric) in a recent METI grid task force
meeting. As of the end of July, 61 projects totaling 1.6 GW applied for access to the
Hokkaido grid. That’s nearly half of the island’s demand average of 3.5 GW.

Hokkaido has been a testing ground for storage battery systems in Japan from the
start. Barely a year after the country rolled out its feed-in tariff (FIT) program in 2012
to spur investment in renewables, almost 30% of new solar installations were
concentrated in Hokkaido, one of the few areas of Japan endowed with large open
spaces and flat land.

The surge in renewables projects in Hokkaido led METI to announce special measures
to make sure the jump in the volume of intermittent power output did not overwhelm
the local grid. After all, Hokkaido’s own power demand was often far below its local
production, while the transfer of electricity to other areas was constrained by low
throughput capacity.

So, the ministry in April 2013 implemented a number of steps including a large-scale
storage battery system at a substation and smaller systems at each renewable power
station. METI set aside about ¥30 billion to install a 60 MWh battery system that could
improve Hokkaido’s total short-term balancing ability by 10%.

While the 60-MWh project was under construction, new solar projects of 2MW or
larger were asked to install on-site storage batteries. This requirement was later
expanded to wind power.

22


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

What this looks like in practice can be demonstrated by the solar and battery complex
set up by SB Energy and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease in Hokkaido’s Yakumo Town. The
companies built a 102 MW solar farm in the town and an onsite 27.8 MWh lithium-ion
battery system. The batteries, charged when it is sunny and discharged when cloudy,
help keep the fluctuations of power output within 1% per minute, according to
SBEnergy.

This strategy, however, has proved inefficient. Natural intermittencies mean that one
storage battery working with just one renewables project does little to balance supply
over a whole area. It’s expected that METI will soon drop this requirement.

Now a more promising approach has emerged in the shape of installing batteries on
the grid side, which would inherently service numerous energy generators.


Redox flow batteries
In 2017, Hokkaido Electric Power Network began soliciting applications for a battery
system to be jointly installed by multiple developers of wind projects across the area.

Earlier this year, Sumitomo Electric supplied a 51 MWh redox flow battery system for
the Power Network’s Minami Hayakita substation. The project is already operational
and adds to the 60 MWh pilot project at the same location and by the same supplier
that came online in 2015.

Redox flow batteries have a long service life of 20 years with almost no degradation of
electrodes and electrolytes, and offer a high safety standard as they are made from
non-combustible materials, making them ideal for the grid, according to the company.

The pilot phase tested whether batteries could be employed for frequency regulation,
a role that was traditionally played by thermal and hydropower stations, and found the
results to be positive.


New business models
The rise in interest in battery installations comes thanks to revisions to the Electricity
Business Act passed by parliament in May. These allowed large-scale battery systems
installed on the grid side to qualify as a power generation business. The revision,
which will take effect in April 2023, gives clarity to the status of storage battery
projects in the power market and guarantees their access to the grid.

This is important as batteries are expected to play a bigger role in the capacity
market, the balancing market and the whole power markets. But it will take time for
operators to find the right business model for the power storage facilities.

At present, selling power stored in batteries on the wholesale market is not a viable
business model and once the capacity market is open for battery operators, that could
become a route to profitability, according to some industry watchers. The capacity
market is due to start in 2024.

According to Takuya Ogushi, president of renewables firm Smart Energy, an
investment in storage batteries could be recouped in under three and a half years

23


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

through trading of its power on the balancing market. Ogushi’s calculations, published
in May in Mega Solar Business, assume that the cost of a 1-MWh battery system is
¥150 million. Japan introduced a balancing market in April 2021.

Batteries could become a big business and are already attracting major companies
and investments. Orix and Kansai Electric earlier announced a plan for a 113 MWh
lithium-ion battery system in Wakayama Prefecture.

The project, slated to start in April 2024, is considered one of Japan’s largest for
stand-alone batteries not owned by a transmission operator. Kyushu Electric wants to
start trading battery power from 2023 based on a 4.2 MWh lithium-ion battery system
currently under construction.

Last month, Toho Gas also announced plans to install a 70 MWh sodium-sulphur
(NAS) battery, which will be up and running in 2025.


Solution creates another problem
While more batteries mean better balancing of intermittent energy sources, they are
also starting to aggravate another grid issue. Batteries require transmission capacity to
both send power to the grid and receive it. This is going to strain the Japanese grid
even further and requires new investments in electricity transmission lines and other
infrastructure, METI says.

For now, METI urges firms keen to expand in the battery space to seek out areas with
easy grid access and for utilities to give better information on where such access is
available. Soon, however, the issue of grid upgrades will become even more critical.
How costs will be split among existing and new market participants is yet to be seen.

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Afghanistan/ Fuel deal
The Taliban signed a deal with Russia for the supply of gasoline, diesel, and gas. The
move is the first known major international economic deal struck by the Taliban since
they returned to power more than a year ago.

Brazil/ Oil
London-based Trident Energy seeks a partner to develop the Siri discovery in the
Badejo and Linguado oil fields that are part of the Pampo and Enchova hub acquired
from Petrobras in 2020. Siri is estimated to have 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Germany/ Energy crisis
About 10% of mid-sized companies have cut or halted production because of gas
prices. Some industrial giants in gas-heavy industries are shifting production and
sourcing from elsewhere; others are switching from gas to coal or oil. Also, the
government announced a €200 billion energy aid package including a cap on gas
prices to protect businesses and consumers.

German/ LNG
Germany has managed to fill its gas reserves to 91.32% of capacity, allaying fears it
could run out this winter after Russian gas flows fell sharply following European
sanctions.

Germany/ Nuclear power
The lifespan of two of the country’s last nuclear power plants — Isar 2 and
Neckarwestheim — will be extended beyond their planned phase-out. Berlin had
planned to complete a phase-out of nuclear power by the end of this year but a
collapse in energy supplies from Russia induced the government to keep two plants
on standby until April.

France/ Nuclear power
The government picked Luc Rémont, a senior Schneider Electric executive, to head
EDF as it moves to fully renationalise the nuclear power operator and end reactor
outages straining electricity supplies across Europe. A €9.7 billion tender offer to buy
out minority shareholders could be handed to regulators next week.

India/ Wind power
GE Renewable Energy has orders from Continuum Green Energy Limited to supply,
install and commission 81 units of onshore wind turbines for the 219 MW wind power
projects across Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, India.

Nigeria/ Renewables
Shell made its first renewable power acquisition in Africa with the purchase of Daystar
Power, which operates in Nigeria, Ghana and three other countries across west Africa,
providing solar power and battery solutions to business and industry across the
region.

Philippines/ LNG
Two advanced LNG projects have delayed commercial operations to next year. The
terminals, being built by First Gen and Singapore-headquartered Atlantic Gulf &
Pacific, now aim to begin operations in Q1 2023. However, these problems are
unlikely to be resolved by early 2023. In fact, the supply crunch may not ease until
2026.

Sweden/ Environmental disaster
Europe faces an environmental catastrophe as natural gas leaks out of the damaged
Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in Swedish and Danish waters. A ton of methane has a
climate impact 80 times that of CO2, said David McCabe, a scientist at Clean Air Task
Force. “If pipelines fail, the impact to the climate can be disastrous, even
unprecedented."

United Kingdom/ Nuclear power
French-owned EDF Energy will review whether the closure of two of Britain’s five
remaining nuclear power plants – Hartlepool and Heysham 1 nuclear power plants –
could be postponed beyond 2024. Together, both have a generation capacity of 2.2
GW. Both are currently scheduled to close in March 2024
