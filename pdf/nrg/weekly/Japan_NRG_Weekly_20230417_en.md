G7 Climate and Energy Ministers Meeting in Sapporo: Key Points

(Nikkei, Reuters, Japan NRG, April 16)
•  The G7’s climate and energy ministers met in Sapporo on April 15 and 16.
•  They agreed to accelerate the phase out of all unabated fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas
(i.e., facilities that do not have a way to capture their emissions in some form, such as using CCS).
Gas was added to this list for the first time, which signals its phase out will also now start.
•  The G7 will not seek to stop investment in natural gas production when it is done “in a manner
consistent with our climate objectives and without creating lock-in effects.” The group accepted
that emerging nations may wish to utilize to gas for power generation. However, the G7 stressed

the need to cut overall gas consumption, as well as to cut energy use in general.
•  There was no agreement on a final date by which to phase out coal-fired power generation.
Canada and the UK had hopes to persuade the group to set a target of 2030 for this action.
•  The G7 renewed its commitment to support more renewable energy use, especially in power
generation. The seven nations collectively set the goals of adding 150 GW of offshore wind
capacity and 1 TW of solar capacity by 2030.
•  Nuclear energy retained its support.

•  The G7 statement included a target of a 60% reduction in GHG emissions by 2035, compared to
2019 levels.
•  METI Minister Nishimura said there is interest to finding ways to use finance to cut CO2 in “hard-
to-abate” sectors like chemicals, shipping and steel.
•  The UAE called for a fairer deal for the developing economies, especially via climate finance.
•  The G7 agreed to work on an action plan to secure a stable supply of critical raw materials (CRM)

for clean tech through investment in mining and recycling.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
G7 ministers to agree on method to calculate steel sector’s GHG emissions
(Nikkei, April 14)
o  G7 countries were expected to agree at the Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers'
meeting on a global method to collect data on the steel industry’s GHG emissions.
o  There are five methods for calculating emissions of the steel sector. Differences emerge,

for example, to which extent raw materials are included in the calculation methods.
o  The Japan Iron and Steel Federation uses a calculation method equivalent to ISO 14404,
which permits easy comparison with other developed countries.
o  CONTEXT: According to the MoE, the steel industry is Japan’s largest CO2 emitting
sector, accounting for about 40% of the CO2 emitted in Japan in FY2020.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

UK, Canada ministers say won’t back Japan on ammonia co-firing
(Asia Nikkei, April 14)
o  Canada's Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault, and the
U.K.'s Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Grant Shapps, both said they

do not support Japan’s idea of moving coal power plants to also burn ammonia in a so-
called co-firing strategy.
o  Ammonia does not emit CO2 when burned. However, both ministers said this approach
will allow the use of coal power plants to continue.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Over 300 Japanese organizations and companies send G7 message on renewables
(Coalition statement, April 12)
o  The Japan Climate Initiative (JCI), a coalition of 303 Japanese organizations, called on
the government to accelerate renewable energy and introduce a carbon pricing system.
o  JCI wants regulatory reforms for Japan to achieve a fully or predominantly decarbonized
electricity supply by 2035, in line with G7 goals.
o  JCI’s message was released ahead of the G7 Ministers’ Meeting on Climate, Energy and

Environment, held in Sapporo this weekend.



G7 members discuss joint action plans to stabilize critical minerals supplies
(NHK, Japan NRG, April 15)
•  The G7 members were expected to agree on joint action plans to address the need to stabilize
critical minerals procurement that has seen intense competition with China and other countries.
•  G7 will jointly spend ¥1 trillion to develop new mines and materials recycling.

•  CONTEXT: Critical minerals commonly include lithium, nickel and cobalt, which are used in EV
batteries, for hydrogen storage alloys and synthetic fuel production equipment. Investment in
mining has stagnated over recent years despite greater demand for raw materials, including for the
energy transition.
• TAKEAWAY: It’s too early to say how this commitment will translate into boosting the primary source of new
raw materials (mines), since the sector's problems go far beyond a shortage of finance. However, the G7

agreement to cooperate on recycling could prove to be significant since it seems to address some of the
uncertainties around the movement of the secondary source of raw materials (old equipment).
• As an example, the G7 commitment should help to resolve the years-long debate on whether to classify black

mass – a material containing lithium, cobalt and nickel, and recovered from spent lithium-ion batteries -- as
hazardous waste or scrap metal.
• The present scrap classifications system is broad and includes any material with impurities which cannot be
used for batteries. This is not an effective tool to understand international battery material supply flow. So, if

the G7 agreement adds clarity to classifications, it should help companies build more efficient battery supply
chains.
• Industry stakeholders say a new system of trade codes specifically for recycled battery materials is required.

• What’s less clear is how this G7 policy trend will impact China, whose rare earths and silicon supplies underpin
the global markets for clean tech.

• If the Chinese metals sector becomes more vulnerable to demand uncertainties due to geopolitical de-
coupling trends, it will cause broader concerns in Beijing. China has also traditionally suffered from the
smuggling of mineral resources out of the country.

IEA moves to define clean hydrogen based on emissions intensity not colors
(Nikkei, April 11)
•  The IEA has a new report to help define “clean” hydrogen based on emissions intensity. When the
criteria are met, hydrogen generated from fossil-fuels with CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and

storage) can also be referred to as “clean.”
•  By setting regulations and certification, plans of different hydrogen production routes enable the
industry to move away from the use of terminologies based on colors and will help develop
international hydrogen supply chains.
•  METI plans to revise its hydrogen strategy in May. In the short-term, METI will support “blue
hydrogen” generated from natural gas with a carbon capture process.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Japan Gas Association welcomes IEA’s hydrogen carbon intensity standard proposal
(Japan NRG, April 14)
o  The Japan Gas Association (JGA) welcomes the International Energy Agency (IEA)
proposal to create hydrogen standards based on emission intensity, rather than gas
production routes, often denominated by colors, a JGA official told Japan NRG.
o  The creation of global hydrogen standards should support Japanese gas utilities, which
aim to commercialize new energy sources such as synthetic methane (e-methane) that

require clean hydrogen.
o  CONTEXT: Senior JGA officials met with the environment minister and senior METI
officials ahead of the G7 summits in Sapporo this past weekend to push Japan’s role in
global rulemaking for synthetic fuel consisting of hydrogen and recycled carbon.
• TAKEAWAY: Hydrogen is a clear, transparent gas, but how it is produced differs. The various energy sources
used to make hydrogen have been assigned a color. Brown or grey hydrogen represents traditional hydrogen

from fossil-fuels that emits a lot of CO2 during manufacture. Green hydrogen is generated through electrolysis
using renewable energy. But the definitions of other colors such as blue, yellow, turquoise, pink, etc have no
internationally agreed criteria.



Hokkaido’s renewable resources key to net zero: Renewable Energy Institute forum
(Japan NRG, April 13)
•  Hokkaido has huge renewable potential and is key to Japan’s carbon neutrality goals by 2035.
Japan has 656 GW wind power potential, and 320 GW are in the Hokkaido area.
•  To enable other parts of the country to benefit from this clean energy potential, the govt must
encourage construction of new power lines to connect with Japan’s main island of Honshu and

accelerate decisions on where to set the line routes.
•  People in Hokkaido also need to see that renewable projects are improving their lives.
•  Green energy will attract investments from other industries. Ishikari City has three renewable-
powered data centers and Rapidus plans a chip plant in Chitose City that may be powered with
green electricity.
•  CONTEXT: Hokkaido local govt heads and renewable energy experts discussed the region’s
potentials at a forum organized by REI, ahead of the April 15-16 Sapporo G7 climate summit.

• TAKEAWAY: Staging the G7 meeting in Hokkaido was clearly one way for Japan to signal the clean energy
ambitions of that region. A Japan NRG survey found in the two months running up to the Sapporo meeting, at
least six local municipalities announced plans to be carbon neutral by 2050.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT
City in Hokkaido aims to become major wind power hub
(Japan Times, April 9)
o  Ishikari is attracting renewable energy firms, and METI estimates its potential for
renewable-generated electricity at 3.6 GW; currently 300 MW is installed.
o  Around 10 energy firms are operating or have plans to build onshore or offshore wind

turbines in the area.
o  Obstacles to realizing Hokkaido's renewable energy potential include environmental
concerns, technological and economic considerations, and political acceptance.

The NRA finds errors in Japan Nuclear Fuel application for earthquake equipment

(TBS, April 14)
•  Errors were found in a 3,100-page application submitted by Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited (JNFL) to
the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) in December 2022 for the operation of a spent fuel
reprocessing plant in Rokkasho, Aomori Pref. The NRA has requested that JNFL resubmit the
application.
•  JNFL had already been alerted to numerous errors in the application by the NRA in January 2023.

Upon further investigation, JNFL discovered that about 5% of the 60,000-page application
contained errors such as missing pages, typos or omissions.
•  JNFL president apologized and said he wasn’t aware that the application had been rushed.
•  CONTEXT: JNFL operates the Vitrified Waste Storage Center, Uranium Enrichment Plant, and Low-
Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Center; and is building a spent fuel reprocessing plant and MOX
fuel production facility at Rokkasho.
• TAKEAWAY: JNFL keeps pushing back the start of the reprocessing plant, which is one of the most important

facilities for Japan’s nuclear industry. The original schedule was to complete construction in 1997. The latest
deadline is for the first half of FY2024.

high efficiency process to produce hydrogen and graphite from methane. This is known as
“turquoise” hydrogen.
•  If the project goes forward, the production facility will be in the Chubu region. Annual production
capacity might start at as much as 10,000 tons of hydrogen, and expand to 50,000 to 100,000
tons. Chubu Electric would use the hydrogen as fuel at power plants, as well as for industry and

mobility.
•  A final decision is expected by late 2024.















Idemitsu, H-Cycle to do a study on producing hydrogen from solid waste

(Company statement, April 13)
•  Idemitsu Kosan and U.S.-based H-Cycle will do a study on production of low-emission hydrogen

Long-term decarbonizing power auction to promote modernization of thermal power plants
(Denki Shimbun, April 14)
•  Major power utilities are seizing on METI’s launch of the “Long-Term Decarbonized Capacity
Auction” system as a way to update aging thermal power facilities.
•  CONTEXT: METI announced earlier this month that the auctions for this system will begin in

January 2024. The aim of the auction is to stimulate the construction of clean power generation
facilities. However, due to a perceived shortage of LNG-fired capacity, METI also wants to use the
first three years of the auction system to support the addition of 6 GW of low-carbon generation
fueled by natural gas.
•  Kansai Electric and Kyushu Electric are considering plans to upgrade aged thermal power plants to
combined cycle technology, which may be able to boost their energy efficiency from around 44%
to 63%, while cutting emissions by about 30%.
•  The targets for upgrades are Kansai’s Nanko LNG power Plant (1.8 GW), its oldest gas-fired

station, and Units 3 (600 MW) and 5 (600 MW) at Kyushu’s Shin-Kokura Thermal Power Plant.
• TAKEAWAY: METI is skilled in political rhetoric and maneuvering. Recently, it was able to revive plans to build
new nuclear power stations under the “Green Transformation” agenda. This time, a system ostensibly set up to
support the building of “decarbonized” capacity seems to be deployed also to support new gas-fired facilities.
Officials argue these are pragmatic solutions to short-term issues until more renewables capacity is available.



Power utility body to probe cartel charges, strengthen anti-monopoly compliance

(FEPC statement, April 14)
•  The Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPC) set up a third-party panel consisting of lawyers
to probe allegations that cartel discussions took place during federation meetings.
•  The panel will propose measures to strengthen Antimonopoly Act compliance.
•  CONTEXT: After charging six power companies with cartel practices last month, the Japan Fair
Trade Commission asked the FEPC to improve compliance to competition regulations.


NRA ordered JAPC to reintroduce corrected application of Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 by Sept

(Denki Shimbun, April 13)
•  The NRA told Tsuruga NPP operator, Japan Atomic Power Co. (JAPC), that they should resubmit
the application for the restart of the station’s Unit 2 reactor by Aug. 31.
•  The NRA said this will be the utility’s last chance to gain approval for the facility.
•  The message was delivered directly to the president of JAPC at an emergency meeting on April
11. The regulator gave an administrative direction to the company to resubmit its application with

all relevant data corrected.
•  CONTEXT: The regulator is concerned about an area referred to as the “D-1 Crushed Zone,”
which is where the main components of Unit 2 are situated. It sits just 200 meters away from an

12


CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

active geological fault, known as “Active Fault K”. The utility submitted data to show that the two
are not connected, but since the data was tampered with, the NRA is not confident on this issue.
• TAKEAWAY: If the company cannot convince the NRA that the station is not at risk from an earthquake, then it
must be decommissioned. This will stop JAPC’s plans to add more reactors to the site. This debate has raged
since 2013, when the NRA made its initial conclusion that the location is unsafe based on unofficial meetings

with geologists. Evidence of JAPC tampering with data has already damaged its reputation and will make the
restart of Unit 2, whatever the NRA final decision, extremely difficult.















Chubu Power Grid curtailed renewables operators, company’s first
(Nikkei, Tokyo Shimbun, April 11)
•  On April 7 the grid operator curtailed output from 30-410 MW of capacity for the following day.

For solar sites, the suspension was based on operators with an output of 10 kW or more.
•  Chubu Power Grid said curtailment of renewable energy was for 30 minutes during the day on
April 8 and 9, curbing 4 MW and 590 MW, respectively.
•  The company said these measures were due to factories and other facilities not operating on
holidays, and decreasing demand for electricity when there was low air conditioning use. Also,
solar power generation had increased due to good weather.
•  CONTEXT: This was the first curtailment in one of Japan’s three major metropolitan areas, as well

as a first for Chubu Power Grid. During Chubu’s peak demand, almost half the electricity in the grid
came from renewables.
• TAKEAWAY: In 2018, the Kyushu grid operator started to curtail some power generators due to excess supply
in certain moments. In 2022, grid companies in Hokkaido, Tohoku, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Okinawa did the
same. The Chubu area has only just joined this nationwide trend, but it could see more regular curtailments if
the Hamaoka NPP is allowed to restart, which is unlikely in the near term.

IHI and Sharing Energy to collaborate on creating environmental value from solar
(Company statement, April 13)
•  IHI and Sharing Energy will launch a joint project in April 2023 to create “environmental value” by
installing solar power generation systems in homes, offices, stores, and others.

•  CONTEXT: Environmental value refers to a certified reduction of emissions that can be packaged
into a sellable product, such as a carbon credit. Buyers use such products to cut their own
emissions total.
•  Sharing energy provides a service called "Share-Denki" that allows customers to install solar power
generation systems for free and save on their electricity bills.
•  The project aims to convert the energy from this service into credits through the J-Credit system

using an environmental value management platform developed by IHI.

(Company statement, April 13)
•  Marubeni and Taisei will build and operate a wood-fired biomass power plant with capacity of 9.95
MW, near Ishikari City, Hokkaido.
•  This project will provide power from the region’s unused thinned wood. Marubeni has developed

six biomass-fueled power plants in Japan. This will be the second biomass power plant to involve
domestic consumption of locally produced fuel.



JRC developed access gangway for offshore wind station

(Company statement, April 11)
•  Japan Radio Co. (JRC) developed an offshore access gangway for safe transfer between a crew
transfer vessel (CTV) and an offshore wind farm. JRC plans to launch it in 2024.
•  It’s not easy to move from a CTV to a wind farm platform – the vessel moves up and down and
sideways. The gangway is fit for both small-size and large vessels.
•  JRC knows the water conditions in Japan well and the new gangway mitigates risk of falling in the
water or getting caught between the vessel and platform. The gangway has AIP (approval in
principle) from Bureau Veritas in France.

• TAKEAWAY: Japan plans to build more offshore wind power plants in the next 20 years, and demands for safe
transport from onshore to offshore and back to onshore is a must.

JERA forms LNG buyers’ alliance with Korea Gas to guarantee LNG supply stability
(Company statement, April 10)
•  JERA and Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) signed an MoU to guarantee LNG supply stability through
swaps, trading, shipping optimization and exchange of market information.
•  JERA seeks to set up similar schemes with other LNG buyers in and outside Japan.
•  CONTEXT: JERA, the leading global LNG buyer, purchases 37 million tons/ year. KOGAS was the

world’s largest buyer until JERA’s establishment in 2015.
• TAKEAWAY: Nippon Steel and South Korea’s Posco formed a similar iron ore buyers alliance that later
developed into joint upstream investments, long-term contract negotiations and cross-shareholding. The latter
is something that is unlikely for JERA and KOGAS since the Korean company is state-owned. Meanwhile,
expansion of the buyer’s alliance to other Japanese companies, notably the EPCOs (former regional power
monopolies), may not be possible until the full separation of power generation units from other grid operating

business and other assets.


Sumitomo Metal Mining to start lithium production overseas in 2028

(Japan NRG, Nikkei Asia, April 11)
•  Sumitomo Metal Mining plans to start lithium production overseas in 2028; it developed a new
absorbent material that speeds up lithium extraction from brine raw materials.
•  SMM told Japan NRG that its lithium extraction R&D achieved a breakthrough but the tech isn’t
ready for commercial use. 2028 is too early to start lithium production.
•  CONTEXT: SMM has been developing a new absorbent material for lithium extraction since 2021.
Its goal was to launch a pilot test of the new method by 2030. It may possibly be looking for sites

to conduct the tests.
• TAKEAWAY: The success of SMM’s tech would depend on its cost and environmental impact. There are
several technologies to extract lithium from raw materials and Sumitomo Corp invests in one of them, the U.S.-
based Lilac Solutions. As SMM does not own any lithium mines, it will need to make new project investments if
it plans to secure lithium production.

(Asia Nikkei, April 11)
•  U.S. LNG developer Tellurian is in talks with Japanese and Indian companies about investing in its

planned LNG plant, Driftwood, in Louisiana that’s set to start in 2027.
•  Annual capacity will be about 11 million tons in the first phase, and would equal more than 10% of
Japan’s LNG demand. However, the project took a hit after two of its top customers, Shell and
Vitol, canceled long-term deals last year.

Kobe Steel and Mitsui to study plans for a large low-CO2 iron factory in Oman
(Asia Nikkei, April 11)
•  Kobe Steel and Mitsui signed a MoU to potentially build a new direct-reduced iron (DRI) factory in
Oman. The facility would use low-carbon steel feedstock and start as early as in 2027. At 5 million

tons of annual capacity, it would be one of the world’s largest.
•  DRI is made by removing oxygen from iron ore using hydrogen or natural gas; the resulting
material can be used in blast furnaces or electric-arc furnaces.
•  The plant would use natural gas, but could further cut emissions by utilizing green hydrogen.
Mitsui will supply iron ore and natural gas; Kobe Steel will use the factory’s end product in its blast
furnaces or sell it to other steelmakers.
•  CONTEXT: The steel sector is one of Japan’s top CO2 emitters.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

Part II: Japan looks to a new tech to kickstart its solar boom
Last week we published Part I of this article, which outlined the rise and decline of
Japan’s solar panel manufacturing industry. This week, we focus on a new innovative
technology, perovskite solar cells (PSC), which Japan is betting big on in order to
stimulate domestic production in solar infrastructure.

Almost 15 years ago, just as the sun began to set on Japan’s solar panel industry, a
ray of light appeared that gave hope to dispel the pessimism. In 2009, Prof. Tsutomu
Miyasaka of Toin University of Yokohama made the world’s first demonstration of a
new solar tech known as PSC.

While perovskite minerals had been discovered more than 150 years ago, Miyasaka
was the first to incorporate their compound structure into a solar cell. The power
conversion efficiency achieved by Miyasak was low, and the cell was stable for only a
matter of minutes. But the experiment gave birth to a new solar technology. And
since the research originated in Japan, the government fostered hope that it could
help the country recover its position as a solar energy leader.

The path of PSC technology since then has been challenging as the cost of current
solar panels has declined precipitously. But if Japan were to achieve commercially
viable PSC-based renewable power generation, it could be a game changer not only
for the country itself but the energy transition as a whole.

After years in the lab, the technology is now starting to see the light of day. Last
month, Japan’s biggest power utility, JERA, launched a PSC demo at one of its
thermal power stations. This high-profile experiment is deploying three mini-module
prototypes developed by Osaka-based Sekisui Chemical. And while the scale of the
demo is not large, JERA says it sees great potential in the technology, which can be
installed along the walls and other parts of the power plant’s facilities.

According to the most optimistic prognosis, perovskite solar power may hit
commercial scale as soon as by 2025.

The science behind PSC
What is a perovskite solar cell (PSC)? The cell is made of thin layers of chemicals and is
only 1 micrometer thick, less than 1% that of a silicon solar panel. It is also far lighter.
One of the layers has a crystal structure consisting of two positively charged and one
negative ions. This layer is called perovskite. Similar to silicon, this layer absorbs light
and converts it into electricity. Perovskite is sandwiched between two layers, which
help electrons to flow and produce electric current.











Source: Molecular Materials and Nanosystems (M2N) research group

There are various metal oxides that can turn into perovskite structures. The main ones
are lead, tin and titanium, all of which are widely available. Such abundance of raw
material candidates makes the scale-up of PSC look promising.


Key properties of PSC
Other positive factors include production efficiency and low energy requirements. The
PSC production process is short:
1. Make a perovskite solution
2. Roll it or spray it on sheet materials, stack up electron and hole transport layers,
as well as electrodes and contact interlayers, to form a module.

The process takes place at temperatures of 100 C, which is much less energy intensive
than silicon. Since PSC is light and thin, it can be bent, shaped flexibly and installed
upright in building walls. The layers are semi-transparent and can even be installed on
windows, as well as in other areas with space constraints.


Upcoming PSC projects
Several domestic Japanese PSC projects could define whether this niche will have a
future. In addition to JERA’s demo project, a number of outdoor field studies of PSCs
will be launched, five years after the world’s first demo project in Poland.
•  In February, Toshiba Energy Systems said it will start testing PSC modules not
directly exposed to the sun by installing a film-based module on a public
pathway connecting a railway station in Yokoyama.
•  In April, Sekisui Chemical and NTT Data will start testing PSC on building
exteriors. Sekisui will install its module on a water system operated by the
Tokyo Metropolitan Government, to measure the impact of moisture. In the
future, Tokyo sees the potential to add modules to water treatment systems.
•  Sekisui has also partnered with the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) to
conduct field tests at the new Umekita station that opens in 2025.

Target date: 2025
Market observers say 2025 will be a milestone year for PSCs, when grants for many
government-funded PSC research projects expire. Under the state scenario, this
means PSC as a technology will need to move onto the stage of mass production, and
by 2030 it should be available on a fully commercial basis in the market.
The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) has
financed six projects, including at Aisin and Tokyo University, which are developing 30
cm2 modules with a 20% power efficiency, with a target cost of ¥20/ kWh. They aim to
beat silicon module production costs, which amount to about ¥50/ kWh.

Companies planning entry into the PSC market, whether as a supplier for perovskite
chemical feedstock or manufacturer of building materials with embedded modules,
are expected to make their final business decisions around 2025 as the practical specs
around the technology become clearer.

Chemical Industry, which has made perovskite materials since 2014, Spiro-meOTAD
alone costs ¥50,000/ gram. While the chemicals involved are inexpensive, the
processing is lengthy and complicated, which drives up costs.

All in all, the cost of producing one square meter of PSC module weighing 1,500
grams comfortably exceeds the ¥30,000 market price for the same-size silicon PV
panel. This suggests that lower cost materials and production techniques are needed
before PSC can move to commercialization.

Also, PSCs will likely require a power efficiency above 20% to be competitive. Recent
reports describe some prototype PSC modules as hitting that target and even
reaching 30% efficiency, but the units in question are tiny: one cm squared, or smaller.
When enlarged, the same modules lose efficiency due to the difficulty of evenly
distributing molecules.

In spite of all this, a dramatic cut in production costs will be essential for PSC to
compete with silicon modules, the cost of which comes at around ¥40-50/ watt.

PSC modules also face durability and production scalability issues. While Toshiba
Energy Systems holds the domestic record for PSC power efficiency (16.6%), the
company told Japan NRG that it won’t use those 16.6% modules for the public
pathway test outside the Aobadai train station.

Sekisui Chemical claims its prototype PSC modules can last 10 years. That’s an
impressive number, according to Sekisui’s project partner, JERA. Earlier iterations of
PSC technology lasted only a few years. But in comparison with silicon PV panels,
which typically last 30 years, this is another minus. Many solar projects need at least
10 years to repay their financing.

Short lifespans mean PSC systems would require frequent replacements, which is
especially problematic for modules embedded in walls or windows. Furthermore,
many believe PSC to be vulnerable to changes in air pressure, moisture, and other
physical shocks. PSC pioneers like Sekisui and Toshiba will need to find effective
solutions for this through their outdoor trials.

One final issue to consider will be PSC’s reliance on lead. According to the University
of Electro-Communications, lead accounts for 30% of the weight of current PSC
modules. While Japan's regulations on lead are less restrictive than the EU, lead
content needs to be controlled especially for water and waste management.

Consumers will not be able to dispose of lead-heavy equipment without a specialist
recycling system in place, which is another cost item. Alternatively, PSCs will need to
switch to other metals.


Future of the PSC market
With such a list of challenges, the fate of JERA’s demo PSC project is of interest to
many market players. While many are enthused by the properties of PSC, few see the
new technology squeezing the market for silicon-based panels in the next two
decades.

Instead, the thin, lightweight and flexible modules are likely to create entirely new

21

market niches. The fact that PSC does not require racks could also spread its
popularity for micro environments and tight spaces.

Since PSCs absorb a larger spectrum of light compared to silicon, in theory they can
generate power in the absence of sun. One possibility is power generation in closed
spaces, such as devices with built-in perovskite systems mounted on EVs. PSCs are
transparent like cellophane tape, and they do not block out light.

This feature could be exploited at farms that install PSC systems above ground but
still grow crops on the land. The University of Electro-Communications sees potential
for a market that’s over ¥1 trillion in size for each of the three possible applications.


Competition for a better PSC future
At the end of the day, competition will foster better products and expand markets.
Even high raw material costs should spur further efficiency breakthroughs.

One such industry optimist is a Japan-Sino joint venture that claims to have achieved
cost cuts of several percentage points already thanks to improved project
management and by allocating some processes to Chinese facilities, the company
told Japan NRG. Of course, this could also be a disadvantage if manufacturing of the
new tech moves to China and mirrors the trend of silicon PVs in the early 2000s.

Meanwhile, Chinese silicon PV makers are also innovating to make their panels
thinner, lighter and cheaper. Perhaps this is the biggest lesson from the rise and fall of
Japan’s silicon PV sector. Creating the best technology will not be enough. Japan will
also need to create a profitable domestic market for the technology in order for it to
take root.

ANALYSIS

BY CHISAKI WATANABE

Japan prepares to bet big on deep-water offshore wind in the EEZ
Japan is updating its ocean policy with an eye on utilizing its exclusive economic zone
to expand the wind power generation. This should turbocharge the local deployment
of floating turbines amid rising global competition for the technology.

Promoting floating wind power technology is a key part of the maritime strategy
mapped out in the draft of the Fourth Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, soon to be
approved by Prime Minister Kishida’s cabinet.

The Basic Plan is updated every five years and the current draft was open to public
comment until early April. It consists of policy measures and strategies to cover a
range of issues from national security threats to natural disasters, such as typhoons
and high tides, as well as energy-related issues that concern ocean resources.

One of the plan’s focus points is the utilization of Japan’s exclusive economic zone
(EEZ), which is an area extending 200 nautical miles (about 370 km) from the nation’s
shore. Within the EEZ, countries have exclusive rights to explore and exploit natural
resources under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Expanding offshore wind into the EEZ means that available areas for development will
dramatically increase. Current development is based entirely on Japan’s territorial
waters, which limits projects to within 22 km from shore.


Setting targets for floating offshore
While Japan’s land area is relatively small, its maritime area and EEZ come in at some
4.47 million km2, the world’s sixth largest. This equals nearly 12 times Japan’s land
mass.

According to an MoE database, Japan has the potential to install 783 GW of floating
offshore wind capacity, more than twice the 337 GW potential for fixed-bottom
turbine units.

In the Basic Plan, the government highlighted the importance of expanding offshore
wind power generation. Installing turbines in the ocean is key to making renewables a
main source of electricity and crucial for carbon neutrality goals.

The plan also noted that there’s a growing need to utilize the EEZ to further Japan’s
wind power ambitions and that floating units will be the main turbine technology
given the characteristics of the surrounding ocean. To that end, the government will
now set specific targets for floating offshore wind and promote technology
development. Legislation is to be prepared to deploy offshore wind in the EEZ
starting with reviews of related laws such as UNCLOS, according to the plan.

This summer, the government will reconvene a public-private council on offshore wind
to come up with industrial strategies and targets for floating installations in the EEZ by
March 2024, according to an action plan released earlier this month by a task force
chaired by PM Kishida. The new targets for floating turbines will be part of the
government’s overall strategy to install up to 45 GW in offshore wind capacity by
2040.


Legal nuances
As for legal frameworks, the government has already taken its first steps. In January,
an expert panel appointed by the Cabinet Office released a report after a series of
discussions on legal issues for offshore wind farms in Japan’s EEZ and how to interpret
the UN’s law of the sea.

This panel concluded that offshore wind turbines and related facilities can be
categorized as “installations and structures” that the coastal State in the EEZ has
jurisdiction over because their primary purpose is to produce wind energy, as per the
UNCLOS (Article 56).

Other key points made by the panel:
1. So long as necessary procedures are taken under domestic laws, the coastal State
can issue approvals for research and development, and conduct inspections during
periods of construction, operation and maintenance, and the dismantling of offshore
wind farms in the EEZ.
2. The coastal State may designate safety zones within 500 meters from the outer
limits of offshore wind power stations in the EEZ.

The second point is important since ships must respect safety zones and need to
comply with generally accepted standards for navigation near installations, structures
and safety zones.

At least nine countries already have offshore wind power stations in their EEZ either in
operation or in the pipeline. In East Asia alone, China and South Korea each have
plans for nearly 10 GW of offshore wind capacity within their EEZs. South Korea plans
for all but one of its projects to use floating turbines; China expects to rely only on
bottom-fixed units.

Ocean synergies
Offshore wind power is not the only opportunity in the EEZ. The Basic Plan also sheds
light on Japan’s marine resource development, saying that energy and a stable supply
of mineral resources are essential for the national economy.
There are energy and mineral resources on the sea bottom in the EEZ, such as
methane hydrate, oil, natural gas, cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, manganese
nodules and deep-sea mud containing rare earths, according to the plan.

These are used in power generation from renewable sources and the manufacture of
electric vehicles. Japan relies on their imports, and counts on a limited number of
countries for processing and refining. While it may take years before such subsea
resources become commercially available, floating offshore wind is a proven
technology and could spur subsea resource development.

Expanding the wind deployment area into Japan’s EEZ comes with its own challenges.
For example, installing turbines in the EEZ means equipment must be shipped further,
requiring longer time for construction and O&M. Also, more copper is required for
cables to carry electricity to shore.

Meanwhile, Japan will have to compete with neighboring countries, especially South
Korea, to procure the equipment for floating wind power projects, as well as the
vessels to transport and install it.

Setting targets for floating offshore wind is just the first step for Japan to show its
commitment to this promising technology.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

China/ Critical raw materials
Beijing is expanding export restrictions on critical minerals, leading to higher prices of
raw materials for the clean energy transition, according to an OECD report. More than
13,000 restrictions were passed by late 2020, and even more introduced since then.

Germany/ Nuclear power
The last of three nuclear power stations closed this weekend, ending a six-decade
nuclear energy program. The closures were spurred on by Japan’s 2011 Fukushima
NPP accident. Germany aims for fully-renewable electricity generation by 2035.

Gulf of Mexico/ Oil
BP started pumping crude through its new $9 billion Argos deepwater offshore
platform in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This is the biggest new project in the region in
more than a decade, and can pump 140,000 bpd from subsea oil and gas fields.

Indonesia/ Gas pipeline
By Q1 2024, national oil company Petroliam Nasional Berhad plans to restart a gas
pipeline. In October, Petronas announced a force majeure on gas supply to Malaysia
due to a leak on its Sabah-Sarawak Gas Pipeline.

Netherlands/ CO2 emissions
The government will support Shell to reduce CO2 and nitrogen emissions. Shell is one
of the country's largest polluters, and plans to cut 3.9 megatons of CO2 emissions
from its Dutch plants by 2030. Shell's plan equals 20% of Dutch industry’s total goal in
cutting CO2.

Netherlands/ Russian LNG
The government plans to end all LNG imports from Russia, said Dutch energy minister
Rob Jetten. The Netherlands stopped signing new contracts for Russian LNG imports
this year and will wind down pre-existing contracts.

Russia/ Oil exports
Seaborne oil product exports rose in March by 17.3% month-on-month. Volumes
increased to 12.374 million tons from 9.53 million in February. A full embargo of
Russian oil product exports to the EU went into effect on Feb.5.

Thailand/ Green hydrogen
Saudi Arabian renewables developer ACWA Power signed a $7 billion agreement with
two state-owned Thai companies to produce 225,000 tons of green hydrogen each
year; that’s equal to about 1.2 million tons of green ammonia. Production will be in
Thailand.

U.S./ Critical raw materials
General Motors will invest in lithium technology startup EnergyX to ensure long-term
supplies for EV batteries. The global rush by automakers to electrify their cars has led
to a push for stable supplies of lithium, copper, nickel and other critical minerals.

U.S./ EVs
Americans are more motivated by saving money on gas than climate change. Only
41% are somewhat likely to purchase an EV because they believe the upfront costs
outweigh fuel and maintenance savings, according to the University of Chicago.

Wind and solar power
Wind and solar energy accounted for a record 12% of global electricity generation last
year, up from 10% in 2021, said think tank Ember. It studied power sector data from
78 countries in its annual global electricity review, representing 93% of global power
demand.
