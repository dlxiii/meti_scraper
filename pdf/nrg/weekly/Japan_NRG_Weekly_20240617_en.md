NEWS:     ENERGY      TRANSITION        &  POLICY





Japan explores recycling mandate for solar panels as disposal is set to peak in mid 2030s

(Nikkei, June 12)
•  Japan is exploring legislation to mandate recycling of solar panels that are no longer fit for use.
The Diet is expected to deliberate on a proposal next year.
•  Solar farm operators are obliged by waste disposal laws to transfer spent panels to disposal
contractors. These recycle aluminum and other critical materials, but panels usually end up in
landfills.
•  A recycling mandate for solar panels will require owners to pay recycling fees.

•  The MoE estimates that between 500,000 and 800,000 tons of spent solar panels will be disposed
of annually.
•  CONTEXT: Given that solar farms expanded rapidly after Japan introduced the FIT system in 2012,
and the typical lifespan for solar panels is 20 to 30 years, disposal is expected to soar in the mid-
2030s.
• TAKEAWAY: The MoE says that potential challenges include insufficient capacity to handle waste disposal, and
the lack of detailed information on materials used in panels by Chinese manufacturers. The Diet will need to

propose measures to overcome these challenges; but at the moment, there is a lack of clarity on the issue.
Developers will also need to start taking into account these future recycling fees when creating a cost model
for the project.




Nippon Steel makes first shipment of green steel tubes, to Qatar's blue ammonia plant
(Company statement, June 14)
•  Nippon Steel began shipment to Qatar of seamless steel tubes made of ‘green steel’, to be used

for a 1.2 mln tons/ year blue ammonia plant built by QatarEnergy. The plant goes online in 2026.
•  The green steel tubes follow the production methodology specified in the NSCarbolex Neutral
process developed by the company.
•  The corrosion resistant seamless tubes will be used for pipelines that transport carbon and other
gases to storage sites.
•  CONTEXT: Nippon Steel’s seamless tubes contain a high ratio of molybdenum, chrome and other
rare metals to strengthen the steel, and are more expensive than ordinary steel without these

elements. The company says strong steel is needed as the gas mix transported through the pipes
contains impurities.
• TAKEAWAY: This is Nippon Steel’s first major green steel sale to a CCS customer overseas. This will raise its
profile in the energy transition business as the Qatari ammonia plant is the world’s biggest to date. Nippon
Steel has a large market share of seamless tubes used for oil and gas pipelines in severe natural conditions.

In return for this contract, it would not be surprising to see Japanese buyers strike deals for offtake from the
Ammonia-7 Project. QatarEnergy’s affiliates, QatarEnergy Renewable Solutions and Qatar Fertiliser Company

(QAFCO) are the marketing entities in charge of the project. A Qatari ammonia cargo was reportedly delivered
to Japan in February.




Energy issues could be impetus for growth: Big-Boned Policy
(Government statement, June 11)
•  The Cabinet published the preliminary FY2024 Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management

and Reform, also known as the Big-Boned Policy. It said increases in personal spending and
business investments are essential to move onto the next “economic stage” where wages and
corporate earnings rise in cycles.
•  Issues such as energy security, population decline, etc could be impetus for future growth. Energy
security is about raising energy self-sufficiency, and renewables and nuclear power will not only
contribute to security but also mitigate global warming.
•  The government plans schemes to support Perovskite solar cells and floating wind power tech

developments and their social deployment, as well as SAF, storage battery deployment, carbon
recycling, etc.
•  CONTEXT: The FY2023 Big-Boned Policy talked about energy in great length as Green
Transformation (GX) was its core. This year, following the successful launch of the GX League and
laws on decarbonized power sources, CCS and hydrogen supply chains, the focus shifted to
speedy exit from the deflationary economy.
• TAKEAWAY: Most energy policy content repeated last year’s policy but there were subtle differences. The

FY2024 Big-Boned Policy said clearly renewables were to be the main power source of the future, but added,
“it needed to expand as much as possible provided there is harmony with community stakeholders and
consumers’ financial burdens are minimized”; The FY2023 policy said renewables were the highest priority.
The FY2024 policy made no mention of the pan-Asian framework to jointly run the LNG stockpiles to boost
regional energy security that was elaborated on last year.




ANRE gathers feedback on power market deregulation

(Denki Shimbun, June 11)
•  The long-running program by METI and ANRE to gather views from experts on current and
planned power system reforms has entered the final stages.
•  ANRE plans to begin full-fledged verification of new proposals in July, taking into account the
challenges in the business environment.
•  The current phase of the process began in January, led by a subcommittee chaired by Hirotaka
Yamauchi, a professor at Musashino University.
•  Comments so far include:

o  Concerns about securing capacity in light of tight supply-demand
o  The need to discuss the state of power generation firms and whether the capacity market
functions properly
o  Some suggested that the regulated rate for retail electric utilities is distorting the power
system reform and called for the abolition of those rates;

Japan emissions-monitoring startup raises $26 mln
(Company statement, June 13)
•  Asuene, a Tokyo-based climate tech startup, has raised $26.7 million in its Series C round led by
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, etc.
•  Asuene plans to raise a total of $31.8 million, including the upcoming second close, bringing

cumulative funding to $64 million in the Series C. The funding involves third-party allotment to a
total of 17 domestic and international investors, including existing shareholders.
•  Asuene is offering products focused on decarbonization; in particular, its CO2 visualization,
reduction, and reporting cloud service.
•  The company now plans “aggressive” recruitment of top talent, M&A, and capital partnerships
with major manufacturing companies.
•  CONTEXT: Companies are facing pressure to report GHGs. In March, the Sustainability Standards

Board of Japan proposed disclosure requirements for supply-chain-wide emissions as well as
reduction targets, aimed at businesses listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Prime market. Prime-
listed companies valued at ¥3 trillion or more are expected to be required to provide emissions-
related information as early as FY2026.
• TAKEAWAY: Asuene has aspirations to become a global leader in GHG tracking and emission reduction
solutions and believes it can expand in Southeast Asia and North America due to the already strong presence

of Japanese manufacturers in those regions. The latter would form part of its customer base, according to
comments made by Asuene executives in recent months. With so few Japanese startups in the business
services space going global, it will be interesting to see if Asuene can buck the trend.

Honda and Mitsubishi set up firm ALTNA to utilize used EV batteries in power grid

(Company statement, June 13)
•  In July, automakers Honda Motor and Mitsubishi will establish a JV, to be called ALTNA, to work
on EV technology and battery optimization.
•  The new firm will utilize batteries that are no longer used in cars as secondary storage batteries for
the power grid.
•  EV batteries that hold 60% to 70% of their original charge can still be useful as storage batteries,
said the companies.

•  Honda will remotely monitor these EV batteries, paying attention to the deterioration in their
charging capacity. A function will automatically recharge the batteries when electricity costs are
low.
•  The power stored will be offered to the wholesale power market, the supply-demand adjustment
market, and capacity market.
•  The firms also plan to recycle rare metal resources and stabilize the supply and demand of electric
power.

•  Fukui Seiichi, president of Mitsubishi, will also serve as ALTNA’s president. Both firms will have a
50% stake in the JV.
•  CONTEXT: In October 2022, JERA and Toyota Motor announced construction and launch of the
world's first large-capacity Sweep Energy Storage System. The system was built using different
grades of batteries reclaimed from electrified vehicles (HEV, PHEV, BEV, FCEV) and is connected
to the consumer electrical power grid.
• TAKEAWAY: As demand for storage batteries grows it’s necessary to have supply-stabilizing tools when

expanding renewable energy. At the same time, limited supplies of battery materials including cobalt and
lithium, mean there is a need for environmentally friendly initiatives, such as reclaiming used EV batteries for
use as storage batteries. Although it is hard to see such projects working at scale for now, as the number of
electric vehicles increases it could turn into a viable business model.

•  The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) said building a new experimental research reactor at the
Monju site will cost about ¥150 billion. The agency sees the potential to build a 10 MW or less
light-water cooled, heavy-water moderated swimming pool type reactor. The goal is to achieve the

highest level of neutron flux.
•  There are three options, and a decision will be made by year’s end. This includes:
o  ¥60 billion for producing and installing reactor equipment
o  ¥20 billion for construction
o  ¥20 billion for design development
o  ¥8.5 billion for geological surveys
o  ¥20 billion for developing and manufacturing site equipment

o  ¥20 billion for civil engineering works
•  The timeline from the installation permit application to the start of operations is about 8 years for a
HTTR (High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor); and 7 years for STACY (Static Experiment
Critical Facility).
•  CONTEXT: By 2028, the govt plans to test hydrogen production using nuclear power. This follows
JAEA's successful safety test of its HTTR, Japan’s first and only high-temperature gas-cooled

reactor. In 2004, it became the world’s first to achieve a reactor outlet coolant temperature of
950°C under full thermal power of 30 MW. In early 2010, the HTTR operated for 50 days at high
temperature and full power.

Kyushu Electric’s Sendai NPP Unit 1 to begin regular inspections
(Company statement, June 12)
•  On June 14, Kyushu Electric began a regular inspection of Unit 1 of the Sendai NPP, (Kagoshima
Pref).
•  It’s scheduled to resume operation on Sep 25. The PWR unit's output is 890 MW.

•  CONTEXT: Unit 1 will reach 40 years of operation this year. In November 2023, NRA extended the
operating period for up to 20 years. The company's Genkai NPP Unit 4 (Saga Pref) is also under
regular inspections, to be completed by late June. Sendai NPP Unit 2 begins inspections in
September.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
TEPCO: inspections at Unit 7 Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP completed

(Nikkei, June 13)
o  TEPCO said all inspections at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP Unit 7 are completed.
o  Although there’s a lack of local consent needed for restart, the facilities are technically
ready for restart. The NPP director said that local support is essential for the facility to
come online.
o  On the same day, the METI minister met with Niigata Pref Governor who said trust in

TEPCO remains low, and the govt should address TEPCO’s shortcomings in
management and evacuation plans.
o  CONTEXT: Fuel loading into the reactor began on April 15.
• TAKEAWAY: The governor is clearly stalling, nervous about giving green-light to a TEPCO nuclear power plant
after all the history of the past 10-15 years. The ruling LDP party and current PM Kishida have low ratings and
cannot afford to exert too much political pressure on Niigata. Publicly stating that it will take on full
responsibility for any repercussions from the restart may be one way for the central govt to move this forward.

Another driver could be an energy shortage and rising power prices.

project’s viability. Rumors appeared that Japan’s JGC Holding would take over from Zachry, but
the company last week denied them.
•  The project is valued at around $10 billion. Clients have ordered the work to resume, allowing
Chiyoda to use Zachry's equipment for a fee.




LNG stocks down 5.8% from previous week
(Government data, June 12)
•  As of June 9, the LNG stocks of 10 power utilities were 2.1 million tons, down 5.8% from the

up from the five-year average of 2.01 million tons.
•  For the past two months, LNG stocks have hovered at about 2 million tons. A hot summer is
expected and utilities anticipate higher than usual air-cooling demand.
•  CONTEXT: There’s been an uptick in spot power prices over the last week due to an outage at a
coal-fired power plant in the Tohoku region, which has caused a switch to more gas use. Tohoku
Electric and Kansai Electric have been among the more active utilities in the LNG spot market
recently.

ANALYSIS

BY FILIPPO PEDRETTI
Nuclear’s Role in the Power Mix Hangs in the Balance;

Tomari NPP as a Case Study
In the last decade, Japan has restarted a third of its nuclear reactors. To hit the
government targets for the sector within the power mix, and help play a role in cutting
the nation’s emissions, at least another third of the reactors have to come back online.

The problem is, the updated regulatory environment and the need for a social buy-in
has arguably made each new restart in Japan harder, not easier. Even a new nuclear
facility, such as the third unit of the Tomari NPP, on the northern island of Hokkaido,
has spent over three times as long under regulatory review than in operation.

As Japan seeks to overhaul and decarbonize its energy sector, nuclear power has
been allocated an important role by the government. The traditionally CO2-free,
stable and low-cost electricity from the NPPs is seen by officials as also supporting the
recent local revitalization of the semiconductor sector.


While METI is keen to retain nuclear power as ideally providing 20-22% of the nation’s
electricity, the deliberations of officials over the next Basic Energy Plan have to take
into consideration a stark reality: Restarting an NPP in Japan is not just hard, it’s
unpredictable. Prime Minister Kishida has already failed to deliver on the quick restarts
promised two years ago. This raises the question as to how much should state and
business officials rely on nuclear energy in 2030 and beyond.

Japan NRG will review the situation around the Tomari NPP as a case study into the
factors that are driving the nuclear restart story.

Historical context and current status
Before the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and Fukushima Daiichi NPP disaster, nuclear
power was a pillar of Japan's energy mix, at just less than 30% of the total. The
nuclear accident led to the halt of all the reactors, bringing nuclear power's share to
zero by 2013. To compensate for the loss, Japan has since relied mostly on coal and
natural gas, as well as rapidly developing its solar capacity.

In 2015, Japan restarted the two units of Sendai NPP on the island of Kyushu, under
new safety rules. But after an initial spurt of restarts in Kyushu and the Kansai region,
progress ground to a halt. Most of the nuclear plants that remain under regulatory
review today have some long-standing issues from a technical or community
perspective.

The sector’s fortunes, however, took a turn for the better in 2022. After a sharp spike
in fossil fuel prices following Russia’s incursion into Ukraine, concern about energy
security and costs helped bring public approval of restarts above the 50% level for the
first time since the Fukushima disaster. This made it more palatable for local politicians
to green-light restarts, and encouraged METI to bring out the first roadmap for
building new nuclear plants and technologies in over a decade.

While the share of nuclear in the electricity mix has ticked up close to double digits
last year, from about 5.5% in FY2022, and nuclear’s 20-22% share of the 2030 power
mix was confirmed by the GX Decarbonization Power Supply Bill, the actual pace of
restarts has been painful.

This year, only Shimane NPP Unit 2 and Onagawa NPP Unit 2 are expected to restart;
the first in August, the second in September. This will add about 1.6 GW.

Currently, 12 reactors are operational in Japan, with a total capacity of 11.6 GW. Last
year, nuclear contributed 81.08 TWh of the total electricity consumption of 851.12
TWh. OCCTO expects power demand to hover around 857 TWh in 2031. For nuclear
to hit its 20-22% share, based on today’s consumption figures and average reactor run
rate, Japan NRG estimates that another 14.2 GW of capacity needs to be put online.

Depending on reactor size, that can mean the restart of a further 10-16 units. There
are only 33 reactors that qualify as operable in the country, although not all of these
have even applied for NRA review. Another three units are listed as “under
construction”, and one of those recently won funding via the long-term
decarbonization power source auction (LTDA).

Today’s hot topic
One of the biggest restart debates today is around TEPCO's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP.
For starters, it is equipped with boiling water reactors (BWRs). The reactors at
Fukushima Daiichi were BWRs. Of Japan's 33 reactors, 17 are BWRs and the rest are
pressurized water reactor (PWR) designs. If a unit at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa were to
restart, it would be the first BWR to be brought online since the 2011 disaster, and it
would also be the first operated by TEPCO.


Other reactors under the microscope include Japan Atomic Power’s Tokai No. 2 in
Ibaraki Prefecture and Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 in Fukui Prefecture. For the former, there’s
no clear outlook for a restart due to issues with evacuation plans and a halt-of-
operations order issued by a district court. The latter has been undergoing NRA
reviews since 2015.

Case study: Tomari NPP
Hokkaido’s only nuclear power generation capacity, Tomari NPP, is among those
awaiting restart. Units 1 and 2 have a capacity of 579 MW each; Unit 3 has a capacity
of 912 MW.

Commissioned in 2009, Unit 3 was in the last phase of regular inspections at the time
of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. In August of that same year, it became the first
reactor to restart after the disaster, but after a regular inspection began in 2012 it has
remained offline.

Alongside other operators, in 2013 Hokkaido Electric applied to the NRA to review
the Tomari facility under the new, improved safety criteria. While many of the Kansai
and Kyushu reactors passed the reviews, Tomari remains under regulatory scrutiny 11
years later.

Tomari’s problems are several. First, the plant failed to provide explanations regarding
safety measures, apparently due to there not being sufficient staff capable of handling
safety procedures. The NRA claims that the plant does not have enough trained
experts who can discuss issues related to the threat posed by tsunamis and
earthquakes. Hokkaido Electric has since pledged to train such specialized personnel.

Another issue was the construction of a seawall at the plant as tsunami defense. In
2022, the Sapporo District Court ruled that Hokkaido Electric should not operate the
plant due to a lack of safety assurances over the solidity of the ground underneath the
16.5-meter seawall. The decision came after about 1,000 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in
2011 to request the plant’s decommissioning.

Hokkaido Electric was requested to rebuild its seawall on solid bedrock. The new
version is expected to be 19 meters high, 30 meters wide, and 1,200 meters in length.
The company has completed soil reinforcement. At the end of April, the NRA visited
the plant and found no issues with the seawall work or with reactor-related equipment
at the site.

Rising costs and demand
The cost of upgrading Hokkaido Electric’s seawall was around ¥180 billion. A further
¥200 billion was spent on other safety improvements to allow for a restart. And yet,
NRA reviews and public safety assessments continue. Hokkaido Electric had hoped to
restart Unit 3 by December 2026, but this date is earlier than the estimated timeframe
for completion of the new seawall (2027).

This June, the company is due to give an update of Tomari’s status to the NRA.
Originally, such a report was scheduled for January; it was subsequently delayed,
twice, due to problems in preparing the necessary explanations for new tsunami-
related preventive measures.

The company also has to train new plant operators. Given that Tomari has been offline
since 2012, just over half of its current employees reportedly have no experience of
running a reactor beyond training on simulators. This is a problem common to other
NPPs.

The timing of Tomari's restart is critical not only for Hokkaido Electric. Semiconductor
producer Rapidus aims to begin full-scale operations of its factory in Chitose,
Hokkaido in 2027. Rapidus plans to rely on renewable energy but considers CO2-free
electricity from Tomari a vital backup.

Notably, Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer TSMC chose to establish its first
Japanese factory in Kumamoto, which is the only region in the country with high
nuclear and renewables volumes.

Adherence to safety is paramount
Of course, one way to sell a skeptical public on the need for nuclear restarts is the
price of electricity. Rate payers in Hokkaido, which currently has no reactors online,
pay an average of ¥9,523 per household. Those in Kansai, which relies on nuclear
power more than other regions in Japan, pay ¥7,664; in Kyushu it’s ¥7,551.

Still, the promise of lower bills alone won’t be enough. Regional and local politicians,
who need to sign off on a restart, fear public blowback in case of accidents more than
economic hardships. This year’s Noto Earthquake spooked some officials.

Unless the public and political resolve changes, the current pace of restarts will not
allow the nation to hit its 2030 nuclear targets. Beyond that, from the late 2030s, the
licensing terms of existing units will start to expire.


In practical terms, nuclear operators and energy planners have until the end of this
decade to show that the industry’s decline can be reversed, which begins by
accelerating the pace of restarts. If not, the only option remaining would be to rethink
the energy strategy itself.

How Sinking Auction-based Power Rates Are Impacting

PV Generators in Japan
Japan’s national strategy calls for more solar energy in the nation’s power mix. But
many of the smaller businesses that helped build the sector from scratch a decade
ago say the returns are no longer attractive.

Additional regulation, a shift towards market-based pricing, and the need to commit
to greater community engagement no longer make solar projects economically
feasible for smaller operators. Meanwhile, an industry consolidation trend via M&A
and increased private equity inflows are changing the structure of the domestic solar
sector.

Current energy policy envisions about one-fifth of the nation’s mix eventually coming
from solar power, which became a priority in the wake of the 2011 nuclear disaster.
While the rollout of new projects has slowed recently, solar is still described by the
government as one of the main drivers of additional power capacity this decade.


This year, with the update of the Basic Energy Plan, the status and future development
of the solar sector is expected to be updated. As well as addressing the fact that the
current rollout lags previously set 2030 targets, METI is expected to touch on the
impact of new solar tech such as flexible / Perovskite solar cells (PSC) and the
contributions from solar PVs on water, rooftops and other facilities.

Still, for many operators, the main questions will be about price. The government has
been on a relentless drive to push solar tariffs lower. But with land availability
decreasing and other above-mentioned challenges pushing costs upward, can Japan
afford to squeeze the smaller renewables firms any further?

Potential growth
Since Japan began to shift away from fossil fuels, the country has seen a tenfold
increase in installed solar power, from an estimated 5.6 GW as of June 2012 to around
56 GW of capacity in operation as of March 2021. The installed capacity was even
higher at 75.5 GW, and two years later that grew to 87 GW (DC) or 71 GW (AC). Of
the latter AC number, however, 8.9 GW was not classified as operational as of March
2023.

The Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA) says there’s still room to expand
solar power in the country. Technically, it calculates that it’s possible to introduce as
much as 2.38 TW of solar in Japan, which suggests that only 3-4% of the potential is
tapped to date.

In 2023, solar’s share in the national energy mix was 11.2%, while the ratio of all
renewables in the energy mix rose to 25.7%. The latter is supposed to hit 36-38% by
2030, according to the current Basic Energy Plan, but it will be updated – with new
2040 guidance – before March 2025.

Switching to market pricing
Ten years of solar capacity rollout were funded through a Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) system,
in which prices were guaranteed. Over this time, the FIT offered by the government
fell significantly, compressing margins. However, this isn’t the only factor operators
today have to contend with.

In April 2022, the government switched the majority of solar projects to the Feed-in-
Premium (FIP) system, in which payment depends in part on the market price of
electricity. The goal is to incentivize solar operators to move the sector to a more
market-based business model, rather than a state-subsidized one, but also to
encourage investments in additionalities such as batteries for energy storage.

Given the additional complexity, the FIP was introduced at a more generous range of
between ¥12 and ¥14/ kWh, more than was offered for commercial and industrial
systems under FIT. Within about a year, however, FIP auction prices dropped
dramatically, with some bidders giving away their right to earn a premium under this
mechanism and setting their bid at ¥0.

Essentially, these zero-yen bids were using the FIP mechanism to secure a grid
connection, while agreeing to take on all the commercial risk of negotiating electricity
sales contracts.

The auctions for FIT / FIP projects are overseen by state-run Organization for Cross-
regional Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO), and are open to solar
systems over 250 kW in size. OCCTO holds several auction rounds each year, with
four slated this year.


While OCCTO auctions continue to draw interest from the industry, the number of
bidders is noticeably shrinking.

Last year, OCCTO’s 16th solar auction round in July 2023, the first that year,
concluded with 119.7 MW of capacity being awarded FIP contracts, more than what
was initially offered. But the price cap was depressed further to ¥9.5/ kWh. As a result,
the average weighted winning price was just ¥9.34/ kWh. The lowest winning bid hit
¥9/ kWh.

This led to an outcry in the broader industry. According to JPEA, 81% of its solar
operator members said that they would struggle to generate electricity at a profit
from PV panels alone under such conditions. Industry players also pointed to a
widening gap between the price and rising supply costs and want government
procurement prices to rise by ¥2-3/ kWh.

Instead, prices have continued to drop. In subsequent OCCTO auction rounds, bids
hit as low as a range of ¥0 and ¥6.98/ kWh. Meanwhile, OCCTO has used the
opportunity to lower the price cap each time until it dipped to ¥8.98 by the end of
FY2024.

Winners and losers
For the bigger solar players, the changing circumstances have led to a change in
strategy. Developers have either sought greater scale, including through mergers or

capital infusions from private equity etc, or evolved their business model to try their
hand in battery storage, or wind power, or other clean energy directions.

Within just the last year or so, several new ‘platform’ businesses have entered Japan’s
solar market, such as Nozomi Energy (backed by British investment firm Actis), with
even more new entrants in the battery space but with aspirations to eventually expand
the green portfolio (Hexa Renewables, backed by I Squared Capital; CHC Energy,
backed by Stonepeak, etc).

Similar consolidation has taken place among domestic investors, with Toyota Tsusho
and Orix among the biggest buyers of solar and wind projects in Japan.

The scale of these growing operations has made them more aggressive in seeking out
better prices under corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) or by building out a
merchant business aligned with Japan’s burgeoning electricity market platforms.
Securing connectivity to the grid, even via a zero-yen auction, is worth more than tariff
income, a luxury that smaller developers without the resources to negotiate PPAs or
trade electricity cannot afford.

In late May, one of the world’s biggest tech giants Google announced two solar PPAs
in Japan that will add a combined 60 MW of solar capacity to the Japanese grid.
Google signed the contract with one of the largest trading houses, Itochu, and Shizen
Energy, a leading domestic renewables developer. With the agreements, Google will
procure renewable energy generated at the farms across Japan.


According to estimates based on physical PPAs, developers were selling electricity
and environmental attributes (also known as “green tags,” or “renewable-energy
credits”) to retailers in Japan at ¥11-12/ kWh for solar projects launched in 2022.
Today, these numbers are often several yen higher, and more.

Go big or go home
The consolidation of the solar industry should eventually help to revive the rollout of
new capacity in Japan and the appetite of private equity and Big Tech offtakers are
among the accelerator factors for the market.

The government, however, will need to consider whether it should throw the smaller
solar developers a lifeline. Big business is perhaps more likely to help drive the big
renewables expansion that the Basic Energy Plan calls for. But solar development is
also a ‘local’ business, in which people connections are vital to securing land and
community buy-in. Disenfranchising local developers may cause more issues than it
solves.

ASIA   ENERGY      REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

This weekly column focuses on energy events in Asia and the Pacific

Australia / Rooftop solar and BESS
Nexa Advisory recommended the New South Wales govt to increase uptake of
rooftop solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS) by the commercial and
industrial sector. This could capture 7 GW of additional power and help build grid
reliability.

China / Offshore wind
Mingyang Smart Energy and Germany’s BASF received approval from China for a 500
MW offshore wind farm off the coast of Guangdong province that they are co-
developing. The JV is 90% owned by Mingyang and 10% by BASF. It’s the first and
only Chinese-German offshore wind project.

China / Wind turbines
State-owned power generator manufacturer Dongfang Electric Corp said it
successfully installed an 18-MW offshore wind turbine, which is now considered to be
the largest in use globally.

Malaysia / Fuel subsidies
The govt introduced targeted retail diesel fuel subsidies in an effort to end its costly
blanket fuel subsidy program. The govt hopes this will strengthen its finances amid
economic difficulties and high oil prices.

Northeast Asia / Weather
Since June 8, high temperatures have persisted in North China and the Koreas. The
highest temperatures in some areas of southern Hebei and northern Shandong
exceeded 40°C.

Nuclear power
Asia will dominate nuclear power installations over the next 10 years, comprising 88%
of the projected 55.6 GW new projects from 2024 to 2033, said BMI. The region will
see over 49 GW of new capacity growth. Nuclear is key for the low-carbon energy
efforts of China and India.

Oil surplus
The world faces a “staggering surplus” of oil as companies boost production,
thwarting OPEC+ efforts to manage crude prices, said the IEA. Demand is forecast to
peak by 2030.

Pakistan / LNG
Pakistan is unlikely to buy LNG cargoes on the spot market until at least November
due to oversupply and high prices, the country’s oil minister told Reuters.

Philippines / Renewables
Energy company ACEN Corp plans to raise $15 billion. This is part of its 2030 target
to increase renewables capacity from 5 GW to 20 GW. This capital will be a mix of
debt and equity.

Sri Lanka / Nuclear power
The IAEA finished a seven-day safety review of Sri Lanka’s selection process to choose
sites where the country could build its first nuclear power plant. Six potential sites
have been identified.
