NEWS:     ENERGY       TRANSITION         &  POLICY


Prime Minister contest enters final days

•  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will vote on Wednesday, Sept. 29, to decide on its new
leader and, consequently, the nation’s prime minister.
•  Four candidates are in the race:
1)Kono Taro, the current minister for administrative reforms
2)Kishida Fumio, a former minister of foreign affairs
3)Takaichi Sanae, a former internal affairs minister

4)Noda Seiko, a former internal affairs minister
•  The race is very tight. Polls suggest that Kono is the most popular candidate with the public as he
is seen as more candid, straight-talking and a modernizer. However, polls among lawmakers show
that Kishida leads and he also won the support of LDP’s largest faction. On the other hand,
Takaichi has support from both former PM Abe and the powerful LDP secretary general Nikai.
•  Unless one candidate gets an outright majority in the first round, which involves both lawmakers
and LDP members, the second run-off round will be decided mostly by the lawmakers.
•  Once a winner is declared, the Diet is expected to formally elect the new prime minister on Oct. 4.

This makes an October general election very unlikely. Instead, it’s likely the current Diet session will
complete its full term on Oct. 21 and the general election will be held on Nov. 7 or Nov. 14.
•  The new PM is likely to announce their Cabinet also on Oct. 4.
•  The above scenario suggests that Japan’s team will attend the COP26 Climate Change Conference
in Glasgow (starting Nov. 1) on the eve of a general election, which would make them cautious
about accepting initiatives that could be interpreted as damaging to Japanese businesses.

•  The timing of the Cabinet formation and dissolution also suggests that the currently proposed
draft of the new Basic Energy Plan, which sets out the energy mix for 2030, is unlikely to undergo
notable changes.
•  In the run-up to the LDP leadership vote, nuclear discussions again took center stage, creating a
rift between Kono and the other three candidates. In part, this is because Kono himself has pushed
the conversation to energy, using his manifesto pledge and various debate platforms to talk up the

potential for green tech, and renewable energy in particular, to be a growth story for the overall
economy.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Nuclear power the hot topic in the LDP leadership race
(Energy Shift, Sept. 22)
o  The four candidates in the race to become next LDP leader shared their views on
renewable energy and nuclear power in a recent debate.

o  Kono said he’d progressively phase out nuclear power plants as they reached the end of
their service lives. Also, he’d work to shut down coal and oil-fired generation.
o  Kono wants a more distributed power grid with greater spare capacity to reduce the risk
of blackouts after earthquakes and other natural disasters.
o  Takaichi took an opposing position, arguing that nuclear power plants are essential to
ensure stable electricity supply. She advocated for small modular underground reactors,

as well as more research into nuclear fusion. Takaichi envisages a government-led
initiative to develop a commercially viable small modular fusion reactor.

o  Noda was also critical of Kono’s energy policy, saying stable electricity can’t be
guaranteed with renewables.
o  Kishida criticized Kono for his aim to end the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. Kishida said
that if Japan stopped reprocessing nuclear waste, it’d end up with a plutonium stockpile
that would cause diplomatic issues.

o  Kono replied that the Monju experimental fast breeder reactor was shut down in 2016
after a long string of technical problems and that the time had come for Japan to change
its official support for the nuclear ‘fuel cycle’.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Final days of campaign see presidential candidates discuss energy
(NHK, Sept. 25)
o  Kono: renewable energy is vital not only for electricity but as a way for the regions create
local employment and utilize what they generate locally.
o  Kishida: while we net-zero emissions by 2050 is important, we must also consider the
stability of power supplies and price.

o  Takaichi: we have to consider how to support the weaknesses of renewable energy and
ensure stable power supply.
o  Noda: when switching to new energy systems, we must consider mitigating drastic
changes such as in employment. I’d also like to support those who are working on
alternative energy sources.




METI publishes initial allocation from ¥2T Green Fund, with steel and ammonia in focus

(Japan NRG, Sept. 15)
•  METI is seeking applications for government funding of ¥193.5 billion for “green” steel and ¥68.8
billion for ammonia projects. The money will come from the ¥2 trillion Green Innovation Fund set
up this year to support decarbonization technologies.
•  METI is especially keen on iron ore reduction technologies that use hydrogen and re-use carbon
generated in the reduction process, so as to eliminate the need for carbon capture and storage.

The govt. is also interested in electric smelting tech to remove impurities from hot metal.
•  CONTEXT: Nippon Steel, JFE Steel and Kobe Steel, together with state research hub NEDO, are
working on such hydrogen reduction processes. Their tech is presently rated 4 out of 11 in terms of
readiness.
•  For ammonia, METI wants to support tech that can cut production costs by over 15%, as well as
tech that works in low temperature and pressure environments, and which doesn’t require
hydrogen as a raw material. Also, funding will go to makers of boilers and turbines that support co-

firing when ammonia is more than half of the fuel mix.
•  Fund applications close on Nov. 1 and winners will be announced in mid-December.
•  Distribution of an initial ¥500 billion will be as follows.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

METI modifies Green Innovation Fund rules
(Japan NRG, Sept. 17)
o  METI changed Green Innovation Fund rules to allow companies that receive financing to
make their own progress reports. Initially, METI wanted each beneficiary of state funds to
accept a NEDO official as a project manager.
o  NEDO, which acts as the secretariat for the ¥2 trillion fund, now faces staff shortages.

o  CONTEXT: The govt. has traditionally tried to make sure there’s strict compliance at firms
that receive state funds and punish those that misuse them, not only by withdrawing the
money but also by banning them from other state-backed projects.



Govt. announces four additional focus zones for offshore wind

(Kankyo Business, Sept. 14)
•  Four more areas have been classified as focus zones for the development of offshore wind power,
according to the announcements from the METI and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport
and Tourism.
•  Akita Prefecture’s Happo Town and Noshiro City are now designated as preferred promotional
areas for offshore wind. They will now formulate a public process to select operators for projects
within the promotional area.

•  Four new focus zones:
o  Oki, Katagami and Akita (Akita prefecture)
o  Yuza (Yamagata prefecture)
o  Murakami and Tainai (Niigata prefecture)
o  Izumi (Chiba prefecture)

•  CONTEXT: The three existing areas classified as promising for offshore wind are the Japan Sea
(north) side off the coast of Aomori prefecture, the Japan Sea (south) side off the coast of Aomori
prefecture, and Saikai city, the Eshima offshore zone, Nagasaki Prefecture.
•  To make the list of focus zones, a site needs to offer good environmental conditions, not interfere
with existing fishing or shipping operations, and have access to sufficient transmission capacity.

Getting a license to develop a project in the zones could give a business permit for up to 30 years.
•  The ministries said that a list of 10 further sites, including Shimamaki in Hokkaido and Karatsu in
Saga, may also be classified as ‘promising’ in the future, pending the identification of interested
parties and the establishment of transmission capacity.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan was expected to expand on its original focus areas for offshore wind. In fact, many
companies already started to pursue projects outside of the original zones banking of their future inclusion in

the government plans. Still, this is an important development. It will broaden the volume of projects in Japan’s
burgeoning offshore wind industry and also cushion the blow for the many firms that will lose out after winners
of the first round of offshore wind tenders are announced, likely within the next couple of months.



Govt. to raise trigger for solar’s environmental assessment to 50MW and more

(Nikkei, Sept. 14)
•  The govt. wants to raise the bar at which an environmental assessment is needed for a solar power
project from 10 MW to 50 MW. The change likely will be made this fiscal year.
•  Officials are concerned that too many municipalities have passed ordinances that make it difficult
to install or outright ban new solar projects. Almost a tenth of Japan’s municipalities have added
such rules.
•  MoE Minister Koizumi wants to reverse the trend of renewable energy facilities being seen as a

nuisance by municipalities, and will introduce a “promotion zone” concept for renewable energy
projects, which should be possible when the revised Global Warming Countermeasures Promotion
Law comes into effect in FY2022.
•  The MoE plans to exclude areas at risk of sediment-related disasters from such promotion zones.
•  Local governments are expected to take the lead on the realization of the “promotion zone”
concept by bringing together businesses and residents for discussion and overseeing the
formulation of a renewable energy plan for the community. The inclusive approach is less likely to

come unstuck from citizen protests.
•  MoE wants 1,000 such “promotion zones” nationwide by 2030, and expects they’ll allow the
installation of about 4.1 GW of solar capacity.
•  Some will likely be added via agro-solar sharing arrangements, where solar panels are added to
farmland. Adding energy generation to agricultural income is seen as an attractive business model.




Mitsubishi seeks to produce ammonia in U.S. for Japan export
(Nikkei, Sept. 21)
•  Mitsubishi Corp. will begin manufacturing ammonia in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the latter half of
the 2020s for export to Japan.

CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  The aim is to establish a production facility near the states of Louisiana and Texas with an annual
output of 1 million tons of ammonia, which would be sold to Japanese power utilities and
steelmakers for use as a fuel.
•  The CO2 generated in the production process is due to be sequestered or converted into
petrochemical products based on an agreement with U.S. energy company Denbury. Denbury uses

CO2 for enhanced oil recovery.
• TAKEAWAY: This is the third major project to manufacture ammonia overseas announced my Mitsubishi Corp
within the last six months or so. Earlier in the month, the trading house announced plans for a 1-million-ton
ammonia production hub in Canada. In March, it signed an MoU with Indonesia’s PT Panca Amara Utama
(PAU) which is expected to lead to a manufacturing center that will deliver up to 700,000 tons of ammonia.
These actions by Mitsubishi alone would bring 2.7 million tons of ammonia production online as soon as 2030,

close to the Japanese govt. target of securing 3 million tons of ammonia by the end of this decade.
• Mitsubishi is also involved in helping Saudi Aramco bring test deliveries of blue ammonia to Japan.

• Given than Mitsubishi is far from the only company seeking to establish the global ammonia supply chain that
connects to Japan, it will be interesting to see how much total volumes the Japanese investments will
generate. At face value, it looks as if the capacities being planned are far beyond the currently expected
demand scenario. This indicates either that the supply side projects are yet to be filtered out, or that the
demand picture is being underestimated.



METI panel urges incentives to use carbon-absorbed concrete

(Japan NRG, Sept. 13)
•  METI panel experts considering carbon recycling also suggest the launch of new schemes that
allow users of carbon-absorbed concrete to receive offset credits.
•  The cement industry produces 31 million tons of CO2 emissions a year, one of the top emitters
after steel and chemicals. Japan’s top cement makers are working on developing a new type of
concrete that absorbs carbon.
•  This new concrete was first used last year by a consortium of Kajima, Chugoku Electric, Denka and

Landes. The material went into construction of solar power plants for Chugoku Electric and
condominiums in Tokyo.
•  New companies such as Tokyo Gas are entering the sector. However, experts believe that further
incentives are needed to popularize the use of new concrete. These could come in the form of
offset credits and mechanisms that prevent carbon leakage.
•  METI experts also suggested that the government start using the material for public buildings. So
far, it has only been used in private projects.



Energy ministers from ASEAN, greater Asia meet online to talk gas storage, climate
(Japan NRG, Sept. 16)
•  Energy ministers from ASEAN + 3 met online to share information on policies and the best

practices of oil and gas stockpiling, as well as climate change mitigation.
•  METI deputy minister, Ejima, attended the summit that included ASEAN countries, as well as
China, South Korea, the U.S., India, Russia, Australia and New Zealand.

•  CONTEXT: Japan has little gas storage, and all of it is short-term (max. 2-3 weeks). The
government is pursuing the practice of alliance-building with regional neighbors in the hope of
setting up gas stockpile hubs across Asia, which would also export opportunities for Japanese
makers of gas tanks and other stockpile facilities.




ENEOS repurposes oil refineries to convert plastic to petrochemicals
(Nikkei Business, Sept. 21)
•  In collaboration with UK-based Mura Technology, ENEOS and Mitsubishi Chemical are

repurposing oil refineries to enable them to break down plastic waste using supercritical steam.
•  The process produces high-quality recycled oil with low levels of impurities.
•  The process can help put Japan’s surplus oil refinery capacity to good use.




Hitachi Zosen to issue ¥10 billion in green bonds
(Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun News Wave 21, Sept. 12)
•  Hitachi Zosen is preparing to offer a green bond issue worth ¥10 billion. The five-year bonds will
go on sale in October. Funds raised will be invested in a wind farm being built in the Mutsu-
Ogawara region (Aomori) by ENEOS and Itochu Corporation.
•  The 57 MW wind farm is scheduled to begin feeding the grid as early as 2024, and will be
operated and maintained by Hitachi Zosen.




Meidensha trials AI-controlled smart hydropower plant system

(Kankyo Business, Sept. 16)
•  Tokyo-based Meidensha was selected by Nagano Prefecture to design and trial an AI-based
system to control hydropower stations.
•  By analyzing historical data on rainfall and dam levels, the system will be trained to accurately
predict future dam levels.
•  More accurate modeling will enable power plant output to be maximized while ensuring hydro lake
levels do not fall too low.



COSMO  to bundle renewable energy services with electric vehicles
(Kankyo Business, Sept. 16)
•  COSMO Oil Marketing launched a new service for local bodies to purchase carbon neutral
electricity, EVs and related services in a single package.
•  The “COSMO Zero Carbon Solution” includes lease and ownership options for installing PV

panels, and leasing and car share services for EVs.
•  COSMO Oil Marketing will offer more competitive prices by bundling new and existing services.

Iwatani, Kawasaki in Australia hydrogen project
(New Energy Business News, Sept. 17)
•  Iwatani, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, KEPCO and Marubeni signed a MoU with Australia-based

Stanwell and APT Management Services for a feasibility study for a hydrogen plant in Queensland
that would synthesize hydrogen at commercial scale from renewably generated electricity for
shipping to Japan in liquid form.
•  If the project goes ahead, output is projected to reach at least 100 metric tons per day by 2026,
and 800 tons a day by 2031.
•  The plant would ultimately consume over seven gigawatts of electricity.




Yamanashi hydrogen business no longer just about solar power
(Sankei Shimbun, Sept. 23)
•  Yamanashi has long been associated with solar energy.
•  Recently, the prefecture also began investing in ‘power to gas’ technology that uses electricity

from renewable sources to synthesize and liquefy hydrogen for use as fuel.
•  A partnership between the prefectural government, Toray, Hitachi Zosen, and other stakeholders
uses a polymer electrolyte membrane process to produce hydrogen from renewably generated
electricity - hydroelectric, wind and geothermal sources, in addition to power generated by solar
farms.
•  While the operation is still a small proof of concept system, the partners are working on a

commercial system that generates 10 times more hydrogen.
•  The hydrogen yielded is seen as an energy source for fuel cells and boilers.



Tokuyama and Panasonic run fuel cells on hydrogen byproducts

(New Energy Business News, Sept. 16)
•  In conjunction with Panasonic, chemical manufacturer Tokuyama is trialing an initiative in which
hydrogen gas generated as a byproduct of processes performed in Tokuyama’s Yamaguchi factory
is used to run fuel cells.
•  The hydrogen, which is produced as a byproduct of the manufacture of caustic soda by the
electrolysis of brine using the ion exchange membrane process, will power up to six 700W fuel

cells.
•  Electricity generated can be used to supplement the factory’s requirements.
•  The trial will run until March 2023.


Toshiba consortium awarded CCUS supply chain contract

(New Energy Business News, Sept. 14)
•  MoE will fund a consortium comprising Toshiba and 12 other companies to research the
establishment of an environmentally friendly carbon capture utilization and storage supply chain.
•  The project aims to assess the feasibility of CO2 transportation and storage and improve
understanding of related technologies.

Japan’s biggest shipper and BP join forces to decarbonization marine fuels
(Company Statements, Sept. 15)
•  NYK and BP signed an MoU on decarbonization to promote a transition from traditional marine
fuels to alternatives such as LNG, biofuels and methanol and to provide future zero-emission

energy sources such as ammonia and hydrogen.
•  In addition, the two companies will support other industries that are difficult to decarbonize by
providing sea transportation of CO2 and other solutions, and will also seek to participate in the
supply chain of ammonia and hydrogen used in heavy industry and power generation.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

(Denki Shimbun, Sept. 24)
o  NYK Line will invest in Australian Integrated Carbon (AIC), a company involved in a
primeval forest restoration project and the sale of carbon credits.
o  The Japanese shipper plans to acquire business know-how regarding carbon credit
creation and study how to offset CO2 emissions.
o  NYK formed a JV with Mitsubishi Corporation, called Japan Integrated Carbon (JIC), to
make the investment in AIC. Mitsubishi owns 60% of the JV and NYK the rest. The

venture will own 40% of AIC shares.
o  AIC helps farmers improve pasture management in order to regenerate primeval forest
lost to overgrazing. The improvement will be certified as carbon credits by the Australian
government.

All regional power utilities to increase tariffs in November
(Shikoku News, Sept. 16)
•  Japan’s 10 major electricity suppliers will raise tariffs in November, amid rising LNG and coal costs.
•  Okinawa Electric will register the biggest increase, as subscribers see monthly bills rise an average
of ¥171. The next biggest are Chugoku Electric, TEPCO, and Chubu Electric.
• TAKEAWAY: Rising energy raw materials prices, and as a consequence rising electricity prices, is a global issue

and Japan is no exception. The rally in natural gas prices around the world is starting to filter through into the
domestic power costs and may mean the winter price peak will come earlier than normal and even without any
capacity shortages.
• Japan already has one of the highest electricity prices in the world, while the cost of procuring green electricity

locally often comes at a premium. As such, this winter will be a test for corporate commitment to decarbonize
in the face of rising prices.



Nuclear power no longer that cheap: Opinion

(Nikkei Shimbun, Sept. 22)
•  CONTEXT: This text was published as part of a recently launched daily “Deep Truth” column in
Nikkei that attempts to give an analytical take.
•  The author states that while latest govt. figures claim electricity from nuclear power plants will cost
¥11.7 per kw/ hour in 2030, putting it on par with wind, rising plant construction costs could mean
this figure will be closer to ¥20.
•  Govt. projections are based on a construction cost of ¥400,000 per kw/ hour, a figure that predates
the Fukushima disaster.

•  In fact, recent projects to construct nuclear plants in France, the UK and the U.S. have resulted in
costs of over ¥1 million per kilowatt hour.
• TAKEAWAY: That Nikkei, Japan’s top business daily, criticized nuclear power is a major change from even a
couple of years ago. Nikkei has traditionally supported positions held by Keidanren (Japan’s top lobby group
for big business) and the latter remains a stout backer of nuclear power.

• Ignoring for a moment the thorny issue of estimating the true cost of any one energy source, it will be
interesting to see if Nikkei’s new stance on nuclear survives the current PM leadership contest. The newspaper
has been rather favorable towards top candidate Kono Taro, a major nuclear critic. Other candidates, however,
are more favorable towards nuclear.

•  The research team envisages a scheme whereby EVs are relocated to parts of the grid with
insufficient electricity reserves so their batteries can provide additional power.




Kashiwazaki-Kariwa investigation uncovers negligent TEPCO culture
(Tokyo Shimbun, Sept. 23)
•  An investigation into breaches at TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant reveals a slack culture
and the company’s inability to police itself.
•  Ironically, the heavy financial losses sustained after the Fukushima disaster encouraged TEPCO to
cut expenditure on mandatory anti-terrorist measures, the probe found.
•  The resulting staff reductions and cost cuts spawned a culture of stopgap workarounds for

equipment malfunctions rather than following protocol.
•  The culture of complacency seems endemic to TEPCO’s nuclear division, which repeatedly ignored
internal audit findings that criticized delays in rectifying sensor malfunctions.
•  At the time, TEPCO’s executive was not informed of the breaches.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Ongoing scandals at TEPCO cast doubts on government’s nuclear policy

(Asahi Shimbun, Sept. 23)
o  The latest compliance breaches at TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant has
people asking why the utility didn’t learn from the Fukushima disaster.
o  TEPCO Chair Kobayashi apologized and said if improvements aren’t made, the company
will be seen as unfit to run nuclear plants.
o  Kobayashi said he’s well aware this is TEPCO’s last chance to make good.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

• TAKEAWAY: The bad news for TEPCO, especially and most damagingly from its nuclear division, continues
and even grows. Whether the company survives in its current form will depend largely on who is the next
prime minister. However, as new chairman Kobayashi said, the company has exhausted its “second chances”.
Odds are high that the TEPCO group will undergo a major restructuring, as soon as next year.




NUCLEAR REACTOR NEWS ROUND-UP:
Restart of Ikata nuclear plant in October now expected to be delay due to scandal
(Yomiuri Shimbun, Sept.12)
o  CONTEXT: The Ikata NPP owner (Shikoku) received a warning from the NRA after one of

its plant operators left his post several times while on standby duty. The post is supposed
to be manned continuously.
o  Shikoku Electric submitted a report to the governor of Ikata city regarding the scandal
around its staff. The local governor will review the report.
o  This will delay the plant’s restart that’s scheduled for Oct. 12. The utility had already
started to load fuel into the reactor.
o  Shikoku’s report confirmed that its now former staff had left their post while on duty,

clarifying this was done 46 times from 2016 to 2020.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Governor considers 20-year extension for Kyushu’s Sendai NPP
(MBC News, Sept. 21)
o  Governor Shioda of Kagoshima prefecture is in talks with the Japan Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC) and industry experts around a potential 20-year extension of the

operating license for Sendai NPP (Kyushu) Units 1 and 2.
o  The facilities will reach their 40-year license limit in 2024 and 2025.
o  In April, Kyushu Electric said it would apply for the 20-year permit extension for the

o  Around 100 fire alarms at TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant were
installed in the wrong place and don’t comply with regulations.
o  Heat and smoke alarms were installed too close to ventilation ducts; thus, in case of a
fire, the emergency response might be delayed.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Failure of Fukushima filters went unchecked
(Kyodo, Sept. 9)
o  An inspection of exhaust gas filters in an advanced liquid processing system (ALPS) used
to remove radioactive material from waste water at the site of the Fukushima nuclear
disaster found that all but one of the 25 glass fiber filters had failed.
o  Shockingly, a similar failure was found at an inspection two years earlier, but TEPCO

neither publicized the matter nor tried to identify the cause.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Nuclear operators vexed at government’s lack of support
(Nikkei Business, Sept. 10)
o  Like many Japanese nuclear power plants, Hamaoka NPP (Chubu) has not generated
electricity for over 10 years. As staff retire, the NPP is losing workers with experience of

operating a reactor.
o  The plant even resorted to sending staff to visit a nearby thermal power station to
experience the noise, heat and vibration of a working station.
o  Japanese nuclear plant operators are unhappy with the govt’s proposed basic energy
policy, claiming it doesn’t show commitment to nuclear energy or offer alternative energy
sources as a baseload capacity.
o  Industry experts say the tougher compliance standards that followed the Fukushima

disaster make it almost impossible to pass inspections, which they say is demoralizing.



Chubu Electric gets nervous about green subsidiary’s “shady deal”
(Senkaku, September 2021 edition)
•  Protest is heating up against the construction of a large solar power plant in Kannami Town,
Shizuoka prefecture. The developer is Toenec Corp, a subsidiary of Chubu Electric. The area for

the project is close to the site of the deadly landslide in Atami city earlier this year.
•  Citizens of Kannami claim Toenec hasn’t provided sufficient safety measures or disclosed adequate
information about the project. Locals are concerned that a similar landslide might occur in their
area, and even took the matter to Chubu Electric at its latest AGM.
•  The project was originally planned by a South Korean developer, Blue Capital Management, which
is rumored to have been involved in the scandal around former MoE head, Akimoto Tsukasa.
•  Chubu Electric’s Toenec is keen to expand in solar and has acquired projects in Oita prefecture

and around Sendai. But the parent firm is concerned that its subsidiary may have walked in on a
“shady deal” with the Kannami project and it governance issues come up, Chubu Electric will have
to take responsibility.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE


Japanese Firms Rush to Set Their Own Carbon Prices;
Results Show Huge Variance in Opinion and Methodology

Japan is an internal carbon pricing (ICP) enthusiast. Of the 864 companies worldwide
that used an ICP system last year to set an internal value for one ton of CO2, 118 were
from Japan. That ranked Japan second only to the U.S. in the ICP rollout.

While Japanese firms have rushed to put a monetary figure on CO2 emissions, a
Japan NRG survey shows a vast difference in methodology and outlook. In fact, the
answers collected from public reports and conversations with over 30 companies and
industry associations varied in their pricing by a factor of 1,000.

As nations prepare for November’s COP26 meeting in Glasgow, at which at least one
global carbon pricing and trading scheme is expected to be announced, the wild
variations in Japanese ICPs suggest that the prospects of CO2 becoming a broadly
accepted and traded commodity is still at an early, formative stage. What one ton of
CO2 represents for each company and industry differs greatly, and cost assumptions
reflect this.

Still, our findings suggest that ICP, as it is today, is seen by many firms as a financial
adjustment that must be included in risk calculations due to expected disruptions in
supply and demand balances and marketplace rules during the energy transition.


The price is right?
The purpose of ICP is to measure the impact of carbon costs on capital and
investments. When CO2 is understood to be a quantifiable risk with a monetary value,
companies can change their operations, strategy, capital allocation and so on, to
justify action as business-critical.

An ICP is used separately from a government-set tax on carbon emissions and doesn’t
result in any fines or payments. However, it encourages businesses to make changes
based on expectations of updates in the environment and market conditions that
could lead to penalties for emissions.

Japan NRG carried out a survey of the leading Japanese companies to have engaged
with ICP. The results showed the following:

•  The approach to ICP calculations at Japanese firms vary based on how they plan to
achieve net zero emissions. Carbon offsets; a total or partial shift to renewable power;
plans for energy efficiency such as recycling of waste heat; a shift to low-impact fuels –
all these and other decarbonization roadmaps tend to produce different pricing for a
ton of CO2.
•  Several firms said their understanding of ICP methodologies is still evolving and, as
such, the current approach is either overhauled or temporarily suspended.
•  The internal carbon price set by those surveyed ranged between ¥920/ ton of CO2
and ¥100,000.

| Results Show Huge Variance in Opinion and Methodology |

•  The median price points were ¥5,640/ ton and ¥6,000/ ton. The medium or average
was ¥12,359/ ton. This shows that while there were a few exceptionally high ICP
levels, about half of the companies set a carbon price of around $50/ ton. That
compares with the 60 euros (~$70 level) recently reached by exchange-traded carbon
prices in the EU.
•  All companies, bar one, used a single carbon price and applied it to all their divisions
and global operations. The exception was paper maker Oji Holdings, with two internal
prices.
•  Companies used three ICP calculation methodologies, with the number of
respondents evenly spread across them: shadow pricing based on public indices;
implicit pricing based on the cost of cutting emissions; and, an internal fee based on
other cost models.
•  For shadow pricing, the firms surveyed mostly relied on the European Emissions
Trading Scheme (EU ETS), IEA price forecasts, local greenhouse tax rate forecasts, and
the ICP of peers.
•  For internal carbon costs, most firms counted taxes, thermal and renewable electricity
rates, and the expense of offset credits as inputs. Past records on energy system
upgrades were also used.

Reaching for the advanced stars
Japan’s biggest ICP-setter for years is Astellas Pharma, which uses the figure for stress
tests. The firm says its ¥100,000/ ton level is based on the cost of building and
running a “green” production plant in Ireland, a country that had the most advanced
carbon regulations among Astellas’ global operations. The staggeringly high price is
seen as a “fair reflection” of Japanese realities, and at present, that’s the rough cost
of switching the firm’s power supplies from a thermal generator to wind farms, the
official said, citing MoE data.

While the company hasn’t yet made its own in-depth analysis of Japan’s power and
CO2 costs, Japanese ministry data was in line with Astellas' figures for its Irish plant.

Runner-up Hitachi Capital Corporation said its ICP is based on shadow pricing and
internal fees, while third-placed Sagawa Express said its ¥35,000/ ton estimate reflects
the cost of switching from electricity delivered by thermal generation to solar power.
Sagawa, one of Japan’s top logistics firms, mostly uses diesel fuel for delivery trucks,
but it’s shifting the fleet to EVs.

The lowest ICP value among respondents came from Kokuyo, a maker of office
stationery, which bases its figure on the cost of deforestation, which has declined
since 2017.

TEPCO had the second-lowest ICP of respondents, claiming its figure is based on the
government-set model for utilities joining tenders to win compensation for building or
replacing thermal power capacity. TEPCO has maintained an ICP at the same level
since 2018.

Several firms took their ICP cue from the European ETS market, including materials
maker Toray and chemicals major Teijin, which also blended the EU numbers with the
ICP of global peers and carbon tax rates across several jurisdictions.

The Hitachi Group showcased how diverse ICP can be within a conglomerate despite
the use of third-party data and shadow pricing. Hitachi Ltd. recently raised its ICP to
¥14,000 by combining EU ETS data with domestic greenhouse tax rates. Hitachi
Capital Corp, combined third-party data and internal cost assumptions to come up
with a figure almost six times higher. Meanwhile, Hitachi Construction Machinery set
its ICP at ¥5,000.

Basing ICPs on EU ETS data has meant frequently updating the ICP as the price of the
underlying benchmark has rapidly increased. For exactly this reason, shipper NYK now
reviews its ICP twice a year rather than once, said a company official. Hitachi Ltd.’s
carbon value has almost tripled in two years. Similarly, lower ICPs tend to be at
companies that review calculations less often.

Not all ICP methodologies reviewed by Japan NRG make sense, at least at first
glance. The Japan Iron and Steel Federation picked an ICP of ¥4,000 based on energy
costs and greenhouse gas taxes. Given the energy-intensive nature of steelmaking,
which also tops Japan’s rankings of emitters, the value seems low, especially in
comparison with the ICPs of less energy-intensive manufacturers.

Creative ICP approaches
Service and trading firms seem to have opted for a more creative approach to
evaluating carbon costs. Educational services provider Benesse Holdings used to
analyze the environmental impact of customers traveling to its events, though the
company says it has currently suspended ICP calculations.

Trading house Toyota Tsusho expresses ICP as a monthly fee of ¥110/ seat occupied
by an office employee. The number represents what it would cost to offset the ¥530
million annual spending on electricity for its offices with carbon credits.

Meanwhile, Fujitsu sets an “internal tax” of ¥1,000/ ton for business units that don’t
meet carbon reduction targets.


Integration of government schemes?
In 2020, 134 Japanese companies told non-profit organization CDP that they’ll
introduce an ICP, which suggests carbon accounting will become a bigger part of day-
to-day operations for in the country.

How ICPs will work with government-mandated carbon credits and trading schemes is
less clear. METI plans to launch Japan’s first nationwide carbon exchange next year,
which in theory could serve as the go-to benchmark for domestic firms in their ICP
calculations. However, some firms that spoke with Japan NRG don’t plan to integrate
their CO2 calculations with the domestic exchange, preferring instead to factor in
international trends.

The diversity of methodology is likely to be another barrier for Japan, as well as other
nations, in moving businesses over to accounting that factors in CO2 costs. Rather
than setting up an exchange to trade CO2 certificates, the government could bring
more benefit to the country’s business sector by first setting uniform rules for
valuations.

The Decarbonization Wager;

How Japan May Lose Control of its LNG Prowess
For decades Japan has been the biggest, most dominant buyer in the LNG market,
holding sway over one of the world’s top energy markets. This summer brought two
significant developments that threaten to change Japan’s role and influence.

While Japan imported a world-leading 107 billion cubic meters of LNG in 20201,
China’s demand growth saw it surpass both Japan and South Korea over the first six
months of 2021. China’s demand for LNG is expected to continue rising.
The second factor was generated by Japan. In late July, METI released a draft of the
6th Basic Energy Plan. Its vision for the 2030 electricity mix has renewable energy
climbing to almost 40% of total at the expense of fossil fuels. With nuclear’s ratio
maintained at around 20%, the allocation for gas, coal and oil is squeezed to 41%.

This will have significant impact on Japan’s future LNG contracts, and buyer strategy
will also need to carefully consider China’s gas purchases and structure.


The end of an era
Currently, Japanese buyers rely heavily on long-term LNG contracts to source natural
gas. However, 56% of these contracts will expire within the next decade.

While buyers have the choice to extend or renegotiate their contracts, the strong
government policy signals to reduce fossil fuels, plus more regional competition for
LNG, is creating uncertainty for Japanese buyers when reconsidering long-term
purchasing strategy.
Our analysis shows there are two specific factors that will drive the strategy of
Japanese LNG buyers: 1) the pace of decarbonization in both China and Japan, and
its correlation with natural gas demand; and 2) the possible introduction of a second
gas pipeline from Russia to China.
The first is far from a straightforward assumption that installing more renewable
energy power plants will eat into gas purchase volumes. Indeed, both Japan and
China face much uncertainty over the extent of decarbonization over the next 15-20
years. Hence, we propose an alternative, “advanced technology scenario,” in which
domestic natural gas demand is reduced in case of accelerated decarbonization in
between 2021-2035.

Figures 1 and 2 below show the demand assumptions for China and Japan based on
our reference scenario, which assumes an annual growth rate for China at 4% and
unchanged for Japan, and the advanced technology scenario. The latter assumes
China transitions from fossil fuels at a quicker pace and that demand for natural gas
averages +3% between 2021-2035. For Japan, the same advanced technology case

sees annual demand shrink by 3%, driven largely by a reduction in gas use for
electricity.

The second factor mentioned earlier is the potential for China to add more pipeline
capacity, which would potentially shrink its LNG demand and influence the purchasing
of other Asian buyers. The main candidate is the “Power of Siberia 2” (PS2) pipeline
proposed by Russia to run via Mongolia, carrying as much as 50 billion cubic meters
(bcm) per year.

Figure 3 below demonstrates the effect of a substantial reduction in gas demand in
China and Japan on LNG imports into Asia in total. In aggregate, the advanced
technology scenario results in a 103 billion cubic meter reduction in LNG demand for
the entire East Asia region including China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, and a $2/
mmbtu reduction in Asian LNG price through 2035, shown in Figure 6 below.

Figure 5: Japan LNG Imports: Base Case vs. Adv Tech Case












Pipeline impact on LNG imports
In both our reference and advanced technology scenarios, by 2035 more than 45 bcm
of gas would be delivered to China via PS2, at a near 100% utilization rate. This means
if demand is within a certain range, the efficiency of this project won’t be impacted.
That also indicates that LNG would play the role of marginal supplier to China and
pipeline gas would be the core source of imports.

The PS2 project holds attraction for China in several ways. It allows for flexibility of
supply and a degree of control over price.
In a world without PS2, China would require an additional 47 bcm of LNG imports,
making the Asian LNG market more aligned with Chinese demand growth trajectories.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

In effect, this would lead to an increase in Asian LNG prices of $1.30/ mmbtu in our
reference case and $0.70/ mmbtu in the advanced technology scenario.

As you can see from the price modeling, it is to China’s advantage to negotiate with
Russia for the construction of the PS2 pipeline. Whether they succeed or not will have
a further impact on other Asian buyers, especially Japan.

In the situation where China has no additional Russia pipeline import volumes, there is
a negative impact on Japanese imports due to there being more competition for LNG
cargoes. Although we see Japan’s natural gas demand decline in all possible
scenarios, our reference case assumes a small decline of less than 1% between 2020
and 2035 and about 2% in the advanced technology case.

GLOBAL       VIEW

B Y JOHN VAROLI

Below are some of last week’s most important international energy developments monitored by the Japan
NRG team because of their potential to impact energy supply and demand, as well as prices. We see the
following as relevant to Japanese and international energy investors.

Auto Industry – green steel
Germany’s Mercedes-Benz said it wants all of its new cars to be "carbon neutral"
across its value chain by 2039. Mercedes will work in partnership with Swedish
steelmaker SSAB to source fossil-fuel-free metal. SSAB has developed a steelmaking
process that uses (green) hydrogen rather than coking coal. SSAB’s partners in the
hydrogen ironmaking tech are the miner LKAB and Swedish energy firm Vattenfall.


China – energy efficiency
Beijing is cracking down on energy-intensive projects after 20 of the country’s 30
regions failed to meet their energy consumption targets. The National Development
and Reform Commission (NDRC) said local officials must limit absolute energy use and
cut the amount of energy used per unit of GDP. However, highly important national
projects will remain exempt from local energy consumption controls.


Coal – China’s overseas exit
Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to end the financing of new coal power plants
overseas. However, China will continue to support coal use at home. The country
accounts for most new coal projects around the world and coal is the dominant fuel in
its electricity mix. During the first half of 2021, China announced dozens of new coal-
fired power and steel plants, which if realized would add 150 million tons in annual
CO2 emissions, according to Global Energy Monitor.


Green finance – UK green bonds and Gates’ new fund
1) The UK’s inaugural “green gilt” sale saw record demand as investors lined up to buy
the 12-year government bond aimed at raising funds for environmental spending. The
bond, due in 2033 with a yield of 0.87%, raised £10 billion for the government and is
the largest sovereign green bond. More than £100 billion of bids were placed — the
highest ever for a UK government bond sale. The UK plans to sell at least £15 billion
of green gilts this year to channel money to projects including flood defense,
renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage.

2) With strong support from BlackRock Inc. and Microsoft Corp, billionaire Bill Gates’
innovation fund, Breakthrough Energy Catalyst (BEC), has raised more than $1 billion
to support clean-energy projects. BlackRock made a five-year, $100 million grant from
its charitable foundation, while Microsoft is chipping in another $100 million. Other
major supporters include General Motors, Bank of America, and ArcelorMittal, which
will contribute in the form of equity capital and offtakes, as well as purchase
agreements related to projects. BEC focuses on green solutions: battery storage,
carbon capture, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel.

LNG / natural gas – price spike
Citigroup more than doubled its Asian and European natural gas forecasts for next
quarter and said prices could surge to as high as $100 per mmbtu in the event of a
cold winter. LNG prices are skyrocketing due to seasonally low European inventories,
booming Chinese demand and supply constraints from Russia and Nigeria. LNG’s
Japan-Korea Marker (JKM) jumped almost 50% this month to near $30 per mmbtu. In
Europe, LNG is up around 40% at close to $25. U.S. gas prices have so far been more
subdued in terms of increases.


Oil – Shell exits Permian
Royal Dutch Shell will sell its Permian Basin oilfield, the largest in the U.S., to
ConocoPhillips for $9.5 billion in cash. The Permian Basin has been one of Shell’s core
oil and gas-producing regions, but the company has been facing intense pressure at
home to accelerate its exit from fossil fuels. In May, a court in the Netherlands
ordered the company to slash net carbon pollution by 45 per cent compared with
2019 levels. ConocoPhillips intends to use the purchase to deepen its push into the
American southwest deposits.


Russia – gas supply
The IEA called on Russia to supply more gas to the EU in order to alleviate the energy
crisis. Traders and officials in European countries that are often antagonistic to Russia
have claimed that Moscow is restricting supplies. They question why Russia’s natural
gas giant, Gazprom, has limited top-up sales in the spot market to Europe. Gazprom
has also unsettled markets by keeping its underground storage facilities in Europe
stocked at low levels compared with previous years.


UK – energy crisis
The country’s remaining coal power stations will be paid large sums to continue
operating after one of the least windy summers on record locally sparked a jump in
energy prices. While the UK has slashed coal-generated power in recent years, the
few coal plants that remain are held on standby. The price of UK electricity during the
past week’s peak hours reached a record of £1,750 per MWh, which is 2,900% higher
than the average for the last decade. Seven local gas and electricity firms have now
gone bankrupt in recent weeks due to the price spike.


U.S. - batteries
Battery recycler Redwood Materials Inc. is searching for a site in the U.S. to build a $1
billion battery-component plant, according to CEO JB Straubel, who was a Tesla Inc.
co-founder. The move will make Redwood a major U.S. producer of cathodes that are
used in EV batteries. Redwood’s new U.S. factory will produce material for 100
gigawatt hours of batteries annually by the end of 2025, which could help equip 1.3
million EVs a year. By 2030, the Redwood facility plans to rev up that figure to 500
gigawatt hours per year.
