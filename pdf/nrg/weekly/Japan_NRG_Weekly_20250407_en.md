NEWS:    GENERAL      POLICY    AND   TRENDS


OCCTO  completes and publishes FY2025 Supply Plan Report

(Agency statement, March 28)
•  OCCTO published the “FY2025 Supply Plan” as part of its 2025 Annual Report.
•  The report was sent to the METI Minister with the following opinions:
o  Data center demand and coal power-fired plant shutdowns may tighten the mid-to-long-term
supply-demand balance, requiring more policies to ensure both decarbonization and stable
power supply.
o  Aging facilities, work style reforms, and an increase in startup/ shutdown frequency have
prolonged the repair periods for power stations, impacting the supply-demand balance. It is
necessary to consider securing additional power capacity and the cost burdens that come
with that.
o  With regard to grid development to meet large demand, it is necessary to consider fair cost
sharing among market participants and review the rules for getting connected to the grid.
•  CONTEXT: OCCTO annual reports also include: “Overview of Electricity Supply-Demand and Power
Grids”; “Electricity Quality”; “Information on Grid Access Services for Power Generation Facilities”;
“Results of Required Amount of Regulating Power and Confirmation of Securing Status”. Only the Supply
Plan and a Research Study (Reviewing Overseas Simultaneous Markets) are published.



GHG emissions from major emitters fell in FY2022
(Government statement, April 1)
•  Total reported GHG emissions from large emitters dropped 4.4% to 586 Mt of CO2 in FY2022, down
from 613 Mt the previous year.
•  Large industrial and commercial sites contributed 559 Mt, which adjusts to 530 Mt after accounting
for domestic emission reductions and alternative fuels.
•  Major transport operators accounted for 26.95 Mt of emissions, a slight increase from 25.62 Mt a year
earlier.
•  CONTEXT: The data, covering 12,044 businesses and 1,335 transport operators, is mandated by the Act
on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures and aims to encourage transparency and voluntary
emission reductions among polluters.



Moving data centers to Hokkaido could save up to ¥9.4 bln

(Denki Shimbun, April 3)
•  Mitsubishi Research Institute (MRI) estimates that relocating data centers to Hokkaido could generate
economic benefits of ¥4.4 to ¥9.4 billion by reducing renewable energy curtailment and fossil fuel
consumption.
•  Under a scenario where data center-driven electricity demand in Hokkaido rises from 28.2 TWh in
FY2023 to 40–55 TWh by 2040, higher demand would reduce renewable curtailment and CO2
emissions, MRI argues.
•  Improved renewable utilization could increase annual revenue by ¥400 to ¥900 million for a 500 MW
wind power project.
•  Although lower land costs attract data center operators to rural areas, additional incentives – such as
discounted electricity rates – are essential to encourage regional investments due to shorter data

NEWS:    ELECTRICITY       MARKETS


ANRE reports on electricity supply-demand this winter

(Government statement, Mar 31)
•  ANRE reported on the electricity supply-demand this past winter, as well as the outlook for FY2025.
•  In winter FY2024, except for some days in March, power demand didn’t exceed the level expected
during a once-in-a-decade cold wave. Demand was similar to last winter in December, higher in early
January, and high in February. In March, it was considered to be at a low level compared to the once-
in-a-decade benchmark.
•  For the summer of FY2025, all areas of Japan are expected to be able to maintain a 3% reserve
margin. However, due to risks such as extreme weather, international fuel supply problems, and the
concentration of thermal power plants along the Tokyo Bay and Pacific coast, the power supply-
demand situation remains uncertain.
•  Future plans include refining monthly supply-demand forecasts and reviewing the coordination of
power plant retirements.
• TAKEAWAY: OCCTO completed the FY2025 supply plan after receiving input from all the major generators. Based
on that, the power supply-demand outlook for summer and winter 2025 shows that all areas are expected to
maintain the minimum required 3% reserve margin, even under severe weather conditions (i.e. once-in-a-decade
cold or heat). This should add stability to power prices, although unplanned shutdowns due to weather and
technical issues are on the increase. The level of caution by the govt will be judged based on whether they issue a
power conservation warning this summer or not.



TOCOM  electricity futures trading hits record in March
(Exchange statement, April 2)
•  The TOCOM exchange said electricity futures trading in March saw 12,600 contracts change hands,
easily surpassing the previous high of 4,853 contracts in May 2022.
•  CONTEXT: This translates into 901 GWh of volume, more than three times that of May 2022. The
exchange has attributed the increase in liquidity to the introduction of marketmakers and the entry of the

nation’s major banks into the market.
•  During the first three months of this year, futures trading on the TOCOM platform has already
surpassed the volume for the entire 2024, when 14,969 contracts were sold, representing a little over
2 TWh of electricity.
•  The most popular power futures contract by far is for East Area Baseload.

Spot power market demand rises in Feb due to cold snaps
(Denki Shimbun, April 3)
•  Daily average purchase bids on the JEPX spot market rose 8.7% MoM to 1.09 TWh in February, driven
by two severe cold snaps that boosted electricity demand.
•  Daily average sell offers fell slightly by 2.5% to 1.28 TWh, but ample supply – supported by restarted
nuclear power plants – prevented tight market conditions.
•  Total monthly purchase volume declined by 1.8% to 30.4 TWh, while sell volume dropped 11.9% to
35.9 TWh. Demand was particularly high in early February.
•  CONTEXT: The February trend was followed by weakening demand in March. While not all data is
available, the average day-ahead 24-hour spot price for March was ¥11.31/ kWh, down 18.8% from
February (¥13.94).



Japan doubles price cap for backup power auctions after initial failure

(Government statement, April 1)
•  Since the first auction attracted no bids, METI will raise the maximum bid price for backup power
capacity auctions to ¥14,399/ kW, more than double the initial ¥6,429.
•  CONTEXT: This market pays utilities to maintain power plants on standby so that these can be called
upon in case of emergency.
•  The new cap reflects feedback from power generators who said the original cap was insufficient to
cover repair and maintenance costs, thereby discouraging bids.
•  METI carefully set the revised cap based on the average upper limit of previous capacity market
auctions (FY2020–24) to ensure incentives remain balanced between the capacity and backup
markets. This prevents operational power plants from shifting to backup status solely for higher fees.
•  The second auction, covering FY2026–27, is scheduled to begin in summer 2025, with separate
bidding for eastern and western regions.
•  METI also confirmed plans for a comprehensive review of the capacity market beginning FY2025,
which could lead to adjustments in future backup power pricing depending on market response.

OCCTO  to tighten penalties in capacity market

(Organization statement, March 28)
•  OCCTO will tighten economic penalties in the capacity market starting FY2025 for failing to meet
requirements to supply electricity to wholesale power exchanges, etc.
•  OCCTO will increase the annual assumed duration of capacity commitment notices from the current
30 hours to 90 hours, reflecting actual conditions where notices frequently exceeded initial
assumptions. For example, in FY2024, capacity notices averaged 106 hours nationwide due to
unusual weather conditions.
•  The stricter calculation method will be applied retroactively to the main capacity market auctions held
between FY2021 and FY2024 (covering electricity supply from FY2025 to FY2028), as well as the
additional auctions conducted in FY2024 and FY2025 (covering electricity supply from FY2025 and
FY2026).
•  CONTEXT: OCCTO’s capacity market committee approved the measure on March 27, aiming to ensure
fair market operations, enhance reliability, and prevent unintended exits by participants facing higher-
than-anticipated penalty risks.



Regulator to set higher imbalance charges during tight supply
(Government statement, April 1)
•  Experts at the power market regulator, the Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission
(EGC), recommended significant changes to imbalance charges.
o  New maximum imbalance fee set at ¥300/ kWh during periods of tight supply (i.e. when
reserve margins fall below 3%), starting FY2026;
o  Maximum fee during periods of relatively tight supply (i.e. when reserve margins hit 8%) will
rise to ¥50/ kWh from ¥45 to reflect additional startup costs for backup power;
o  To mitigate prolonged price spikes, a cumulative pricing threshold mechanism will be

activated if an area’s spot market price exceeds ¥200/ kWh in 30 slots over a seven-day
period, subsequently lowering the maximum imbalance charge to ¥100/ kWh from the next
day.
•  The adjustments aim to incentivize generators to supply additional capacity while limiting financial
risks for smaller electricity retailers.
•  Some committee experts warned that lower imbalance charges in stressed areas could inadvertently
encourage power suppliers to redirect sales to neighboring regions where there may be higher market
prices.
•  CONTEXT: The expert recommendations look set to proceed. They are at the lowest range of what was
initially proposed as the maximum imbalance fee. At the previous meeting, experts reviewed the potential
for the fee to be as high as ¥600.

•  Buyers can submit applications via email, after which contract terms will be discussed for two weeks,
followed by contract finalization within an additional two weeks.
•  Power delivery points will be within Kyushu or at the JEPX, with pricing determined through bilateral
negotiation; transmission congestion costs to be borne by the buyer.



ANRE to lift high-voltage price controls on Okinawa Electric

(Government statement, March 31)
•  ANRE plans to lift the high-voltage price controls on Okinawa Electric in April 2026.
•  The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance Commission (EGC) also approved the decision, but it
called for the following points to be noted:
o  For three years after the lifting, the EGC will conduct special post-monitoring to ensure no
unreasonable price increases.
o  An appropriate wholesale trading environment must be maintained even after the lifting.
•  Okinawa Electric agreed to the EGC's requirements.
• TAKEAWAY: Okinawa is the last region to follow through on the liberalization of the market, but to date it has
not attracted strong interest from new players due to its small market size and distance from mainland Japan.

JWPA demands Nikkei’s correction in wake of report on offshore wind auction rules
(Organization statement, April 3)
•  In response to articles published by Nikkei on April 2 (online) and April 3 (print), the Japan Wind
Power Association requested a correction, citing factual inaccuracies related to the discussion of
offshore wind auction rule changes.
•  JWPA argued that Nikkei misrepresented its role and overstated industry consensus against the rule
changes.
•  The articles claimed that the JWPA conveyed concerns and opinions from its member companies,
implying it had taken an official stance against rule changes.
•  The JWPA said it had not expressed any concerns nor formulated a collective opinion on behalf of its
members but simply compiled individual views, which should not be construed as the association’s
position.

•  CONTEXT: The METI guideline revision would allow previously auctioned offshore wind projects – like
those won by Mitsubishi in 2021 – to sell electricity at higher prices than initially agreed. Critics,
including rival bidders, see this as unfair and a potential "bailout" for Mitsubishi that recently reported
large losses on those projects. Public consultation on the changes is open until April 27.

Renewables and Hydrogen on Display as the World Expo Opens in Osaka

When Expo 2025 opens in Osaka on April 13 it will offer visitors a look at some of Japan’s
latest renewable and clean energy solutions.

Hydrogen will feature heavily, with a full green hydrogen supply chain at the NTT and
Panasonic Group pavilions among the highlights. On the way to the Expo, visitors will be
able to ride Japan’s first commercial hydrogen-powered ferry, operated by Iwatani.
Hydrogen, along with carbon capture and reuse (CCU) technologies, will also be part of a
methanation demonstration operated by Osaka Gas.
In addition to powering hydrogen production, solar will be on display with perovskite
cells (PSCs) from Panasonic and Sekisui Chemical supplying renewable energy. As costs
for these flexible photovoltaic cells come down, they significantly expand the potential for
solar power’s adoption in heavily urbanized areas.

Another solution on display will highlight the opportunities in the nexus of clean energy
and digital tech innovation. Domestic telecoms giant NTT is showcasing a concept that
seeks to replace electrical circuitry with photonics, claiming both efficiency gains and a
lower demand for energy to sustain it.
Energy demonstrations
A World Expo is an opportunity to gauge some of the latest technology trends, although a
practical implementation of the solutions may be decades away. For example, Osaka’s
previous Expo in 1970 exhibited cordless phones, magnetic levitation (maglev) rail, local
area networking (LAN), and IMAX movies.

The 2025 edition has run into speed bumps with significant cost overruns, construction
delays, and some countries withdrawing their participation, but this event should provide
valuable insights on where energy and other technologies are heading.

Hydrogen supply chain
NTT Anode Energy and Panasonic Group are installing a hydrogen supply chain at their
pavilions to demonstrate the feasibility of green hydrogen generation with solar power. A
200-meter pipeline that also stores underground telecom lines will transport some of the
hydrogen from the NTT Pavilion to the Panasonic Group Pavilion. Panasonic will
demonstrate its fuel cell technology at both pavilions.
Panasonic’s H2 Kibou pure hydrogen fuel cell produces electricity by instigating a
chemical reaction between highly purified water and atmospheric oxygen. The PH3, a
recent model for some overseas markets, is a cogeneration system with a maximum DC
power output of 10 kW, with up to 8.2 kW of heat that can warm water up to 60°C.

Hydrogen-powered ferry
Iwatani’s hydrogen-powered boat, Mahoroba, will ferry visitors to the north side of
Yumeshima, the manmade island hosting the Expo. Running solely on hydrogen fuel cells,
this will be Japan’s first commercial operation of a hydrogen-powered boat. Work on this
project began in FY2021 with NEDO subsidies.

Perovskite solar cells
Panasonic Group’s pavilion will exhibit an artistic use of perovskite solar cells (PSC).
These cells are strong enough to serve dual functions as structural components in
buildings, such as windows. Panasonic is applying its technologies in materials, inkjet
coating, and laser treatment to design perovskite cells with a variety of sizes,
transparency, and decoration.

Sekisui Chemical will install 257 of its PSCs on 250 meters of roofing at the venue’s bus
terminal. This will be the largest combined use of PSCs in Japan.

Sixteen storage batteries will receive the electricity during the day and discharge at night
to provide power for the 282 100W LEDs illuminating the bus stops. The batteries have 14
days of capacity to cope with cloudy weather.

Methane
Osaka Gas will power the Japan Pavilion by generating electricity from e-methane fuel
that will be produced from CO2 and hydrogen through a methanation system built by
Kanadevia (formerly Hitachi Zosen).
The CO2 will come from several sources. One is biogas from garbage collected at the
Expo. Another is a direct air capture system installed by the Research Institute of
Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE).

The DAC project is commissioned by NEDO under the Moonshot R&D Program. Thirdly,
Air Water will provide a CO2 recovery system that will collect the gas from heating
equipment. Electricity generated by renewables will power electrolyzers to make
hydrogen.
















Source: Osaka Gas

Energy-efficient telecommunications
NTT is installing an All-Photonics Network (APN) to demonstrate how its Innovative
Optical and Wireless Network (IOWN) technology platform will provide low-power, high-
capacity, low-latency telecommunications.
The concept is to replace electricity in telecommunications with light. Although we
already use light to transmit data via fiber-optic cables, relays convert that light to
electricity so devices and their chips can handle it.

This conversion increases latency, while the electricity coursing through devices generates
heat that must be cooled, which in turn requires more electricity; hence the global rush to
boost power generation capacity for large data centers.

The IOWN technology is still far from completion. The service at the Expo will still use the
same amount of electricity as current telecommunications tech, but promises to transmit
20% more data. Much more interestingly, it will have 0.5% as much latency, which NTT
plans to demonstrate via real-time drone and robot operations, esports competitions, and
events where participants far from the venue join via APN to interact in real time.
As early as 2030, NTT has ambitious goals to cut the power consumption of devices by
99% and transmit 125 times as much data, while retaining the 200-fold reduction in
latency. However, replacing data transmissions between components and within chips
requires a considerable step up from the current semiconductor technology.

Conclusion
As a highly developed but resource-poor country that imports around 90% of its primary
energy, Japan has particularly strong incentives to come up with solutions to increase
domestic resilience and self-reliance. It has also cemented into law the target of carbon
neutrality by 2050.
Renewable and transitional energy technologies pioneered in Japan could find markets in
countries with ambitious clean energy goals. Potential buyers also include those with
concerns over the security of their supply chains for everything from Middle Eastern oil
and gas to Chinese silicon photovoltaic cells.

PSC is a good example of such technologies. METI expects the flexible cells to eventually
cost less than their silicon counterparts that are widely used today. The primary ingredient
for PSCs also happens to be iodine. Japan has a 30% share of global iodine production,
while Chile accounts for much of the rest. PSCs that perform well in Japan’s cities and
mountainous terrain could compete well.
If PSCs become cost-competitive against their silicon panels, it would unlock the next set
of technologies, such as those related to green hydrogen production at scale, which in turn
would bring closer the potential to tap into synthetic fuels, such as e-methane, which is
demonstrated at the Japan Pavilion.

Technology evolution is a complex, multi-stage process that often leads to surprise use
cases and results. At Expo 2025, organizers are hoping to show some of that magic, and
explain the technical and societal aspects behind it.

The World Expo in Osaka runs from April 13 to October 13.

Energy Jobs in Japan: Trump and Potential Impact on Energy Jobs
Following the return of Donald Trump to the White House and his predictable actions to
roll back clean energy initiatives, we’re constantly asked how we see this impacting Japan
and its energy sector’s labour market.

Naturally, when commenting on the future, a certain amount of speculation is necessary.
Various moving parts in state policy, investor appetite, and existing partnerships can shift
the trajectory of change. That disclaimer aside, overall we see a multitude of factors
pointing to a continued increase and further diversification of career opportunities across
Japan’s energy industry.

Japan is an energy consumer
Unlike the U,S., with abundant oil & gas reserves and economic opportunity to export
these commodities, Japan is a consumer rather than producer of fossil fuels, therefore the
same decisions the U.S. makes cannot support Japan to achieve the energy trilemma of
secure, cost-effective and sustainable energy.
As Japan still imports over 80% of its primary energy, and has an electricity sector that
remains at under 30% penetration of renewables – and barely 40% with renewables and
nuclear combined – the demand for non-fossil resources will remain high from an energy
independence and security perspective.

LNG is expected to have a new lease on life. Considering the close U.S./ Japan ties, and
Japan’s role as a regional LNG trader, this seems inevitable. Japan’s gas utilities, trading
houses and other fossil players see an opportunity to improve ties thanks to U.S.
production, investments in infrastructure, and increased shipping capacity and volumes –
both procured and traded.
Opportunities in clean fuel
With the potential rollback of the IRA in the U.S., many large-scale projects for green
hydrogen and ammonia, as well as e-methane, sustainable aviation fuel and other next-
generation fuels are facing potentially terminal economic difficulties.

Japan however, remains heavily invested in the ‘hydrogen economy’. Though clean
hydrogen will not solve all of Japan’s energy security challenges, as much of the fuel will
still need to be imported, industry has huge potential to become a global leader and
reignite technology exporting opportunities. Since Japan lost the photovoltaic and battery
markets to China, and the domestic wind turbine industry never got off the ground, the
focus and pressure from Japan’s industry giants to regain export market share is not to be
underestimated.
With Japan invested in the technology and the U.S. dropping projects, this opens the door
for increased partnerships from other partners capable of producing clean hydrogen or
ammonia at scale. We expect to see a shift in resources from Japanese investors and
trading houses away from the U.S. to Australia, Middle East and potentially as far abroad
as Canada.

In parallel to this shift in allocation of capital and partnerships, further market entry and
investment from private companies into Japan is expected. From an Australian
perspective, North Asia is a massive offtake opportunity for commodities. Japan with its

22



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

stable political landscape and existing infrastructure developed to serve the LNG value
chain stands out as the prime candidate to be a regional hub.

The trickle down effect on jobs here is significant. Development, project management,
construction, and engineering talent will be required to repurpose or build new port,
storage and transportation facilities. Investment and business development professionals
will be required both for outbound investment and leading multinational interests in
Japan.
Shift in alternative investment funds
The U.S. saw declining investment dollars into clean energy projects in the leadup to the
election, and this has accelerated since the result. Europe has seen steady growth, but Asia
has seen the biggest uptick in private investment into clean energy over the past 12
months.

Emerging markets in South East Asia attract risk capital, but Japan, despite having lower
potential returns, is attracting investment as fund managers look to hedge risks and
diversify their portfolios. This is backed up by an increasingly healthy PPA market and
opportunities in energy storage. Ares Management’s acquisition of GLP Capital Partners
and General Atlantic’s acquisition of Actis are among the examples of diversification and
outflows of U.S. capital. We also see direct investments from U.S. platforms such as I
Squared Capital, Stonepeak and others coming to Japan.
Though this trend was naturally motivated due to an increase in clean energy demand
and the proliferation of energy storage in Japan, we now see changes in the U.S.
accelerating it. Opportunities across all key functions of developers – project development,
engineering, asset management, investment, procurement etc – are directly increasing.
With energy storage in particular, this has second order effects of increasing opportunities
for other players in the ecosystem, such as forecasting and optimization solution providers
and energy traders.
Chance to double down on GX innovation?
Possibly the biggest loser of the U.S. policy changes will be clean tech companies. Without
support for their R&D, manufacturing and other heavy capital investments, the U.S. could
hemorrhage up to $50 billion of export revenue due to failed innovation and
manufacturing in clean tech sectors, according to Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab.

This naturally creates opportunities elsewhere, and in multiple areas Japan stands to take
advantage. Perovskites, next generation battery technologies, floating wind and turbines
capable of burning 100% hydrogen are a few examples.
Since PM Suga’s initial Green Innovation Fund, Japan’s political leadership has continued
to support innovation across green transformation sectors. And if they double down on
this, we will see further opportunities across various areas of R&D and manufacturing.

From a decarbonisation perspective, Japan will not be free of negative effects from the
change in the U.S. administration. The clearest illustration will be an almost certain
prolonging and increase of Japan’s role as a purveyor of LNG at a regional level.

Looking more broadly though, new opportunities exist in wider partnerships, innovation,
export markets and inbound investment into Japanese clean energy infrastructure.

ASIA   ENERGY     REVIEW

BY JOHN VAROLI

A brief overview of the region’s main energy events from the past week

Africa/ Energy financing
Chinese financiers are key players in Africa’s energy sector. To date, the China
Development Bank (CDB) and the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim Bank), have
provided $54 billion of energy finance on the continent. Those funds have primarily been
in coal and hydro power, but are now increasingly in renewable energy and natural gas.
Australia / LNG
The govt won’t take action to acquire additional quantities of LNG for Q3 2025 as it feels
confident that current volumes are sufficient to cover forecasted demand.

China / Renewables curtailment
China is curtailing more renewable energy capacity. About 6.2% of wind power and 6.1%
of solar power were curtailed in the first two months of the year, said the National Energy
Administration. In the same period in 2024, just 4% of wind and 4.3% of solar were
curtailed.
India / Renewable power potential
Renewable energy generation potential has reached 2,109 GW. The Energy Statistics
India 2025 report says the highest potential comes from wind at 1,163 GW (55.17%),
followed by solar energy with 748 GW (35.50%), and large hydro with 133 GW (6.32%).

India / Trump tariffs
U.S. tariffs on Indian energy exports present both short-term and long-term challenges,
requiring businesses to adopt agile strategies to mitigate risks. The tariffs will likely create
upward pressure on the cost of Indian energy exports to the U.S. market, which will lead
to less demand, according to Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.
Indonesia / Floating PV power
PowerChina completed the Cirata Floating PV Power Plant (192 MW), marking the
commissioning of the largest facility of its kind in SE Asia. It accounts for 25% of
Indonesia’s current renewable energy output.

Offshore wind
The global offshore wind industry is expected to add 19 GW in 2025, recovering from a
slowdown in 2024, said Rystad Energy. Capacity additions this year, with sector-wide
expenditure projected to hit $80 billion, will be a rebound from last year’s 8 GW.
Philippines / Energy financing
The World Bank approved an $800 million loan targeted to build more renewable energy
capacity throughout the country.

Singapore / Power
Singapore’s Energy Market Authority is reviewing how the power market should be
managed going forward, with a target completion by 2026.

Vietnam / Renewable energy
The application of a new power purchasing price – which would be implemented
retroactively for several years – by Vietnam Electricity, or EVN, puts 173 solar and wind
projects at risk of insolvency. The Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry has sent a
letter to parliament expressing such concerns.
