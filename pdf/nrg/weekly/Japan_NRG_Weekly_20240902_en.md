Govt plans ¥1.2 trillion GX budget for FY2025, with eye on major emitters

(Government statement, Aug 27)
•  The government sees a total of about ¥1.6 trillion fiscal budget for green transformation initiatives
in coming years, of which ¥1.2 trillion will be for FY2025, said METI and GX Minister Saito during
the GX Implementation Council meeting.
•  The key FY2025 budget plans are:
o  ¥255 billion for building domestic supply chains of GX solutions including perovskites,
offshore wind, storage batteries, FC systems, electrolyzers, etc;
o  ¥144 billion for EV, PHV and FCV;

o  ¥188 billion for homes;
o  ¥87 billion for hard-to-abate sectors;
o  ¥84 billion for SAF;
o  ¥83 billion for innovative nuclear reactors.
•  The government plans to amend the GX Promotion Act to mandate that major emitters take part in
the national emission trading scheme from 2026.

•  It will push a synergy of GX and digitization (DX), integrating power and communication
infrastructures and building data centers to support the AI sector.
•  Japan will continue to rely on gas-fired power as low carbon thermal power sources. It will work
with LNG producers to cut methane emissions.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Govt to provide ¥3 trillion for hydrogen supply chains

(Government statement, Aug 27)
o  The government will allocate about ¥3 trillion to build hydrogen supply chains as defined
in the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act, said METI and GX Minister Saito during the GX
Implementation Council.
o  Support includes the contract for difference scheme for low-carbon hydrogen, which calls
for subsidizing the difference between the actual production cost and market prices
(when they are lower than costs).




PM Kishida outlines key steps to advance GX, including need to restart TEPCO’s NPP

(Government statement, Aug 27)
•  PM Kishida led the 12th Green Transformation (GX) Implementation Meeting, emphasizing the
need to accelerate Japan's shift towards a sustainable economy.
•  Kishida outlined the main policies: AZEC; ¥150 trillion GX investment strategy; ¥20 trillion GX
economic transition bond plan; creation of a GX Promotion Organization to foster public-private
collaboration; and he stressed the importance of enhancing renewable energy and nuclear power.

•  Kishida emphasized the need to restart existing nuclear power plants in Eastern Japan, particularly
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPP, in order to reduce dependency on thermal power and to address
regional power cost disparities. He also called for ensuring safety and local support before
proceeding with the restart.
•  Kishida noted that Western Japan, where NPP restarts have progressed well, has found it easier to

accept applications for grid connections from new data centers.
•  Kishida said a ministerial meeting will be held on nuclear power in early September.
• TAKEAWAY: Kishida has less than a month left as PM. While he seeks to push through the restart of TEPCO’s
only operable NPP, the main stumbling block – the governor of Niigata Pref – knows there’s only a few weeks
of pressure to navigate. A new PM, with many issues to deal with, is unlikely to fight for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
NPP restart early in his term. The Niigata governor is balancing the pro-restart voices of several municipalities
connected to the NPP with ambivalence or opposition from the rest of nearby towns and cities.





METI requests a ¥2.4 trillion budget for FY2025, up 24%
(Government statement, Aug 30)
•  METI requested a ¥2.36 trillion budget for FY2025, up 24% from the current FY.
•  Energy spending is spread out between the Special Accounts for Energy Measures, which include
upgrades of existing infrastructure, and the GX Accounts, which are new projects such as nuclear

reactor R&D.

•  The Agency will focus on risk mitigation by offering guarantees and equity support in areas where
private financial institutions may hesitate to take risks. Agency head Tsutsui Yoshinobu said the
guarantee could cover up to 100% of debt.
•  Key areas of support include: Hydrogen/ ammonia; Chemical complexes; Sustainable aviation fuel
(SAF), and Renewable energy businesses. The Agency may also support next-gen nuclear reactor

development.
•  Overall, it wants to support projects with significant regional economic impact.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
MoE to launch PSC promotion scheme
(Nikkei, Aug 27)
o  In FY2025, the MoE plans to launch a new scheme to promote the installation of

perovskite solar cell (PSC) systems on municipality facilities.
o  The MoE seeks a ¥11.9 billion budget for FY2025 to support municipalities introducing
PSC, storage batteries and other clean energy systems.
o  CONTEXT: Urban municipalities are interested in PSC systems because they lack space
for wind or solar farms. PSC films are thin, light and can be integrated into windows,
attached on walls, etc.
• TAKEAWAY: In addition to helping producers of PSC modules, the subsidy will assist inverter and other

component makers while they work on establishing product standards, developing solution-specific product
suites, and boosting quality levels to sell to private sector users.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Chiyoda City plans PSC window installations on local facilities

(Japan NRG, Aug 27)
o  Chiyoda City (Tokyo) will install windows covered with PSC films on community facilities,
if the three-month trial yields positive results.
o  Tokyo-based architectural products company YKK AP provided the window prototype
that’s now displayed publicly.




METI Minister Saito declares bid for LDP leadership

(Japan NRG, Aug 30)
•  METI Minister Saito Ken said he will run in the LDP leadership race set for Sept 27.
•  He pledged to step up efforts in semiconductor tech and the shift to clean energy amid strong
global competition. Saito also wants to restore public confidence in the LDP.
•  CONTEXT: Saito started his political career at METI in 1983, and served as director of the electric
power infrastructure development division at ANRE. He also served as Minister of Agriculture,
Forestry, and Fisheries and Minister of Justice.
•  CONTEXT: Saito was elected five times since the 2009 lower house election. He was first elected

to the Diet in the same year as Koizumi Shinjiro, the 43-year-old former environment minister. Saito
was once a member of the faction led by Ishiba Shigeru, the former LDP secretary-general who
also plans to run in the LDP leadership election. Now, Saito doesn’t belong to any LDP faction.
• TAKEAWAY: While Saito doesn’t belong to a faction, he’s running in response to calls from fellow lawmakers.
The recent scandal over fundraising kickbacks, which resulted in 39 LDP members held responsible and the

majority expelled, may have strengthened Saito’s position as an impartial lawmaker. Several LDP factions have
been accused of kicking back a portion of fundraising ticket sales to members without reporting. Other
candidates – Koizumi and Ishiba – have gained support from veteran members like former PM Suga and Aso.
Saito would tout his experience as vital for economic revival, especially on the energy policy front.





Japanese companies to standardized designs of LCO2 carriers
(Nikkei, Aug 26)
•  Seven companies, including Imabari Shipbuilding and NYK Line, are developing vessels for
liquefied CO2. This aims to standardize designs to reduce costs and help mass production across
Japan.
•  Other companies involved are Japan Marine United, Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, and Nihon Shipyard.

They are working with major maritime firms such as NYK Line, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, and Kawasaki
Kisen.
•  The plan includes standardizing CO2 storage tanks with capacities of over 20,000 m3. The firms
will also explore vessels powered by ammonia.
•  CONTEXT: Japan seeks a leading global market share in next-gen ship orders. The CCS industry is
of major importance for Japan, as it aims to store between 120 million to 240 million tons of CO2
per year by 2050. A significant chunk of the CO2 will have to be sent overseas. Yet, Japan faces

challenges in building and designing LCO2 carriers and storage tanks. The existing fleet is limited,
with only a few vessels in operation. Also, competition with Chinese companies like Dalian
Shipyard adds pressure. Dalian recently launched advanced LCO2 carriers for the Northern Light
Project, and intends to become the leader in the sector.
• TAKEAWAY: Japan has limited suitable storage sites for CO2 storage. Thus, maritime transport to distant
locations is necessary. Japan now needs to build reliable means of transport to countries such as Malaysia and

Australia for storage. This is also evident by the two new overseas CCS projects added to the Japanese CCS
Advanced Projects.




Tsubame BHB secures order for second ammonia production plant
(Company statement, Aug 27)
•  Tsubame BHB received an order for its second small-scale ammonia production facility in Japan.

The startup seeks to help create domestic production of the clean-burning gas.
•  The new facility, using Tsubame BHB’s low-temperature, low-pressure Electride catalyst
technology, will produce 500 tons of ammonia annually.
•  The basic design work started in January and the firm will now make a detailed design. Ammonia
production is due to begin in summer 2026.
•  CONTEXT: Tsubame’s selling point is that its tech can synthesize ammonia at low temperatures
and pressures. This would be simpler to manage than the Haber-Bosch process that’s widely used

to make ammonia, and which requires high-temperature, high-pressure reaction conditions, as well
as large-scale production.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
World’s first ammonia-fueled tug boat launched
(Company statement, Aug 23)
o  On Aug 23, the world’s first ammonia-fueled tug boat, Sakigake, launched in Tokyo Bay.
It’s operated by Shin Nippon Kaiyosha, a subsidiary of NYK group.




Toyota and BMW cooperate on fuel cell vehicles and R&D

(Asia Nikkei, Aug 27)
•  Toyota and BMW will upgrade a decades-old partnership to cooperate in fuel cell vehicle
development.
•  Toyota will supply key components, such as hydrogen tanks and fuel cell systems.
•  BMW aims to start mass producing fuel cell vehicles within a few years.
•  Toyota Motor and BMW see the slowdown in EV sales as a chance for fuel cell vehicles to gain
popularity given their quicker charging time.




Energy Concierge sets up sites for grid-scale BESS

(Company statement, Aug 22)
•  BESS developer Energy Concierge set up several sites in the service area of Shikoku Electric where
it has secured connection slots for storage batteries for the power grid.
•  The firm plans to build a 50 MW/ 200 MWh storage battery facility on a high-voltage scale by April
2025.
•  The firm plans to establish an integrated service system — from overall project planning to EPC,
optimal operation, and maintenance management.

•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:
Itochu firm to take over ONE Energy’s BESS, PV leasing business
(Company statement, Aug 26)
o  Itochu subsidiary TRENDE will acquire ONE Energy’s renewables business.

Chiyoda to commercialize CO2-based method for resin production
(Nikkei, Aug 28)
•  Chiyoda Corp plans to be the first to commercialize a process that uses CO2 to produce
paraxylene, a key ingredient in resins for clothing and automotive parts, reducing CO2 emissions

across the supply chain.
•  The process, developed with Toyama University, aims to build a large-scale demo plant by 2026,
with the goal of launching a commercial plant by the 2030s. This could potentially cut emissions by
40,000 tons per 10,000 tons of production.
•  Despite higher production costs compared to oil-based methods, Chiyoda anticipates demand for
CO2-derived paraxylene in industries like fashion, where reducing environmental impact is now
critical.

•  CONTEXT: Paraxylene is produced by reacting CO2 and hydrogen using a substance made from a
mixture of metal catalysts and zeolite catalysts.



Euglena and Petronas begin research on algae-based biofuel
(Nikkei, Aug 28)
•  Euglena has partnered with Malaysian oil major Petronas to research and develop biofuels from
microalgae.
•  The collaboration will focus on various aspects such as algae cultivation and the extraction of their
oil, with research mainly in Malaysia. By 2025, the firms will assess progress and decide on trial

production of biofuel.
•  The partnership also plans to invest in a biofuel plant in Malaysia, with operations expected to start
in late 2028, initially using waste cooking oil but potentially shifting to algae as a raw material.



Mitsubishi Electric and Siemens Energy to develop DC switching stations

and DC circuit breaker requirement specifications.
•  The agreement aims to realize multi-terminal HVDC systems to enable efficient operation of large-

scale renewable energy resources.


MoE solicits public feedback on widening e-scrap trade control

(Government statement, Aug 24)
•  The MoE is soliciting public feedback on its proposal to include used electronic and electric
equipment in the definition of e-scrap.
•  The Act for the Control of Export and Import of Specified Hazardous and Other Wastes bans
unlicensed trade of electrical and electronic components and scrap, but not used equipment.
•  The feedback period ends on Sept 23.
•  CONTEXT: Used EVs and used car batteries are not included in the scope of the proposed trade

control. But EV motors with rare earth magnets are.

Chances decrease for Tomari NPP restart in time for launch of Rapidus chip plant

(Hokkaido Shimbun, Aug 26)
•  Hokkaido Electric wants to restart the Tomari NPP in December 2026, but this seems unlikely due
to:
1) Major changes in plans for preventing spent fuel on transport ships running adrift in case of a
tsunami;
2) Extensions to the inspection schedule.
•  Aside from the spent-fuel matter, the utility will report to the NRA at the end of 2024 on protecting

the plant from tsunamis and volcanic activity.
•  A top NRA official said that at the regulatory review’s current pace, the plant won’t be online in
time to cope with the ramp up in energy demand in Hokkaido once the state-backed
semiconductor manufacturer Rapidus starts mass production in 2027.
• TAKEAWAY: The semiconductor factory being built by Rapidus is forecast to require 600 MW or more in
power capacity. That could be covered by the restart of Tomari NPP’s Unit 3, which is also a relatively new
reactor. However, a regulatory review of the facility is in its 12th year, and progress is negligible. That indicates

a huge power demand gap in Hokkaido for non-CO2 emitting generators. Rapidus said it wants to use
electricity that doesn’t cause GHG emissions.
•  SIDE DEVELOPMENT:

Hokkaido Electric to build port outside Tomari NPP as tsunami measure
(Nikkei, Aug 27)
o  Hokkaido Electric will build a new port outside the premises of the Tomari NPP as a
tsunami countermeasure. The port would receive vessels transporting nuclear fuel.
o  The utility is also considering the use of existing ports outside the facility. The NRA did
not oppose this plan.
o  Hokkaido Electric has considered mooring ships within the plant's premises. The NRA

raised concerns in April about the feasibility of such measures in a tsunami. The new port
is planned along the coastline within Tomari Village. Specifics like location, construction
period, and costs are still under discussion.




TEPCO to lead major grid upgrades to accommodate data centers, chip plants
(Nikkei, Aug 29)
•  TEPCO Power Grid plans to invest ¥470 billion by FY2027 to strengthen its transmission network,
focusing on expanding large substations, particularly in the Tokyo metropolitan area, where data

center demand is rising.
•  Nationally, 18 new or expanded substations are planned by 2030; eight will be in the Tokyo area.
Inzai (Chiba Pref), Tama and Sagamihara are of particular focus.

10



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

•  CONTEXT: TEPCO’s outlay represents a tripling of investments in transmission infrastructure over
the next five years compared to the previous period.
•  Similar challenges are faced in Kyushu and Hokkaido, where power companies are upgrading
substations to support new semiconductor factories.
•  Kyushu Electric is expected to invest ¥10 billion in substations at two locations; and Hokkaido

Electric will build a substation near Rapidus in 2027.
• TAKEAWAY: The investments are expected to be funded from wheeling charges paid by generators. These
charges were raised nationwide last fiscal year to fund infrastructure upgrades. Debates over who will shoulder
more of the infrastructure investments continue, with some interest in tapping into state GX funding.




DX Minister opens up to nuclear restarts, replacing old reactors

(Japan NRG, Aug 26)
•  Digital Transformation Minister Kono Taro wants to boost electricity supply amid growing power
demand due to expansion of data centers and AI tech.
•  Following his Aug 26 announcement on joining the ruling LDP leadership race, Kono said he’ll also
promote renewables, hydrogen and ammonia.
•  However, he’s concerned that doubling the volume of renewables might not meet growing power
demand by 2050.

•  He said Japan will need other clean tech such as CCS, nuclear fusion, as well as replacing old
nuclear units with next-gen reactors.
•  CONTEXT: This will be the third time that Kono will run in the LDP leadership race; he also ran in
2009 and 2021. Some of his previous policies included phasing out nuclear power, which
contradicted the LDP’s stance. While this garnered some public support, it alienated Kono from
veteran party members. After joining the Cabinet in 2015, Kono removed past blog posts

criticizing nuclear reactor restarts. In the 2021 LDP race, Kono discarded his earlier stance and
stated that offline nuclear reactors certified as safe should resume operations.




Rokkasho spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plant to face 27th delay
(Company statement, Japan NRG, Aug 29)
•  Japan Nuclear Fuel (JNFL) president Masuda said completion of the Rokkasho nuclear fuel
reprocessing plant will be postponed to FY2026; an extra two and a half years are needed to
address issues related to NRA regulatory reviews.
•  Aomori Governor Miyashita said the repeated delays have eroded trust in Japan's nuclear fuel

cycle policy. He expressed doubts in JNFL’s management.
•  JNFL’s Masuda said he’s committed to completing the facility.
•  CONTEXT: This is the 27th delay since construction began in 1993. The reprocessing plant is now
undergoing NRA reviews, such as regarding seismic design.
•  JNFL proposed seismic evaluations to extend until November 2025.
• TAKEAWAY: Even if JNFL meets the new targets, the plant's completion will be 30 years behind the original
1997 goal. Rokkasho is the center of Japan's nuclear fuel cycle, which aims to reprocess and reuse spent

11

nuclear fuel. As completion is delayed, spent nuclear fuel is accumulating at NPP sites and they need to resort
to other storage options, such as on-site interim storage facilities. Yet, this poses challenges such as gaining
local consensus, and casts doubts over the country's nuclear policy.




NRA approves draft deeming Tsuruga NPP Unit 2 as unfit to restart

(Government statement, Aug 28)
•  The NRA approved a draft review deeming Unit 2 of the Tsuruga NPP as "failing"; which means it
won’t be able to restart.
•  This would be the first restart denial since the NRA's founding in 2012.
•  The NRA concluded that "K Fault," about 300 meters north of the NPP, might be active.
•  The NRA will invite public feedback before a final decision, expected in autumn.

•  CONTEXT: The review has been long and troubled by JAPC’s mishandling, with cases of
unauthorized data changes. Currently, out of the 27 reactors that have applied for restarts, 17 have
passed NRA review, and 12 are in operation.




KEPCO to restart Takahama NPP Unit 1 later this month
(Company statement, Aug 23)
•  KEPCO said it will resume full operation of Takahama NPP Unit 1 on Sept 24.
•  A regular inspection has been ongoing since June 2.
•  Next inspection is scheduled for Sept 2025.

Miyagi exempts Tohoku Electric’s wind project from renewables tax
(Asahi Shimbun, Aug 27)
•  Miyagi Pref approved a wind power project by a Tohoku Electric Group firm in Shiroishi City as the
area’s first “tax-exempt” project.
•  Renewables projects in Miyagi are subject to taxation if they involve large-scale forest
development.
•  The project will install eight wind turbines on nine hectares of forested land, with a generating

capacity of 33.6 MW, and plans to start operation in or after FY2026.
•  CONTEXT: In April, the Miyagi Ordinance imposed a non-statutory tax on owners of renewables
facilities (solar, wind or biomass) installed with development of forest areas larger than half a
hectare, in proportion to power output. But the tax won’t be levied on projects agreed upon by
the local community. Projects that began construction before the effective date are also exempted.

MoE minister urges Tokyu Land to revise plans for wind farm over threat to rare bird
(Government statement, Aug 26)
•  The Environment Minister urged Tokyu Land to either cancel or relocate the firm's planned wind
farm in Matsumae Town (Hokkaido) due to potential impact on white-tailed sea eagles, a rare
species.
•  The comment was in response to Tokyu Land’s environmental impact assessment.

•  The project’s planned capacity is 51.6 MW, with 12 turbines. The site would cover 740 hectares.
•  CONTEXT: Nearby, Tokyu Land operates the ReENE Matsumae wind farm (41 MW capacity). In
cooperation with the Matsumae government and Hokkaido Electric, earlier this year Tokyu Land
launched a local microgrid to transmit power generated at the ReENE Matsumae wind farm in case
of a massive power outage, and to ensure access to stable power supply for local government
offices, shelters, etc.




Kansai area gets 2 GW of power from Chubu amid tight reserve

(Company statement, Aug 26)
•  On Aug 26, during hotter than expected temperatures that resulted in greater power demand,
Kansai Transmission and Distribution had to turn to Chubu Electric Power Grid for extra supply.
•  After OCCTO issued a formal request, Chubu Electric sent 2.01 GW of electricity in three
installments between 1 p.m. and 8 p.m.
•  Trouble at a local power plant also contributed to the tight supply-demand situation. KEPCO has
not revealed which power plant had the problem.

Sumitomo files nickel mine restructuring plan in UK court
(Company statement, Aug 29)
•  In a UK court, Sumitomo Corp filed a debt restructuring plan for the Ambatovy nickel mine and

refinery in Madagascar.
•  The plan aims to address facility problems that occurred in FY2023.
•  The mining company, Ambatovy Minerals, and the refining company Dynatec Madagascar are
owned 54.71% by Sumitomo; and Korea Mine Rehabilitation, and Mineral Resources Corp own the
rest.
• TAKEAWAY: Sumitomo did not elaborate on the “facility problems” but told Japan NRG that the mine and

the refinery are operating as usual. BHP, which has nickel supply contracts with Tesla, will suspend its
Australian mine operation in October due to market oversupply. BHP produces 82,000 tons/ year of nickel.




China’s export curb pushes up antimony prices
(Japan NRG, Aug 30)
•  Prices of antimony, which are used for solar glass, have surged 20% after China announced new

export rules for 12 antimony products, requiring export approval starting Sept 15.
•  According to Shanghai Metals Market, ingot prices are about to hit $25,000/ ton, compared to
$21,000/ ton before the announcement on Aug 15.
•  International antimony prices have been at historical highs since spring due to shortages of
antimony concentrates as miners focused on gold production. Antimony is a byproduct of gold.
•  CONTEXT: The export control covers 99.99%-grade antimony trioxide used for solar glass, and
antimony hydroxide for semiconductors; but not antimony scrap, which is hardly traded.

• TAKEAWAY: China accounts for about 90% of Japan’s antimony trioxide imports, but antimony hydroxide
import sources are spread out among 14 countries. After Sept 15, trades with China will likely slow until there
is clarity on the Commerce Ministry’s approval criteria. On the other hand, historically high prices will motivate
mines to increase output.

ANALYSIS

BY MAYUMI WATANABE

The Perovskite Boom Is Not Without Setbacks

Japan is betting big on perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology to boost green energy
capacity and to become a global leader in one of the most innovative new clean
energy technologies.

The electrical characteristics of perovskite compounds, verified by Professor Miyasaka
of Toin University in Yokohama in 2009, hold the promise of having the ability to
significantly magnify solar energy potential.

Some PSC modules are less than 1 mm thick, weighing under 1.5 kg/ m2, and do not
require the extreme heat (about 1,000°C) with which current silicon-based solar panels
are produced.

Any surface of buildings, bridges, cars, etc can be used as zero-emission power
stations by simply applying these film-like modules, according to Dr. Miyasaka.

This technology, however, has a few major drawbacks: low power efficiency (less than
20%); difficulties in establishing systematic mass production; vulnerability to moisture
and heat; and more.


Solutions have yet to be found. And yet, the government wants to make PSC
commercially viable as soon as possible, and towards that goal it’s encouraging
businesses to do field trials to quickly identify any problems and then to find solutions.

Over 30 field studies
Perovskite compounds consist of divalent-structured metals such as lead and halogen
group elements, such as iodine. To make a cell, transport layers, electrodes, electricity
conducting layers, protective sealants, etc, are stacked on and under the compounds.

Still, PSC has unresolved issues. Unstable behaviors such as hysteresis, which makes it
difficult to measure electricity, are unexplained. EneCoat Technologies has achieved a
20% power efficiency, which equals that of silicon cells, for a 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm sized
module, but performances of bigger modules are lower.

Despite all the challenges, field trials in Japan are proliferating, with over 30 tests
currently running. Core test organizers are PSC module manufacturers – Sekisui
Chemical, EneCoat Technologies, Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions, Ricoh and
Peccell Technologies.

The government strategy is to focus on PSC-derived energy solutions, not just
bringing to market high-performance solar modules. This is why field studies are
encouraged even though there’s still no uniform way to measure PSC performance.




21



CONTACT  US: info@japan-nrg.com

These companies recruit test partners at trade shows and make cold calls to partner
candidates. On the other hand, Panasonic, Aisin and Kaneka have been secretive,
working mostly within their own corporate groups.

There will be more field trials. The Green Innovation Fund will provide a total of ¥37.8
billion for tests starting this year through FY2030. To receive funding, the projects will
need to meet the production cost target of ¥14/ kWh, which is at the level of other
photovoltaic technologies. NEDO is not the sole funding source.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government and the city of Yokohama have launched field
test grants. Companies are discussing collaborations with municipalities without
subsidy programs.

In addition to PSC manufacturers, peripheral component makers, construction
engineering firms, tech startups, etc, will be conducting tests. Right now, the tests are
concentrated in space-constrained Tokyo desperately seeking solar installation space,
but will spread out more geographically.

Field tests organically evolve
Toshiba ESS launched the first public PSC field test in February 2023 in a Tokyu Group
railway station in Yokohama. A month later, Sekisui Chemical and JERA set up several
PSC-film covered panels in JERA thermal power plants in Yokosuka and Kashima.


The Sekisui panels were installed at different angles, to compare performances.
Similarly, EneCoat and JGC placed their prototypes at Yokohama and Hokkaido sites,
but their modules were more refined. They made removable PSC films that were
tucked into plastic sheets which resembled curtains. The goal was to see how wind
affects performance and endurance required to survive typhoons.

In the second half of 2023, more tests began to simulate usage situations. There were
installations on stable building walls, on fragile rooftops, on or near water, and
indoors. Some were connected to storage batteries to understand ways to integrate
PSC and storage battery systems. Most tests run for a year, but some last longer as
they are a part of long-term efforts to develop new product lines.

The most common tests are PSC-film covered building walls, taking advantage of the
PSC’s lightweight characteristic. However the walls, if in direct contact with heat-
generating PSC films for a long period of time, may erode. The films were placed on
top of sheets or plates, and in some cases, were framed in aluminum for increased
stability.

In a bid to develop easy-to-install products, Sekisui and Senko Group measured the
time to install the systems. Performance on cylinder pillars, electric poles, and other
curvy objects, as well as the sun’s best and worst directions during different times of
the day, were scrutinized as lights refract on spherical surfaces.

The PSC power efficiency is lower on walls compared to rooftops, due to the sunlight
angles. However, there is more wall than roof space. The walls might not make the
building self-sufficient, but they might reduce offsite PPA purchase volumes.

Most PSC walls are on building exteriors but there are tests for indoor installations
where sunlight is often blocked. Self-chargeable lighting systems, sensors and data
transmission devices are also being developed.

First movers emerge
“Perobusukaito” is fast becoming a household term thanks to Sekisui’s TV
commercials. The growing public recognition is incentivising businesses to study
market entries.

First movers are emerging. In August, the Miyagi-based glass substrate processing
firm, Kuramoto, announced it will launch the country’s first mass PSC production plant
in northeast Japan in February 2025. The company has produced inverted thin-film
organic solar panel prototypes, but has no track record in perovskites. It will license
relevant technologies from developers in and outside Japan.

Urban municipalities also count as first movers. Tokyo needs perovskites on and
around buildings to increase green energy capacity. Yokohama is aiming for a carbon
neutral port, capitalizing on warehouse roofs to install perovskites. Other
municipalities are watching if demand is strong enough to fuel improvements.

There is, currently, little incentive for end-users because perovskite advantages over
other thin-film photovoltaic products are not clear. There are monocrystalline silicon
and cadmium telluride solar panels that are over 1 mm thick but are bendable and
nearly rollable. Their power efficiencies are higher, they’re resistant to seawater and
moisture, and have greater endurance.

The above raises the question: Other than for publicity and to meet municipality zero-
emission building requirements, is there a point in investing in PSC systems if they are
not fully reliable power sources?

Darkest before dawn
A lack of reliable data on performance, heat release and erosion speed does not help
interested users. The companies conducting the tests have not disclosed their
findings, claiming this is sensitive data closely related to product development.
Municipalities are not pushing their disclosure either.

The government’s ¥14/ kWh cost target has disincentivized metallography researchers
who feel it is too ambitious. Funding has become difficult unless a pathway to ¥14/
kWh is shown. But the PSC industry desperately needs a new lead-free raw material
mix to replace the presently utilized lead iodide-based perovskites.


There are encouraging signs of PSC technology advances. A year ago, PSC films sized
25 x 30 cm were considered ‘large’. PSC film at tests launched in the past two months
are over 1 meter in length. While the successes of first movers are creating a positive
mood, there are still uncertainties on whether demand prospects alone will speed up
product developments.

The purpose of robust government support for perovskites was to be self-sufficient in
photovoltaic panels, which today Japan almost entirely imports. But if domestic
manufacturers are not able to deliver the quality, price and quantity that users need,
the dominance of imports won’t change.

This suggests a few hard moments of truth are coming. Public and private
stakeholders will need to identify more specifically which issues will require further
funding. Encouraging healthy growth of both the quality of PSC systems and their
demand are essential in making perovskites a new green energy success story.

ANALYSIS

BY JAPAN NRG TEAM
Power Companies Ignore New Balancing Market Set Up By METI

At least three times this summer, large volumes of electricity had to be transferred
quickly between the major regions into which Japan’s power system is split. The
technical aspect of this has so far not caused notable issues, despite ongoing
concerns over the country’s aging and segregated power grid. But there are questions
around how this electricity is procured.

As part of the liberalization of the electricity sector over the past decade, METI
oversaw the unbundling of regional power utilities (EPCOs) and the creation of several
market platforms to facilitate non-discriminatory trading in electricity. But one area
where this free-market push has struggled to yield results is ‘balancing’, which is the
system under which regional transmission operators (TSOs) procure electricity when
output fails to meet scheduled levels due to weather, natural disaster, or other
reasons.

The balancing marketplace, also known as the Supply-Demand Adjustment Market,
was set up in 2021 to help TSOs manage their local grid and system security. This
platform was meant to bring together the nine TSOs that cover all of Japan (aside
from Okinawa), thus making it easier – and cheaper – to source generation resources
from another region when in need. The problem is that almost half of TSOs barely use
this market.

The situation has implications beyond power market design. A number of battery
operators entering the Japanese market are looking at options to sell power (i.e.,
outside of bilateral agreements). In addition to the established spot and futures power
markets, there’s interest in tapping into revenues from balancing.


What’s more, METI envisions an evolution of Japan’s electricity markets that would
include the adoption of something akin to the PJM Ancillary Services Market in the
U.S., a nodal structure and a three-part offer system in which balancing is one of the
components.

So, can the energy planners and power industry players make the balancing system
work?

Basic background
Japan has 10 regional transmission and distribution (T&D) companies. Both the
transmission operators (TSO) and distribution operators (DSO) were once part of the
10 vertically integrated, regional power utilities (EPCOs).

The utilities have formed holding or group structures in which the power generation
and retail businesses compete with new market entrants. The transmission of
electricity, however, is supposed to be a neutral space, with TSOs and DSOs acting
independently of the interests of their generation or retail group firms.

Note, the Okinawa Prefecture grid has also been deregulated, but it does not have a
spot market. The region operates separately from the others because Okinawa is not
connected to the other nine TSOs.

In 2015, to facilitate coordination between the TSOs, the Organisation for Cross-
regional Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO) was created. It helps
manage the technical and logistical side of the transport of electricity between
different regions. It also acts as an information hub, sharing data with METI and the
TSOs, which helps to gain a sense of the reserve margins in each region, which are the
priority power users, which users can be asked to reduce consumption in an
emergency, or how best to coordinate during a natural disaster.

OCCTO is also in charge of the cross-regional interconnections plan, which is a
roadmap to improving the power grid and the connections between the nine main
regions. Coordination is vital in a country where the grid is not only split between
regions but is also divided into two separate frequency zones due to the historical
development of electricity infrastructure.

Shifting of the balance
TSOs are in charge of maintaining a balance of power supply and demand in their
region at any one time. This involves forecasting and monitoring seasons, weather,
and fluctuations on any given day, hour, or even five-minute interval.

This task has grown ever more complex with the rapid expansion of the number of
power generation sources as more solar, wind, biomass and small hydro plants are
brought online. The weather dependence of solar and wind generation in particular,
as well as more volatile weather conditions, require a faster and more precise TSO
response.

To address the situation, METI created a balancing market that would allow TSOs
easier procurement of power as needed. Available generation capacity is offered
according to four types of adjustment (primarily split by the speed of response, its
source, and how quickly the facility can start to provide electricity). Units of trade are
three-hour increments (although, the Tertiary Balancing Reserve② option is expected
to change to 30 minutes from FY 2025). The buyers are, of course, the TSOs. That
makes this market different from the spot (JEPX) market, where the consumers are
electricity retailers or large users, or futures markets, where power generators and
financial players trade.

The supply-demand adjustment marketplace is operated by EPRX (Electric Power
Reserve eXchange), which involves all nine of the main TSOs. The current
representative director is from Tokyo Electric Power Grid.

The counterpart to the EPRX is the Imbalance System, which is a penalty levied on
power providers when generation deviates from scheduled volumes. When that or a
demand spike incurs an imbalance between demand and supply, TSOs are tasked
with securing the difference. As of April 2022, the imbalance fee is based on the cost
of securing alternatives.


Bug in the system
A nationwide balancing/ ancillary services marketplace should make the supply-
demand adjustments easier and likely cheaper. To give an example, if one large
power generator suddenly fails, then other generators automatically detect the
change of frequency, and adjust output to restore to original state.

Therefore if the power grid is small, and only limited generators are operating, they
may not have adequate capacity in reserve to cover the shortfall. The more potential
facilities in reserve, the more stable the system. Equally important, a larger power grid
can absorb marginal errors in demand forecast, defraying costs.

METI first allowed TSOs to start public offering of ancillary services back in 2016, the
same year as the full liberalization of electricity retail sales.

However, a problem emerged. TSOs are part of EPCOs. Most of the resources that
TSOs want to access for balancing are still owned by EPCO groups. As such, there’s
little benefit for TSOs in a public offering system. In fact, securing adjustment capacity
via the market creates extra work and bureaucracy for TSOs.

With most of the power facilities equipped with automatic frequency detection, grid
operators can easily tap into pumped storage hydro power when there is a shortage,
or adjust power demand upward by letting these same plants draw power to pump
water to a higher reservoir.

In theory, EPCO unbundling has made each of the group’s assets independent and
any power sales between them is a “trade”. In practice, at least four TSOs seem to
barely utilize the EPRX, and that can’t be put down only to the EPRX being slow to
expand its product range.

2024)

Trade Record of Primary Balancing Reserve on the EPRX, April to July 2024
(Tokyo and Chubu areas)


















It should be noted that balancing per se is taking place. It’s just that half of the TSOs
are not reaching out to the EPRX to do so. Instead, they’re securing adjustments via
the old relief system (“Utilize Remaining Capacity”) that existed before the arrival of
EPRX.


METI pressure
If TSOs don’t utilize the EPRX, then there will be little point in new power facilities
seeking to offer their services there. It will also impact the more complex “three-part”
trading offer system that METI seeks to introduce in markets in the coming years,
which include inputs for intraday (kW) and adjustment (delta kW) power.

That’s why METI has started discussing reforms via advisory councils and also reported
its findings to Tokyo and Chubu EPCOs. According to the 99th session of System
Design Council of Advisers hosted by power sector regulator EGC on July 30, Tokyo
and Chubu EPCO officials said that they’re not using EPRX because “It is difficult to
precisely forecast power demand and supply due to unexpected changes of weather,
especially for solar generation.”

They also pushed back against government overtures to utilize EPRX, noting that
contracts between power suppliers and retailers do not specify that all balancing
reserves are procured via tEPRX, and so each TSO will use the best options that it has
at hand.

Government pressure may yet pay off. Tokyo and Chubu grid operators agreed to try
purchasing more balancing reserves via EPRX.

With METI expected to introduce its “three-part offer” system by 2028, there are only
a few years left to resolve the situation.

said the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. These include tea
plantations and manufacturing, as well as fertilizer industries. Their gas use grew 136%
in 2023.

Indonesia / Solar power
Aslan Energy Capital (Singapore) and PT Calypte Sugi Power (Indonesia) inked a MoU
to develop a 2 GW power generation hub, creating a large-scale solar and clean
energy facility in the Riau Islands. By the end of 2026, they plan to produce 1 GW of
solar power, and to reach 2 GW by 2028.

Indonesia / Wind power
Philippines-based ACEN inked a partnership with PT Barito Renewables Energy to
develop wind energy projects across Indonesia.

Malaysia / Solar power
Insufficient infrastructure may hinder the growth of solar power because the grid is not
flexible enough to accommodate growing supply, said think tank Ember. Malaysia has
abundant solar energy promise, with 269 GW of potential capacity.

Malaysia / Natural gas
Malaysia’s national upstream company Petronas Carigali has brought on stream its
Kasawari giant gas field on Block SK 316 offshore Sarawak. Discovered in 2011, about
200 km off the Sarawak coast, the field contains about 10 trillion cubic feet of gas.

New Zealand / Fossil fuels and Hydro
Think tank Ember said the total fossil fuel-fired electricity generation from January
through July was 4.36 TWh, 67% higher YoY, and nearly matching the 1.86 TWh drop
in generation from the country's hydroelectric projects in the same period.

Southeast Asia / Solar power
Levanta Renewables acquired six solar PV projects: three sites are in Malaysia, two in
Indonesia, and one in Thailand. These add 9.5 MWp to Levanta’s portfolio and will
generate over 13 GWh annually.

Sri Lanka / LNG
Sri Lanka opened its first power plant fuelled primarily by LNG – the Sobadhanavi 350
MW LNG Combined Cycle Power Plant at Kerawalapitiya. Sri Lanka has generated
around 60% of its electricity from coal and oil in recent years but is looking to gas.
